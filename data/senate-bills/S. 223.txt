SEC. 433. AIRFARES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Armed Forces is comprised of approximately 
        1,450,000 members who are stationed on active duty at more than 
        6,000 military bases in 146 different countries;
            (2) the United States is indebted to the members of the 
        Armed Forces, many of whom are in grave danger due to their 
        engagement in, or exposure to, combat;
            (3) military service, especially in the current war against 
        terrorism, often requires members of the Armed Forces to be 
        separated from their families on short notice, for long periods 
        of time, and under very stressful conditions;
            (4) the unique demands of military service often preclude 
        members of the Armed Forces from purchasing discounted advance 
        airline tickets in order to visit their loved ones at home; and
            (5) it is the patriotic duty of the people of the United 
        States to support the members of the Armed Forces who are 
        defending the Nation's interests around the world at great 
        personal sacrifice.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that each 
United States air carrier should--
            (1) establish for all members of the Armed Forces on active 
        duty reduced air fares that are comparable to the lowest 
        airfare for ticketed flights; and
            (2) offer flexible terms that allow members of the Armed 
        Forces on active duty to purchase, modify, or cancel tickets 
        without time restrictions, fees (including baggage fees), 
        ancillary costs, or penalties.

2007 (72 Fed. Reg. 40357), and adopted into the Clark County 
Development Code in June 2008.
    (b) Limitation.--No structure may be permitted under subsection (a) 
that would constitute a hazard to air navigation, result in an increase 
to minimum flight altitudes, or otherwise pose a significant adverse 
impact on airport or aircraft operations.

        procedures.--The Administrator shall set a target of achieving 
        a minimum of 200 Required Navigation Performance procedures 
        each fiscal year through fiscal year 2012, with 25 percent of

        consistent with the NextGen Implementation Plan.
            (2) Use of third parties.--The Administrator is authorized 
        to provide third parties the ability to design, flight check, 
        and implement Required Navigation Performance approach 
        procedures.
    (b) DOT Inspector General Review of Operational and Approach 
Procedures by a Third Party.--
            (1) Review.--The Inspector General of the Department of 
        Transportation shall conduct a review regarding the 
        effectiveness of the oversight activities conducted by the 
        Administration in connection with any agreement with or

SEC. 512. VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE REPORTING PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Within 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration 
shall--
            (1) take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the 
        Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Process requires inspectors--
                    (A) to evaluate corrective action proposed by an 
                air carrier with respect to a matter disclosed by that 
                air carrier is sufficiently comprehensive in scope and 
                application and applies to all affected aircraft 
                operated by that air carrier before accepting the 
                proposed voluntary disclosure;
                    (B) to verify that corrective action so identified 
                by an air carrier is completed within the timeframe 
                proposed; and
                    (C) to verify by inspection that the carrier's 
                corrective action adequately corrects the problem that 
                was disclosed; and
            (2) establish a second level supervisory review of 
        disclosures under the Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Process 
        before any proposed disclosure is accepted and closed that will 
        ensure that a matter disclosed by an air carrier--
                    (A) has not been previously identified by a Federal 
                Aviation Administration inspector; and
                    (B) has not been previously disclosed by the 
                carrier in the preceding 5 years.
    (b) GAO Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a 
        study of the Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program.
            (2) Review.--In conducting the study, the Comptroller 
        General shall examine, at a minimum, whether--
                    (A) there is evidence that voluntary disclosure is 
                resulting in regulated entities discovering and 
                correcting violations to a greater extent than would 
                otherwise occur if there was no program for immunity 
                from enforcement action;
                    (B) the voluntary disclosure program makes the 
                Federal Aviation Administration aware of violations 
                that it would not have discovered if there was not a 
                program, and if a violation is disclosed voluntarily, 
                whether the Administration insists on stronger 
                corrective actions than would have occurred if the 
                regulated entity knew of a violation, but the 
                Administration did not;
                    (C) the information the Administration gets under 
                the program leads to fewer violations by other 
                entities, either because the information leads other 
                entities to look for similar violations or because the 
                information leads Administration investigators to look 
                for similar violations at other entities; and
                    (D) there is any evidence that voluntary disclosure 
                has improved compliance with regulations, either for 
                the entities making disclosures or for the industry 
                generally.
            (3) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a 
        report to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
        Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on 
        Transportation and Infrastructure on the results of the study 
        conducted under this subsection.

                holder.
            ``(2) Written and oral communications.--For purposes of 
        paragraph (1), an individual shall be considered to be acting 
        as an agent or representative of a certificate holder in a 
        matter before the Federal Aviation Administration if the 
        individual makes any written or oral communication on behalf of

        redevelopment efforts;
            (2) subject to a requirement that the local jurisdiction 
        governing the property interests in question has adopted zoning

        of the proceeds from disposing of the land that is subject to 
        repayment or reinvestment under section 47107(c)(2)(A) of title 
        49, United States Code, the total amount of the grant issued

                the local community and financial return to the airport 
                through the implementation of the redevelopment plan.

SEC. 715. DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM ADJUSTMENTS.

    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of the airport disadvantaged 
business enterprise program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113) to ensure 
that minority- and women-owned businesses do not face barriers because 
of their race or gender and so that they have a fair opportunity to 
compete in Federally assisted airport contracts and concessions.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the 
        enactment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination 
        continues to be a barrier for minority- and women-owned 
        businesses seeking to do business in airport-related markets. 
        This continuing barrier merits the continuation of the airport 
        disadvantaged business enterprise program.
            (2) The Congress has received recent evidence of 
        discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional 
        hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by 
        public and private agencies, news stories, reports of 
        discrimination by organizations and individuals, and 
        discrimination lawsuits. This evidence also shows that race- 
        and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address 
        the problem.
            (3) This evidence demonstrates that discrimination across 
        the nation poses a barrier to full and fair participation in 
        airport related businesses of women business owners and 
        minority business owners in the racial groups detailed in parts 
        23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and has 
        impacted firm development and many aspects of airport related 
        business in the public and private markets.
            (4) This evidence provides a strong basis for the 
        continuation of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program and the airport concessions disadvantaged business 
        enterprise program.
    (c) In General.--Section 47107(e) is amended--
                    (1) by redesignating paragraph (8) as paragraph 
                (9); and
                    (2) by inserting after paragraph (7) the following:
                    ``(8) Mandatory training program for airport 
                concessions.--
                            ``(A) In general.--Not later than one year

                        Improvement Act, the Secretary shall establish 
                        a mandatory training program for persons 
                        described in subparagraph (C) on the 
                        certification of whether a small business 
                        concern in airport concessions qualifies as a 
                        small business concern owned and controlled by 
                        a socially and economically disadvantaged 
                        individual for purposes of paragraph (1).
                            ``(B) Implementation.--The training program 
                        may be implemented by one or more private 
                        entities approved by the Secretary.

                        airport owner or operator who is required to 
                        provide a written assurance under paragraph (1) 
                        that the airport owner or operator will meet 
                        the percentage goal of paragraph (1) or who is 
                        responsible for determining whether or not a 
                        small business concern in airport concessions 
                        qualifies as a small business concern owned and 
                        controlled by a socially and economically 
                        disadvantaged individual for purposes of 
                        paragraph (1).
                            ``(D) Authorization of appropriations.--
                        There are authorized to be appropriated to the 
                        Secretary such sums as may be necessary to

Code, as added by subsection (a).
    (e) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Personal Net Worth Cap; 
Bonding Requirements.--Section 47113 is amended by adding at the end 
the following:
    ``(e) Personal Net Worth Cap.--Not later than 180 days after the 
date of enactment of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and 
Safety Improvement Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to 
adjust the personal net worth cap used in determining whether an

        airline employee receives any airline payment amount and 
        transfers any portion of such amount to a traditional IRA 
        within 180 days of receipt of such amount (or, if later, within 
        180 days of the date of the enactment of this Act), then such 
        amount (to the extent so transferred) shall be treated as a 
        rollover contribution described in section 402(c) of the 
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A qualified airline employee 
        making such a transfer may exclude from gross income the amount 
        transferred, in the taxable year in which the airline payment 
        amount was paid to the qualified airline employee by the 
        commercial passenger airline carrier.
            (2) Transfer of amounts attributable to airline payment 
        amount following rollover to roth ira.--A qualified airline 
        employee who has contributed an airline payment amount to a 
        Roth IRA that is treated as a qualified rollover contribution 
        pursuant to section 125 of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer 
        Recovery Act of 2008, may transfer to a traditional IRA, in a 
        trustee-to-trustee transfer, all or any part of the 
        contribution (together with any net income allocable to such 
        contribution), and the transfer to the traditional IRA will be 
        deemed to have been made at the time of the rollover to the 
        Roth IRA, if such transfer is made within 180 days of the date 
        of the enactment of this Act. A qualified airline employee 
        making such a transfer may exclude from gross income the 
        airline payment amount previously rolled over to the Roth IRA, 
        to the extent an amount attributable to the previous rollover 
        was transferred to a traditional IRA, in the taxable year in 
        which the airline payment amount was paid to the qualified 
        airline employee by the commercial passenger airline carrier. 
        No amount so transferred to a traditional IRA may be treated as 
        a qualified rollover contribution with respect to a Roth IRA 
        within the 5-taxable year period beginning with the taxable 
        year in which such transfer was made.
            (3) Extension of time to file claim for refund.--A 
        qualified airline employee who excludes an amount from gross 
        income in a prior taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) may 
        reflect such exclusion in a claim for refund filed within the 
        period of limitation under section 6511(a) (or, if later, April 
        15, 2012).
    (b) Treatment of Airline Payment Amounts and Transfers for 
Employment Taxes.--For purposes of chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security Act, an airline 
payment amount shall not fail to be treated as a payment of wages by 
the commercial passenger airline carrier to the qualified airline 
employee in the taxable year of payment because such amount is excluded 
from the qualified airline employee's gross income under subsection 
(a).
    (c) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this section--
            (1) Airline payment amount.--

                        against the carrier, any note of the carrier 
                        (or amount paid in lieu of a note being 
                        issued), or any other fixed obligation of the 
                        carrier to pay a lump sum amount.
                The amount of such payment shall be determined without 
                regard to any requirement to deduct and withhold tax 
                from such payment under sections 3102(a) and 3402(a).
                    (B) Exception.--An airline payment amount shall not
