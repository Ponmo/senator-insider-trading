                    TITLE IV--TRANSITION TO TEACHING

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Transition to Teaching Act''.

SEC. 402. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 
        teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the areas 
        of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special education, 
        and bilingual education, and for those able to teach in high-
        poverty school districts will be particularly high. To meet 
        this need, talented Americans of all ages should be recruited 
        to become successful, qualified teachers.
            (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have 
        neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main 
        assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty 
        schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.
            (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) 
        ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 
        countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is 
        also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on 
        academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on the 
        academic preparation of our children in mathematics and 
        science.
            (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very 
        difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly half 
        of public school teachers have students in their classrooms for 
        whom English is a second language.
            (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-
        area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need 
        assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training and 
        classroom experience.
            (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful 
        in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty 
        districts.

SEC. 403. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this title is to address the need of high-poverty 
school districts for highly qualified teachers in particular subject 
areas, such as mathematics, science, foreign languages, bilingual 
education, and special education, needed by those school districts, by 
recruiting, preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing 
professionals who have knowledge and experience that will help them 
become such teachers.

        aide, the State may offer to enter into an agreement under this 
        subsection with the first local educational agency identified 
        under subsection (b)(3) that employs the participant as a full-
        time teacher's aide.
            (3) Agreements contracts.--Under an agreement referred to 
        in paragraph (1) or (2)--
                    (A) the local educational agency shall agree to 
                employ the eligible individual full time for not less 
                than 2 consecutive school years (at a basic salary to 
                be certified to the State) in a school of the local 
                educational agency that--
                            (i) serves a concentration of children from 
                        low-income families; and
                            (ii) has an exceptional need for eligible 
                        individuals; and
                    (B) the State shall agree to pay to the local 
                educational agency for each eligible individual, from 
                amounts provided under this section, $5,000 per year 
                for a maximum of 2 years.
    (h) Reimbursement Under Certain Circumstances.--
            (1) In general.--If an eligible individual in the placement 
        program fails to obtain teacher certification or licensure, 
        employment as an elementary school or secondary school teacher, 
        or employment as a teacher's aide as required under the 
        agreement or voluntarily leaves, or is terminated for cause, 
        from the employment during the 2 years of required service, the 
        eligible individual shall be required to reimburse the State 
        for any stipend paid to the eligible individual under 
        subsection (f)(1) in an amount that bears the same ratio to the 
        amount of the stipend as the unserved portion of required 
        service bears to the 2 years of required service. A State shall 
        forward the proceeds of any reimbursement received under this 
        paragraph to the Secretary.
            (2) Obligation to reimburse.--The obligation to reimburse 
        the State under this subsection is, for all purposes, a debt 
        owing the United States. A discharge in bankruptcy under title 
        11 shall not release a participant from the obligation to 
        reimburse the State. Any amount owed by an eligible individual 
        under paragraph (1) shall bear interest at the rate equal to 
        the highest rate being paid by the United States on the day on 
        which the reimbursement is determined to be due for securities 
        having maturities of 90 days or less and shall accrue from the 
        day on which the eligible individual is first notified of the 
        amount due.
    (i) Exceptions to Reimbursement Provisions.--
            (1) In general.--An eligible individual in the placement 
        program shall not be considered to be in violation of an 
        agreement entered into under subsection (e) during any period 
        in which the participant--
                    (A) is pursuing a full-time course of study related 
                to the field of teaching at an institution of higher 
                education;
                    (B) is serving on active duty as a member of the 
                Armed Forces;
                    (C) is temporarily totally disabled for a period of 
                time not to exceed 3 years as established by sworn 
                affidavit of a qualified physician;
                    (D) is unable to secure employment for a period not 
                to exceed 12 months by reason of the care required by a 
                spouse who is disabled;
                    (E) is seeking and unable to find full-time 
                employment as a teacher or teacher's aide in an 
                elementary school or secondary school for a single 
                period not to exceed 27 months; or
                    (F) satisfies the provisions of additional 
                reimbursement exceptions that may be prescribed by the 
                Secretary.
            (2) Forgiveness.--An eligible individual shall be excused 
        from reimbursement under subsection (h) if the eligible 
        individual becomes permanently totally disabled as established 
        by sworn affidavit of a qualified physician. The Secretary may 
        also waive reimbursement in cases of extreme hardship to the 
        participant, as determined by the Secretary.

SEC. 505. PESTICIDE APPLICATION IN SCHOOLS.

    (a) In General.--Each school that receives Federal funding shall--
            (1) take steps to reduce the exposure of children to 
        pesticides on school grounds, both indoors and outdoors; and
            (2) provide parents and guardians of children that attend 
        the school with advance notification of certain pesticide 
        applications on school grounds in accordance with subsections 
        (b) and (c).
    (b) EPA List of Toxic Pesticides.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency shall distribute to each school that receives

        Protection Agency that guides schools in the establishment of a 
        least toxic pesticide policy.
            (2) List.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency shall provide each school that receives 
        Federal funding with a list of pesticides that contain a 
        substance that the Administrator has identified as a known 
        carcinogen, a developmental or reproductive toxin, or a 
        category I or II acute nerve toxin.
    (c) Parental Notification of Toxic Pesticide Applications in 
Schools.--
            (1) In general.--On or after the date that is 18 months 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, any school that 
        receives Federal funding shall not apply any pesticide 
        described in paragraph (b)(2) on school grounds, either indoors 
        or outdoors, unless an administrative official of the school 
        provides notice of the planned application to parents and 
        guardians of children that attend the school not later than 48 
        hours before the application of the pesticide.
            (2) Notice.--The notice described in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) shall include--
                            (i) a description of the intended area of 
                        application; and
                            (ii) the name of each pesticide to be

            (3) Incorporation of notice.--The notice described in 
        paragraph (1) may be incorporated in any notice that is being

SEC. 506. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:
            (1) Every school child in America should have a safe 
        learning environment free from violence and illegal drugs.
            (2) Violence and illegal drugs in the schools undermine a 
        safe and secure learning environment.
            (3) Any instance of violence or illegal drugs in schools is 
        unacceptable and undermines the efforts of Congress, State and 
        local governments and school boards, and parents to provide 
        American children with the best education possible.
            (4) In the last 12 months, there have been at least 50 
        people killed or injured in school shootings in America.
            (5) From 1992 through 1998, the number of referrals made by 
        the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to the Federal 
        Bureau of Investigation for Federal firearms prosecutions fell 
        44 percent, which resulted in a 40-percent drop in prosecutions 
        and a 31-percent decline in convictions, allowing criminals to 
        remain on the streets preying on our most vulnerable citizens, 
        including our children.
            (6) From 1996 to 1998, the Justice Department only 
        prosecuted an average of seven persons per year for illegally 
        transferring a handgun to a juvenile.
            (7) Since 1992, the percentage of 8th grade students using 
        marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the past 30 days has 
        increased 162 percent, 86 percent, and 50 percent, 
        respectively, according to the respected Monitoring the Future 
        survey.
            (8) The February 29, 2000, shooting at Buell Elementary 
        School in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, is evidence that gun 
        violence in American schools continues, that the drug culture 
        contributes to youth violence, and that the breakdown of the 
        American family has contributed to the increase in violence 
        among American children.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program that Congress 
soon will be considering should target the elimination of illegal drugs 
and violence in our schools and should encourage local schools to 
insist on zero-tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug 
use.

SEC. 507. REDUCTION IN SCHOOL VIOLENCE.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``School 
Violence Reduction Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:
            (1) Every school child in America has a right to a safe 
        learning environment free from guns and violence.
            (2) The United States Department of Education report on the 
        Implementation of the Gun-Free Schools Act found that 3,930 
        children were expelled for bringing guns to school during the 
        1997-98 school year.
            (3) Nationwide, 57 percent of the expulsions were high 
        school students, 33 percent were in junior high and 10 percent 
        were in elementary school.
    (c) Grants.--The Secretary of Education shall award grants to 
elementary and secondary schools (as such terms are defined in section 
14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
8801)) to enable such schools to--
            (1) develop and disseminate model programs to reduce 
        violence in schools,
            (2) educate students about the dangers associated with 
        guns, and
            (3) provide violence prevention information (including 
        information about safe gun storage) to children and their 
        parents.
    (d) Application.--To be eligible to receive a grant under 
subsection (b), an elementary or secondary school shall prepare and 
submit to the Secretary of Education an application at such time, in 
such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may 
require.
    (e) Public Service Announcements.--The Secretary of Education shall 
provide for the development and dissemination of public service 
announcements and other information on ways to reduce violence in our 
Nation's schools, including safe gun storage and other measures.
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying 
out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated funds of up 
to $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and such sums as may be necessary 
for each of the four succeeding fiscal years.

            Passed the Senate March 2, 2000.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
