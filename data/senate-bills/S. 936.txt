necessary to enable the Armed Forces to conduct a strategic or major 
theater war.
    (b) Elements.--The report under subsection (a) shall set forth the 
following:
            (1) The systems or equipment identified under subsection 
        (a) that must be maintained and repaired in Government-owned, 
        Government-operated facilities, using personnel and equipment 
        of the Department, as a result of the Secretary's determination 
        that--
                    (A) the work involves unique or valuable workforce 
                skills that should be maintained in the public sector 
                in the national interest;
                    (B) the base of private sector sources having the 
                capability to perform the workloads includes industry 
                sectors that are vulnerable to work stoppages;
                    (C) the private sector sources having the 
                capability to perform the workloads have insufficient 
                workforce levels or skills to perform the depot-level 
                maintenance and repair workloads--
                            (i) in the quantity necessary, or as 
                        rapidly as the Secretary considers necessary, 
                        to enable the armed forces to fulfill the 
                        national military strategy; or
                            (ii) without a significant disruption or 
                        delay in the maintenance and repair of 
                        equipment;
                    (D) the need for performance of workloads is too 
                infrequent, cyclical, or variable to sustain a reliable 
                base of private sector sources having the workforce 
                levels or skills to perform the workloads;
                    (E) the market conditions or workloads are 
                insufficient to ensure that the price of private sector 
                performance of the workloads can be controlled through 
                competition or other means;
                    (F) private sector sources are not adequately 
                responsive to the requirements of the Department for 
                rapid, cost-effective, and flexible response to surge 
                requirements or other contingency situations, including 
                changes in the mix or priority of previously scheduled 
                workloads and reassignment of employees to different 
                workloads without the requirement for additional 
                contractual negotiations;
                    (G) private sector sources are less willing to 
                assume responsibility for performing the workload as a 
                result of the possibility of direct military or 
                terrorist attack; or
                    (H) private sector sources cannot maintain 
                continuity of workforce expertise as a result of high 
                rates of employee turnover.
            (2) The systems or equipment identified under subsection 
        (a) that must be maintained and repaired in Government-owned 
        facilities, whether Government operated or contractor-operated, 
        as a result of the Secretary's determination that--
                    (A) the work involves facilities, technologies, or 
                equipment that are unique and sufficiently valuable 
                that the facilities, technologies, or equipment must be 
                maintained in the public sector in the national 
                interest;
                    (B) the private sector sources having the 
                capability to perform the workloads have insufficient 
                facilities, technology, or equipment to perform the 
                depot-level maintenance and repair workloads--
                            (i) in the quantity necessary, or as 
                        rapidly as the Secretary considers necessary, 
                        to enable the armed forces to fulfill the 
                        national military strategy; or
                            (ii) without a significant disruption or 
                        delay in the maintenance and repair of 
                        equipment; or
                    (C) the need for performance of workloads is too 
                infrequent, cyclical, or variable to sustain a reliable 
                base of private sector sources having the facilities, 
                technology, or equipment to perform the workloads.
            (3) The systems or equipment identified under subsection 
        (a) that may be maintained and repaired in private sector 
        facilities.
            (4) The approximate percentage of the total maintenance and 
        repair workload of the Department of Defense necessary for the 
        systems and equipment identified under subsection (a) that 
        would be performed at Department of Defense facilities, and at 
        private sector facilities, as a result of the determinations 
        made for purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).

SEC. 316. REVIEW OF USE OF TEMPORARY DUTY ASSIGNMENTS FOR SHIP REPAIR 
              AND MAINTENANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In order to reduce the time that the crew of a naval 
        vessel is away from the homeport of the vessel, the Navy seeks 
        to perform ship repair and maintenance of the vessel at the 
        homeport of the vessel whenever it takes six months or less to 
        accomplish the work involved.
            (2) At the same time, the Navy seeks to distribute ship 
        repair and maintenance work among the Navy shipyards (known as 
        to ``level load'') in order to more fully utilize personnel 
        resources.
            (3) During periods when a Navy shipyard is not utilized to 
        its capacity, the Navy sometimes sends workers at the shipyard, 
        on a temporary duty basis, to perform ship repairs and 
        maintenance at a homeport not having a Navy shipyard.
            (4) This practice is a more efficient use of civilian 
        employees who might otherwise not be fully employed on work 
        assigned to Navy shipyards.
    (b) GAO Review and Report.--(1) The Comptroller General of the 
United States shall review the Navy's practice of using temporary duty 
assignments of personnel to perform ship maintenance and repair work at 
homeports not having Navy shipyards. The review shall include the 
following:
            (A) An assessment of the rationale, conditions, and factors 
        supporting the Navy's practice.
            (B) A determination of whether the practice is cost-
        effective.
            (C) The factors affecting future requirements for, and the 
        adherence to, the practice, together with an assessment of the 
        factors.
    (2) Not later than May 1, 1998, the Comptroller General shall 
submit a report on the review to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of 
Representatives.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
transfer of the ground communication-electronic workload to Tobyhanna 
Army Depot, Pennsylvania, in the realignment of the performance of such 
function should be carried out in adherence to the schedule prescribed 
for that transfer by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council on March 13, 
1997, as follows:
            (1) Transfer of 20 percent of the workload in fiscal year 
        1998.
            (2) Transfer of 40 percent of the workload in fiscal year 
        1999.
            (3) Transfer of 40 percent of the workload in fiscal year 
        2000.
    (b) Prohibition.--No provision of this Act that authorizes or 
provides for contracting for the performance of a depot-level 
maintenance and repair workload by a private sector source at a 
location where the workload was performed before fiscal year 1998 shall 
apply to the workload referred to in subsection (a).

SEC. 708. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR RETIREES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Many retired military personnel believe that they were 
        promised lifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years 
        of service.
            (2) Military retirees are the only Federal Government 
        personnel who have been prevented from using their employer-
        provided health care at or after 65 years of age.
            (3) Military health care has become increasingly difficult 
        to obtain for military retirees as the Department of Defense 
        reduces its health care infrastructure.
            (4) Military retirees deserve to have a health care program 
        at least comparable with that of retirees from civilian 
        employment by the Federal Government.
            (5) The availability of quality, lifetime health care is a 
        critical recruiting incentive for the Armed Forces.
            (6) Quality health care is a critical aspect of the quality 
        of life of the men and women serving in the Armed Forces.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States has incurred a moral obligation to 
        provide health care to retirees from service in the Armed 
        Forces;
            (2) it is, therefore, necessary to provide quality, 
        affordable health care to such retirees; and
            (3) Congress and the President should take steps to address 
        the problems associated with health care for such retirees 
        within two years after the date of the enactment of this Act.

        included in the force structure recommended in the Quadrennial 
        Defense Review, including all other planned force enhancements.
    (d) Assessment Elements.--(1) The report shall identify, by unit 
type, all major units of the active and reserve components of the Armed 
Forces and assess the readiness requirements of the units. Each 
identified unit shall be categorized within one of the following 
classifications:
            (A) Forward-deployed and crisis response forces, or ``Tier 
        I'' forces, that possess limited internal sustainment 
        capability and do not require immediate access to regional air 
        bases or ports or overflight rights, including the following:
                    (i) Force units that are deployed in rotation at 
                sea or on land outside the United States.
                    (ii) Combat-ready crises response forces that are 
                capable of mobilizing and deploying within 10 days 
                after receipt of orders.
                    (iii) Forces that are supported by prepositioning 
                equipment afloat or are capable of being inserted into 
                a theater upon the capture of a port or airfield by 
                forcible entry forces.
            (B) Combat-ready follow-on forces, or ``Tier II'' forces, 
        that can be mobilized and deployed to a theater within 
        approximately 60 days after receipt of orders.
            (C) Combat-ready conflict resolution forces, or ``Tier 
        III'' forces, that can be mobilized and deployed to a theater 
        within approximately 180 days after receipt of orders.
            (D) All other active and reserve component force units 
        which are not categorized within a classification described in 
        subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).
    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the following units are 
major units:
            (A) In the case of the Army or Marine Corps, a brigade and 
        a battalion.
            (B) In the case of the Navy, a squadron of aircraft, a 
        ship, and a squadron of ships.
            (C) In the case of the Air Force, a squadron of aircraft.
    (e) Projection of Savings for Use for Modernization.--The report 
shall include a projection for fiscal years 1998 through 2003 of the 
amounts of the savings in operation and maintenance funding that--
            (1) could be derived by each of the Armed Forces by placing 
        as many units as is practicable into the lower readiness 
        categories among the tiers; and
            (2) could be made available for force modernization.
    (f) Form of Report.--The report under this section shall be 
submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex.
    (g) Planned Force Enhancement Defined.--In this section, the term 
``planned force enhancement'', with respect to the force structure 
recommended in the Quadrennial Defense Review, means any future 
improvement in the capability of the force (including current strategic 
and future improvement in strategic lift capability) that is assumed in 
the development of the recommendation for the force structure set forth 
in the Quadrennial Defense Review.

SEC. 1035. ASSESSMENT OF CYCLICAL READINESS POSTURE OF THE ARMED 
              FORCES.

    (a) Requirement.--(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National 
Security of the House of Representatives a report on the readiness 
posture of the Armed Forces described in subsection (b).
    (2) The Secretary shall prepare the report required under paragraph 
(1) with the assistance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In providing such 
assistance, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall consult 
with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.
    (b) Readiness Posture.--(1) The readiness posture to be covered by 
the report under subsection (a) is a readiness posture for units of the 
Armed Forces, or for designated units of the Armed Forces, that 
provides for a rotation of such units between a state of high readiness 
and a state of low readiness.
    (2) As part of the evaluation of the readiness posture described in 
paragraph (1), the report shall address in particular a readiness 
posture that--
            (A) establishes within the Armed Forces two equivalent 
        forces each structured so as to be capable of fighting and 
        winning a major theater war; and
            (B) provides for an alternating rotation of such forces 
        between a state of high readiness and a state of low readiness.
    (3) The evaluation of the readiness posture described in paragraph 
(2) shall be based upon assumptions permitting comparison with the 
existing force structure as follows:
            (A) That there are assembled from among the units of the 
        Armed Forces two equivalent forces each structured so as to be 
        capable of fighting and winning a major theater war.
            (B) That each force referred to in subparagraph (A) 
        includes--
                    (i) four active Army divisions, including one 
                mechanized division, one armored division, one light 
                infantry division, and one division combining airborne 
                units and air assault units, and appropriate support 
                and service support units for such divisions;
                    (ii) six divisions (or division equivalents) of the 
                Army National Guard or the Army Reserve that are 
                essentially equivalent in structure, and appropriate 
                support and service support units for such divisions;
                    (iii) six aircraft carrier battle groups;
                    (iv) six active Air Force fighter wings (or fighter 
                wing equivalents);
                    (v) four Air Force reserve fighter wings (or 
                fighter wing equivalents); and
                    (vi) one active Marine Corps expeditionary force.
            (C) That each force may be supplemented by critical units 
        or units in short supply, including heavy bomber units, 
        strategic lift units, and aerial reconnaissance units, that are 
        not subject to the readiness rotation otherwise assumed for 
        purposes of the evaluation or are subject to the rotation on a 
        modified basis.
            (D) That units of the Armed Forces not assigned to a force 
        are available for operations other than those essential to 
        fight and win a major theater war, including peace operations.
            (E) That the state of readiness of each force alternates 
        between a state of high readiness and a state of low readiness 
        on a frequency determined by the Secretary (but not more often 
        than once every 6 months) and with only one force at a given 
        state of readiness at any one time.
            (F) That, during the period of state of high readiness of a 
        force, any operations or activities (including leave and 
        education and training of personnel) that detract from the 
        near-term wartime readiness of the force are temporary and 
        their effects on such state of readiness minimized.
            (G) That units are assigned overseas during the period of 
        state of high readiness of the force to which the units are 
        assigned primarily on a temporary duty basis.
            (H) That, during the period of high readiness of a force, 
        the operational war plans for the force incorporate the 
        divisions (or division equivalents) of the Army Reserve or Army 
        National Guard assigned to the force in a manner such that one 
        such division (or division equivalent) is, on a rotating basis 
        for such divisions (or division equivalents) during the period, 
        maintained in a high state of readiness and dedicated as the 
        first reserve combat division to be transferred overseas in the 
        event of a major theater war.
    (c) Report Elements.--The report under this section shall include 
the following elements for the readiness posture described in 
subsection (b)(2):
            (1) An estimate of the range of cost savings achievable 
        over the long term as a result of implementing the readiness 
        posture, including--
                    (A) the savings achievable from reduced training 
                levels and readiness levels during periods in which a 
                force referred to in subsection (b)(3)(A) is in a state 
                of low readiness; and
                    (B) the savings achievable from reductions in costs 
                of infrastructure overseas as a result of reduced 
                permanent change of station rotations.
            (2) An assessment of the potential risks associated with a 
        lower readiness status for units assigned to a force in a state 
        of low readiness under the readiness posture, including the 
        risks associated with the delayed availability of such units 
        overseas in the event of two nearly simultaneous major theater 
        wars.
            (3) An assessment of the potential risks associated with 
        requiring the forces under the readiness posture to fight a 
        major war in any theater worldwide.
            (4) An assessment of the modifications of the current force 
        structure of the Armed Forces that are necessary to achieve the 
        range of cost savings estimated under paragraph (1), including 
        the extent of the diminishment, if any, of the military 
        capabilities of the Armed Forces as a result of the 
        modifications.
            (5) An assessment whether or not the risks of diminished 
        military capability associated with implementation of the 
        readiness posture exceed the risks of diminished military 
        capability associated with the modifications of the current 
        force structure necessary to achieve cost savings equivalent to 
        the best case for cost savings resulting from the 
        implementation of the readiness posture.
    (d) Form of Report.--The report under this section shall be 
submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified annex.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``state of high readiness'', in the case of a 
        military force, means the capability to mobilize first-to-
        arrive units of the force within 18 hours and last-to-arrive 
        units within 120 days of a particular event.
            (2) The term ``state of low readiness'', in the case of a 
        military force, means the capability to mobilize first-to-
        arrive units within 90 days and last-to-arrive units within 180 
        days of a particular event.

SEC. 1036. OVERSEAS INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) United States military forces have been withdrawn from 
        the Philippines.
            (2) United States military forces are to be withdrawn from 
        Panama by 2000.
            (3) There continues to be local opposition to the continued 
        presence of United States military forces in Okinawa.
            (4) The Quadrennial Defense Review lists ``the loss of U.S. 
        access to critical facilities and lines of communication in key 
        regions'' as one of the so-called ``wild card'' scenarios 
        covered in the review.
            (5) The National Defense Panel states that ``U.S. forces' 
        long-term access to forward bases, to include air bases, ports, 
        and logistics facilities, cannot be assumed''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should develop alternatives to the 
        current arrangement for forward basing of the Armed Forces 
        outside the United States, including alternatives to the 
        existing infrastructure for forward basing of forces and 
        alternatives to the existing international agreements that 
        provide for basing of United States forces in foreign 
        countries; and
            (2) because the Pacific Rim continues to emerge as a region 
        of significant economic and military importance to the United 
        States, a continued presence of the Armed Forces in that region 
        is vital to the capability of the United States to timely 
        protect its interests in the region.
    (c) Report Required.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the Secretary 
of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of 
Representatives a report on the overseas infrastructure requirements of 
the Armed Forces.
    (d) Content.--The report shall contain the following:
            (1) The quantity and types of forces that the United States 
        must station in each region of the world in order to support 
        the current national military strategy of the United States.
            (2) The quantity and types of forces that the United States 
        will need to station in each region of the world in order to 
        meet the expected or potential future threats to the national 
        security interests of the United States.
            (3) The requirements for access to, and use of, air space 
        and ground maneuver areas in each such region for training for 
        the quantity and types of forces identified for the region 
        pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2).
            (4) A list of the international agreements, currently in 
        force, that the United States has entered into with foreign 
        countries regarding the basing of United States forces in those 
        countries and the dates on which the agreements expire.
            (5) A discussion of any anticipated political opposition or 
        other opposition to the renewal of any of those international 
        agreements.
            (6) A discussion of future overseas basing requirements for 
        United States forces, taking into account expected changes in 
        national security strategy, national security environment, and 
        weapons systems.
            (7) The expected costs of maintaining the overseas 
        infrastructure for foreign based forces of the United States, 
        including the costs of constructing any new facilities that 
        will be necessary overseas to meet emerging requirements 
        relating to the national security interests of the United 
        States.
    (e) Form of Report.--The report may be submitted in a classified or 
unclassified form.

              OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES ABROAD FROM TERRORIST 
              ATTACK.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On June 25, 1996, a bomb detonated not more than 80 
        feet from the Air Force housing complex known as Khobar Towers 
        in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 members of the Air Force 
        and injuring hundreds more.
            (2) On June 13, 1996, a report by the Bureau of 
        Intelligence and Research of the Department of State 
        highlighted security concerns in the region in which Dharhan is 
        located.
            (3) On June 17, 1996, the Department of Defense received an 
        intelligence report detailing a high level of risk to the 
        complex.
            (4) In January 1996, the Office of Special Investigations 
        of the Air Force issued a vulnerability assessment for the 
        complex, which assessment highlighted the vulnerability of 
        perimeter security at the complex given the proximity of the 
        complex to a boundary fence and the lack of the protective 
        coating Mylar on its windows.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of

        are proposed or implemented as a result of the assessment.
            (2) An assessment of the procedures of the Department of 
        Defense intended to determine accountability, if any, in the 
        command structure in instances in which a terrorist attack 
        results in the loss of life at an installation or facility of 
        the Armed Forces abroad.

SEC. 1044. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FAMILY NOTIFICATION AND 
              ASSISTANCE PROCEDURES IN CASES OF MILITARY AVIATION 
              ACCIDENTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There is a need for the Department of Defense to 
        improve significantly the family notification procedures of the 
        department that are applicable in cases of Armed Forces 
        personnel casualties and Department of Defense civilian 
        personnel casualties resulting from military aviation 
        accidents.
            (2) This need was demonstrated in the aftermath of the 
        tragic crash of a C-130 aircraft off the coast of Northern 
        California that killed 10 Reserves from Oregon on November 22, 
        1996.
            (3) The experience of the members of the families of those 
        Reserves has left the family members with a general perception 
        that the existing Department of Defense procedures for 
        notifications regarding casualties and related matters did not 
        meet the concerns and needs of the families.
            (4) It is imperative that Department of Defense 
        representatives involved in family notifications regarding 
        casualties have the qualifications and experience to provide 
        meaningful information on accident investigations and effective 
        grief counseling.
            (5) Military families deserve the best possible care, 
        attention, and information, especially at a time of tragic 
        personal loss.
            (6) Although the Department of Defense provides much needed 
        logistical support, including transportation and care of 
        remains, survivor counseling, and other benefits in cases of 
        tragedies like the crash of the C-130 aircraft on November 22, 
        1996, the support may be insufficient to meet the immediate 
        emotional and personal needs of family members affected by such 
        tragedies.
            (7) It is important that the flow of information to 
        surviving family members be accurate and timely, and be 
        provided to family members in advance of media reports, and, 
        therefore, that the Department of Defense give a high priority, 
        to the extent practicable, to providing the family members with 
        all relevant information on an accident as soon as it becomes 
        available, consistent with the national security interests of 
        the United States, and to allowing the family members full 
        access to any public hearings or public meetings about the 
        accident.
            (8) Improved procedures for civilian family notification 
        that have been adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration 
        and National Transportation Safety Board might serve as a 
        useful model for reforms to Department of Defense procedures.
    (b) Reports by Secretary of Defense.--(1) Not later than December 
1, 1997, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on 
the advisability of establishing a process for conducting a single, 
public investigation of each Department of Defense aviation accident 
that is similar to the accident investigation process of the National 
Transportation Safety Board. The report shall include--
            (A) a discussion of whether adoption of the accident 
        investigation process of the National Transportation Safety 
        Board by the Department of Defense would result in benefits 
        that include the satisfaction of needs of members of families 
        of victims of the accident, increased aviation safety, and 
        improved maintenance of aircraft;
            (B) a determination of whether the Department of Defense 
        should adopt that accident investigation process; and
            (C) any justification for the current practice of the 
        Department of Defense of conducting separate accident and 
        safety investigations.
    (2) Not later than April 2, 1998, the Secretary of Defense shall 
submit to Congress a report on assistance provided by the Department of 
Defense to families of casualties among Armed Forces and civilian 
personnel of the department. The report shall include--
            (A) a discussion of the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
        family notification procedures of the Department of Defense, 
        including the procedures of the military departments; and
            (B) a description of the assistance provided to members of 
        the families of such personnel.
    (c) Report by Department of Defense Inspector General.--(1) Not 
later than December 1, 1997, the Inspector General of the Department of 
Defense shall review the procedures of the Federal Aviation 
Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board for 
providing information and assistance to members of families of 
casualties of nonmilitary aviation accidents, and submit a report on 
the review to Congress. The report shall include a discussion of the 
following matters:
            (A) Designation of an experienced non-profit organization 
        to provide assistance for satisfying needs of families of 
        accident victims.
            (B) An assessment of the system and procedures for 
        providing families with information on accidents and accident 
        investigations.
            (C) Protection of members of families from unwanted 
        solicitations relating to the accident.
            (D) A recommendation regarding whether the procedures or 
        similar procedures should be adopted by the Department of 
        Defense, and if the recommendation is not to adopt the 
        procedures, a detailed justification for the recommendation.
    (d) Unclassified Form of Reports.--The reports under subsections 
(b) and (c) shall be submitted in unclassified form.

SEC. 1045. REPORT ON HELSINKI JOINT STATEMENT.

    (a) Requirement.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the President 
shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the 
Helsinki Joint Statement on future reductions in nuclear forces. The 
report shall address the United States approach (including verification 
implications) to implementing the Helsinki Joint Statement, in 
particular, as it relates to: lower aggregate levels of strategic 
nuclear warheads; measures relating to the transparency of strategic 
nuclear warhead inventories and the destruction of strategic nuclear 
warheads; deactivation of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles; measures 
relating to nuclear long-range sea-launched cruise missiles and 
tactical nuclear systems; and issues related to transparency in nuclear 
materials.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``Helsinki Joint Statement'' means the 
        agreements between the President of the United States and the 
        President of the Russian Federation as contained in the Joint 
        Statement on Parameters on Future Reductions in Nuclear Forces 
        issued at Helsinki in March 1997.
            (2) The term ``START II TREATY'' means the Treaty Between 
        the United States of America and the Russian Federation on 
        Further Reduction and Limitation on Strategic Offensive Arms, 
        signed at Moscow on January 3, 1993, including any protocols 
        and memoranda of understanding associated with the treaty.

SEC. 1046. ASSESSMENT OF THE CUBAN THREAT TO UNITED STATES NATIONAL 
              SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has been an avowed enemy of Cuba for 
        over 35 years, and Fidel Castro has made hostility towards the 
        United States a principal tenet of his domestic and foreign 
        policy.
            (2) The ability of the United States as a sovereign nation 
        to respond to any Cuban provocation is directly related to the 
        ability of the United States to defend the people and territory 
        of the United States against any Cuban attack.
            (3) In 1994, the Government of Cuba callously encouraged a 
        massive exodus of Cubans, by boat and raft, toward the United 
        States.
            (4) Countless numbers of those Cubans lost their lives on 
        the high seas as a result of those actions of the Government of 
        Cuba.
            (5) The humanitarian response of the United States to 
        rescue, shelter, and provide emergency care to those Cubans, 
        together with the actions taken to absorb some 30,000 of those 
        Cubans into the United States, required immeasurable efforts 
        and expenditures of hundreds of millions of dollars for the 
        costs incurred by the United States and State and local 
        governments in connection with those efforts.
            (6) On February 24, 1996, Cuban MiG aircraft attacked and 
        destroyed, in international airspace, two unarmed civilian 
        aircraft flying from the United States, and the four persons in 
        those unarmed civilian aircraft were killed.
            (7) Since the attack, the Cuban government has issued no 
        apology for the attack, nor has it indicated any intention to 
        conform its conduct to international law that is applicable to 
        civilian aircraft operating in international airspace.
    (b) Review and Report.--Not later than March 30, 1998, the 
Secretary of Defense shall carry out a comprehensive review and 
assessment of Cuban military capabilities and the threats to the 
national security of the United States that are posed by Fidel Castro 
and the Government of Cuba and submit a report on the review to the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National 
Security of the House of Representatives. The report shall contain--
            (1) a discussion of the results of the review, including an 
        assessment of the contingency plans; and
            (2) the Secretary's assessment of the threats, including--
                    (A) such unconventional threats as--
                            (i) encouragement of migration crises; and
                            (ii) attacks on citizens and residents of 
                        the United States while they are engaged in 
                        peaceful protest in international waters or 
                        airspace;
                    (B) the potential for development and delivery of 
                chemical or biological weapons; and
                    (C) the potential for internal strife in Cuba that 
                could involve citizens or residents of the United 
                States or the Armed Forces of the United States.
    (c) Consultation on Review and Assessment.--In performing the 
review and preparing the assessment, the Secretary of Defense shall 
consult with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commander-
in-Chief of the United States Southern Command, and the heads of other 
appropriate agencies of the Federal Government.

Defense shall submit to Congress a report--
            (1) assessing the level of dependence on foreign sources 
        for procurement of certain resistors and capacitors and 
        projecting the level of such dependence that is likely to 
        obtain after the implementation of relevant tariff reductions 
        required by the Information Technology Agreement; and
            (2) recommending appropriate changes, if any, in defense 
        procurement or other Federal policies on the basis of the 
        national security implications of such actual or projected 
        foreign dependence.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``certain 
resistors and capacitors'' shall mean--
            (1) fixed resistors,
            (2) wirewound resistors,
            (3) film resistors,
            (4) solid tantalum capacitors,

              ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND UNITED STATES OBLIGATIONS UNDER 
              THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Chemical Weapons Convention requires the 
        destruction of the United States stockpile of lethal chemical 
        agents and munitions within 10 years after the Convention's 
        entry into force (or 2007).
            (2) The President possesses substantial powers under 
        existing law to ensure that the technologies necessary to 
        destroy the stockpile are developed, that the facilities 
        necessary to destroy the stockpile are constructed, and that 
        Federal, State, and local environmental laws and regulations do 
        not impair the ability of the United States to comply with its 
        obligations under the Convention.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
President--
            (1) should use the authority granted the President under 
        existing law to ensure that the United States is able to 
        construct and operate the facilities necessary to destroy the 
        United States stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions 
        within the time allowed by the Chemical Weapons Convention; and

              MODERNIZATION NOT REQUESTED IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET REQUEST.

    (a) Limitation.--It is the sense of Congress that, to the maximum 
extent practicable, Congress should consider authorizing appropriations 
for reserve component modernization activities not included in the 
budget request of the Department of Defense for a fiscal year only if--
            (1) there is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council 
        validated requirement for the equipment;
            (2) the equipment is included for reserve component 
        modernization in the modernization plan of the military 
        department concerned and is incorporated into the future-years 
        defense program;
            (3) the equipment is consistent with the use of reserve 
        component forces;
            (4) the equipment is necessary in the national security 
        interests of the United States; and
            (5) the funds can be obligated in the fiscal year.
    (b) Views of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.--It is further 
the sense of Congress that, in applying the criteria set forth in

              INTELLIGENCE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED BY THE INTELLIGENCE 
              COMMUNITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Coordination of operational intelligence support for 
        the commanders of the combatant commands and deployed units of 
        the Armed Forces has proven to be inadequate.
            (2) Procedures used to reconcile information among various 
        intelligence community and Department of Defense data bases 
        proved to be inadequate and, being inadequate, diminished the 
        usefulness of that information and preclude commanders and 
        planners within the Armed Forces from fully benefiting from key 
        information that should have been available to them.
            (3) Excessive compartmentalization of responsibilities and 
        information within the Department of Defense and the other 
        elements of the intelligence community resulted in inaccurate 
        analysis of important intelligence material.
            (4) Excessive restrictions on the distribution of 
        information within the executive branch disadvantaged units of 
        the Armed Forces that would have benefited most from the 
        information.
            (5) Procedures used in the Department of Defense to ensure 
        that critical intelligence information is provided to the right 
        combat units in a timely manner failed during the Persian Gulf 
        War and, as a result, information about potential chemical 
        weapons storage locations did not reach the units that 
        eventually destroyed those storage areas.
            (6) A recent, detailed review of the events leading to and 
        following the destruction of chemical weapons by members of the 
        Armed Forces at Khamisiyah, Iraq, during the Persian Gulf War 
        has revealed a number of inadequacies in the way the Department 
        of Defense and the other elements of the intelligence community 
        handled, distributed, recorded, and stored intelligence 
        information about the threat of exposure of United States 
        forces to chemical weapons and the toxic agents in those 
        weapons.
            (7) The inadequacy of procedures for recording the receipt 
        of, and reaction to, intelligence reports provided by the 
        intelligence community to combat units of the Armed Forces 
        during the Persian Gulf War has caused it to be impossible to 
        analyze the failures in transmission of intelligence-related 
        information on the location of chemical weapons at Khamisiyah, 
        Iraq, that resulted in the demolition of chemical weapons by 
        members of the Armed Forces unaware of the hazards to which 
        they were exposed.
    (b) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than March 1, 1998, the 
Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report that identifies 
the specific actions that have been taken or are being taken to ensure 
that there is adequate coordination of operational intelligence support 
for the commanders of the combatant commands and deployed units of the 
Armed Forces.
    (c) Definition of Intelligence Community.--In this section, the 
term ``intelligence community'' has the meaning given the term in 
section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a).

              A CHARTER AIR CARRIER.

    Section 2640 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (h) and (i) as subsections 
        (i) and (j), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (g) the following new 
        subsection (h):
    ``(h) Protection of Voluntarily Submitted Air Safety Information.--
(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the appropriate official may deny a 
request made under any other provision of law for public disclosure of 
safety-related information that has been provided voluntarily by an air 
carrier to the Secretary of Defense for the purposes of this section, 
notwithstanding the provision of law under which the request is made.
    ``(2) The appropriate official may exercise authority to deny a 
request for disclosure of information under paragraph (1) if the 
official first determines that--
            ``(A) the disclosure of the information as requested would 
        inhibit an air carrier from voluntarily disclosing, in the 
        future, safety-related information for the purposes of this 
        section or for other air safety purposes involving the 
        Department of Defense or another Federal agency; and
            ``(B) the receipt of such information generally enhances 
        the fulfillment of responsibilities under this section or other 
        air safety responsibilities involving the Department of Defense 
        or another Federal agency.
    ``(3) For the purposes of this section, the appropriate official 
for exercising authority under paragraph (1) is--
            ``(A) the Secretary of Defense, in the case of a request 
        for disclosure of information that is directed to the 
        Department of Defense; or
            ``(B) the head of another Federal agency, in the case of a 
        request that is directed to that Federal agency regarding 
        information described in paragraph (1) that the Federal agency 
        has received from the Department of Defense.''.

SEC. 1064. SUSTAINMENT AND OPERATION OF GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Global Positioning System, with its multiple uses, 
        makes significant contributions to the attainment of the 
        national security and foreign policy goals of the United 
        States, the safety and efficiency of international 
        transportation, and the economic growth, trade, and 
        productivity of the United States.
            (2) The infrastructure for the Global Positioning System, 
        including both space and ground segments of the infrastructure, 
        is vital to the effectiveness of United States and allied 
        military forces and to the protection of the national security 
        interests of the United States.
            (3) In addition to having military uses, the Global 
        Positioning System has essential civil, commercial, and 
        scientific uses.

        and scientific users of the Global Positioning System--
                    (A) there has emerged in the United States a new 
                commercial industry to provide Global Positioning 
                System equipment and related services to the many and 
                varied users of the system; and
                    (B) there have been rapid technical advancements in 
                Global Positioning System equipment and services that 
                have contributed significantly to reductions in the 
                cost of the Global Positioning System and increases in 
                the technical capabilities and availability of the 
                system for military uses.
            (5) It is in the national interest of the United States for 
        the United States--
                    (A) to support continuation of the multiple-use 
                character of the Global Positioning System;
                    (B) to promote broader acceptance and use of the 
                Global Positioning System and the technological 
                standards that facilitate expanded use of the system 
                for civil purposes;
                    (C) to coordinate with other countries to ensure--
                            (i) efficient management of the 
                        electromagnetic spectrum utilized for the 
                        Global Positioning System; and
                            (ii) protection of that spectrum in order 
                        to prevent disruption of, and interference 
                        with, signals from the system; and
                    (D) to encourage open access in all international 
                markets to the Global Positioning System and supporting 
                equipment, services, and techniques.
    (b) Sustainment and Operation for Military Purposes.--The Secretary 
of Defense shall--
            (1) provide for the sustainment of the Global Positioning 
        System capabilities, and the operation of basic Global 
        Positioning System services, that are beneficial for the 
        national security interests of United States;
            (2) develop appropriate measures for preventing hostile use 
        of the Global Positioning System that make it unnecessary to 
        use the selective availability feature of the system 
        continuously and do not hinder the use of the Global 
        Positioning System by the United States and its allies for 
        military purposes; and
            (3) ensure that United States military forces have the 
        capability to use the Global Positioning System effectively 
        despite hostile attempts to prevent the use of the system by 
        such forces.
    (c) Sustainment and Operation for Civilian Purposes.--The Secretary 
of Defense shall--
            (1) provide for the sustainment and operation of basic 
        Global Positioning System services for peaceful civil, 
        commercial, and scientific uses on a continuous worldwide basis 
        free of direct user fees;

SEC. 1074. DESIGNATION OF BOB HOPE AS HONORARY VETERAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has never in its more than 200 years 
        of existence conferred honorary veteran status on any person.
            (2) Honorary veteran status is and should remain an 
        extraordinary honor not lightly conferred nor frequently 
        granted.
            (3) It is fitting and proper to confer that status on Bob 
        Hope.
            (4) Bob Hope attempted to enlist in the Armed Forces to 
        serve his country during World War II but was informed that the 
        greatest service he could provide his country was as a civilian 
        entertainer for the troops.
            (5) Since then, Bob Hope has travelled to visit and 
        entertain millions of members of the Armed Forces of the United 
        States throughout World War II, the Korean Conflict, the 
        Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Cold War, in Europe, 
        Africa, England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Sicily, the Aleutian 
        Islands, Pearl Harbor, Kwajalein Island, Guam, Japan, Korea, 
        Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and many other locations.
            (6) Bob Hope frequently elected to stage his shows in 
        forward combat areas.
            (7) Bob Hope richly deserves the more than 100 awards and 
        citations that he has received from government, military, and 
        civic groups.
            (8) Those awards include the American Congressional Gold 
        Medal, the Medal of Freedom, the People to People Award, the 
        Peabody Award, the Jean Hersholdt Humanitarian Award, the Al 
        Jolson Award of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Medal of 
        Liberty, and the Distinguished Service Medals of each of the 
        Armed Forces.
            (9) Bob Hope has given unselfishly of himself for over half 
        a century to be with American service members on foreign 
        shores, has worked tirelessly to bring a spirit of humor and 
        cheer to millions of military members during their loneliest 
        moments, and has, thereby, extended to them for the American 
        people a touch of home away from home.
    (b) Honorary Designation.--The elected representatives of the 
American people, expressing the gratitude of the American people to Bob 
Hope for his years of unselfish service to the members of the Armed 
Forces of the United States, designate Bob Hope as an honorary veteran 
of the Armed Forces of the United States.

SEC. 1077. NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has fought in many wars, and 
        thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured 
        by the enemy or listed as missing in action.
            (2) Many of these Americans are still missing and 
        unaccounted for, and the uncertainty surrounding their fates 
        has caused their families to suffer tragic and continuing 
        hardships.
            (3) As a symbol of the Nation's concern and commitment to 
        accounting as fully as possible for all Americans still held 
        prisoner, missing, or unaccounted for by reason of their 
        service in the Armed Forces and to honor the Americans who in 
        future wars may be captured or listed as missing or unaccounted 
        for, Congress has officially recognized the National League of 
        Families POW/MIA flag.
            (4) The American people observe and honor with appropriate

SEC. 1079. REPORT ON THE COMMAND SELECTION PROCESS FOR DISTRICT 
              ENGINEERS OF THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Army Corps of Engineers--
                    (A) has served the United States since the 
                establishment of the Corps in 1802;
                    (B) has provided unmatched combat engineering 
                services to the Armed Forces and the allies of the 
                United States, both in times of war and in times of 
                peace;
                    (C) has brilliantly fulfilled its domestic mission 
                of planning, designing, building, and operating civil 
                works and other water resources projects;
                    (D) must remain constantly ready to carry out its 
                wartime mission while simultaneously carrying out its 
                domestic civil works mission; and
                    (E) continues to provide the United States with 
                these services in projects of previously unknown 
                complexity and magnitude, such as the Everglades 
                Restoration Project and the Louisiana Wetlands 
                Restoration Project;
            (2) the duration and complexity of these projects present 
        unique management and leadership challenges to the Army Corps 
        of Engineers;
            (3) the effective management of these projects is the 
        primary responsibility of the District Engineer;
            (4) District Engineers serve in that position for a term of 
        2 years and may have their term extended for a third year on 
        the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers; and
            (5) the effectiveness of the leadership and management of 
        major Army Corps of Engineers projects may be enhanced if the 
        timing of District Engineer reassignments were phased to 
        coincide with the major phases of the projects.
    (b) Report.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the Secretary of 
Defense shall submit a report to Congress that contains--
            (1) an identification of each major Army Corps of Engineers 
        project that--
                    (A) is being carried out by each District Engineer 
                as of the date of the report; or
                    (B) is being planned by each District Engineer to 
                be carried out during the 5-year period beginning on 
                the date of the report;
            (2) the expected start and completion dates, during that 
        period, for each major phase of each project identified under 
        paragraph (1);
            (3) the expected dates for leadership changes in each Army 
        Corps of Engineers District during that period;
            (4) a plan for optimizing the timing of leadership changes 
        so that there is minimal disruption to major phases of major 
        Army Corps of Engineers projects; and
            (5) a review of the impact on the Army Corps of Engineers, 
        and on the mission of each District, of allowing major command 
        tours of District Engineers to be of 2 to 4 years in duration, 
        with the selection of the exact timing of the change of command 
        to be at the discretion of the Chief of Engineers who shall act 
        with the goal of optimizing the timing of each change so that 
        it has minimal disruption on the mission of the District 
        Engineer.

SEC. 1081. CLAIMS BY MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR LOSS OF PERSONAL 
              PROPERTY DUE TO FLOODING IN THE RED RIVER BASIN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The flooding that occurred in the portion of the Red 
        River Basin encompassing East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and Grand 
        Forks, North Dakota, during April and May 1997 is the worst 
        flooding to occur in that region in the last 500 years.
            (2) Over 700 military personnel stationed in the vicinity 
        of Grand Forks Air Force Base reside in that portion of the Red 
        River Basin.
            (3) The military personnel stationed in the vicinity of 
        Grand Forks Air Force Base have been stationed there entirely 
        for the convenience of the Government.
            (4) There is insufficient military family housing at Grand 
        Forks Air Force Base for all of those military personnel, and 
        the available off-base housing is almost entirely within the 
        areas adversely affected by the flood.
            (5) Many of the military personnel have suffered 
        catastrophic losses, including total losses of personal 
        property by some of the personnel.
            (6) It is vital to the national security interests of the 
        United States that the military personnel adversely affected by 
        the flood recover as quickly and completely as possible.
    (b) Authorization.--The Secretary of the military department 
concerned may pay claims for loss and damage to personal property 
suffered as a direct result of the flooding in the Red River Basin 
during April and May 1997, by members of the Armed Forces residing in 
the vicinity of Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, without 
regard to the provisions of section 3721(e) of title 31, United States 
Code.

SEC. 1082. DEFENSE BURDENSHARING.

    (a) Efforts To Increase Allied Burdensharing.--The President shall 
seek to have each nation that has cooperative military relations with 
the United States (including security agreements, basing arrangements, 
or mutual participation in multinational military organizations or 
operations) take one or more of the following actions:
            (1) For any nation in which United States military 
        personnel are assigned to permanent duty ashore, increase its 
        financial contributions to the payment of the nonpersonnel 
        costs incurred by the United States Government for stationing 
        United States military personnel in that nation, with a goal of 
        achieving by September 30, 2000, 75 percent of such costs. An 
        increase in financial contributions by any nation under this 
        paragraph may include the elimination of taxes, fees, or other 
        charges levied on United States military personnel, equipment, 
        or facilities stationed in that nation.
            (2) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for national 
        defense as a percentage of its gross domestic product by 10 
        percent or at least to a level commensurate to that of the 
        United States by September 30, 1998.
            (3) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for foreign 
        assistance (to promote democratization, economic stabilization, 
        transparency arrangements, defense economic conversion, respect 
        for the rule of law, and internationally recognized human 
        rights) by 10 percent or at least to a level commensurate to 
        that of the United States by September 30, 1998.
            (4) Increase the amount of military assets (including 
        personnel, equipment, logistics, support and other resources) 
        that it contributes, or would be prepared to contribute, to 
        multinational military activities worldwide.
    (b) Authorities To Encourage Actions by United States Allies.--In 
seeking the actions described in subsection (a) with respect to any 
nation, or in response to a failure by any nation to undertake one or 
more of such actions, the President may take any of the following 
measures to the extent otherwise authorized by law:
            (1) Reduce the end strength level of members of the Armed 
        Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore in that nation.
            (2) Impose on that nation fees or other charges similar to 
        those that such nation imposes on United States forces 
        stationed in that nation.
            (3) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment, or other 
        appropriate procedures as authorized by law) the amount the 
        United States contributes to the NATO Civil Budget, Military 
        Budget, or Security Investment Program.
            (4) Suspend, modify, or terminate any bilateral security 
        agreement the United States has with that nation, consistent 
        with the terms of such agreement.
            (5) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment or other 
        appropriate procedures as authorized by law) any United States 
        bilateral assistance appropriated for that nation.
            (6) Take any other action the President determines to be 
        appropriate as authorized by law.
    (c) Report on Progress in Increasing Allied Burdensharing.--Not 
later than March 1, 1998, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
Congress a report on--
            (1) steps taken by other nations to complete the actions 
        described in subsection (a);
            (2) all measures taken by the President, including those 
        authorized in subsection (b), to achieve the actions described 
        in subsection (a);
            (3) the difference between the amount allocated by other 
        nations for each of the actions described in subsection (a) 
        during the period beginning on March 1, 1996, and ending on 
        February 28, 1997, and during the period beginning on March 1, 
        1997, and ending on February 28, 1998; and
            (4) the budgetary savings to the United States that are 
        expected to accrue as a result of the steps described under 
        paragraph (1).
    (d) Report on National Security Bases for Forward Deployment and 
Burdensharing Relationships.--(1) In order to ensure the best 
allocation of budgetary resources, the President shall undertake a 
review of the status of elements of the United States Armed Forces that 
are permanently stationed outside the United States. The review shall 
include an assessment of the following:
            (A) The alliance requirements that are to be found in 
        agreements between the United States and other countries.
            (B) The national security interests that support 
        permanently stationing elements of the United States Armed 
        Forces outside the United States.
            (C) The stationing costs associated with the forward 
        deployment of elements of the United States Armed Forces.
            (D) The alternatives available to forward deployment (such 
        as material prepositioning, enhanced airlift and sealift, or 
        joint training operations) to meet such alliance requirements 
        or national security interests, with such alternatives 
        identified and described in detail.
            (E) The costs and force structure configurations associated 
        with such alternatives to forward deployment.
            (F) The financial contributions that allies of the United 
        States make to common defense efforts (to promote 
        democratization, economic stabilization, transparency 
        arrangements, defense economic conversion, respect for the rule 
        of law, and internationally recognized human rights).
            (G) The contributions that allies of the United States make 
        to meeting the stationing costs associated with the forward 
        deployment of elements of the United States Armed Forces.
            (H) The annual expenditures of the United States and its 
        allies on national defense, and the relative percentages of 
        each nation's gross domestic product constituted by those 
        expenditures.
    (2) The President shall submit to Congress a report on the review 
under paragraph (1). The report shall be submitted not later than March 
1, 1998, in classified and unclassified form.

SEC. 1083. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A FOLLOW-ON FORCE FOR BOSNIA.

    (a) The Senate finds the following:
            (1) United States military forces were deployed to Bosnia 
        as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        Implementation Forces (IFOR) to implement the military aspects 
        of the Dayton Agreement.
            (2) The military aspects of the Dayton Agreement were being 
        successfully implemented.
            (3) Following the recommendation of the Secretary General 
        of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on December 11, 1996, 
        to extend the presence of NATO forces in Bosnia until June 1998 
        so that progress could be achieved in implementing the civil 
        aspects of the Dayton Agreement, the President announced his 
        decision to extend the presence of United States forces in 
        Bosnia to participate in the NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) 
        until June 1998.
            (4) The cost of United States participation in operations 
        in Bosnia from 1992 through June 1998 is estimated to exceed 
        $7,000,000,000.
            (5) The President and the Secretary of Defense have stated 
        that United States forces are to be withdrawn from Bosnia by 
        June 1998.
    (b) It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) United States ground combat forces should not 
        participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
        after June 1998;
            (2) the European Security and Defense Identity, which, as 
        facilitated by the Combined Joint Task Forces concept, enables 
        the Western European Union, with the consent of the North 
        Atlantic Alliance, to assume political control and strategic 
        direction of NATO assets made available by the Alliance, is an 
        ideal instrument for a follow-on force for Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina;
            (3) if the European Security and Defense Identity is not 
        sufficiently developed or is otherwise deemed inappropriate for 
        such a mission, a NATO-led force without the participation of 
        United States ground combat forces in Bosnia, may be suitable 
        for a follow-on force for Bosnia and Herzegovina;
            (4) the United States may decide to appropriately provide 
        support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on 
        force, including command and control, intelligence, logistics, 
        and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in the region;
            (5) the President should inform our European NATO allies of 
        this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly 
        urge them to undertake preparations for a Western European 
        Union-led or NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-
        led Stabilization Force if needed to maintain peace and 
        stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and
            (6) the President should consult with the Congress with 
        respect to any support to be provided to a Western European 
        Union-led or NATO-led follow-on force in Bosnia after June 
        1998.

SEC. 1084. ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS REGARDING THE SAFETY, 
              SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED STATES NUCLEAR 
              WEAPONS STOCKPILE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on 
        earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on 
        nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using 
        weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of the 
        nuclear stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility as a 
        deterrent.
            (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the 
        Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
            (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States 
        is prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water 
        Development Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-377; 42 
        U.S.C. 2121 note) from conducting underground nuclear tests 
        ``unless a foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this 
        date, at which time the prohibition on United States nuclear 
        testing is lifted''.
            (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note) 
        requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and support a 
        program to assure that the United States is in a position to 
        maintain the reliability, safety, and continued deterrent 
        effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in 
        the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban on 
        nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and ratified.''.
            (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 
        note) requires the President to submit an annual report to 
        Congress which sets forth ``any concerns with respect to the 
        safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing 
        United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile 
        Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy''.
            (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to 
        assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under a 
        test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our 
        confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of 
        our weapons''. This decision was codified in a Presidential 
        Directive.
            (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 1994 also requires that the Secretary of Energy 
        establish a ``stewardship program to ensure the preservation of 
        the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United 
        States in nuclear weapons''.
            (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the 
        safety and reliability of the United States nuclear stockpile 
        is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. 
        The ability of the United States to maintain warheads without 
        testing will require development of new and sophisticated 
        diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current 
        diagnostic technologies and laboratory testing techniques are 
        insufficient to certify the future safety and reliability of 
        the United States nuclear stockpile. In the past these 
        laboratory and diagnostic tools were used in conjunction with 
        nuclear testing.
            (9) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the 
        establishment of a new annual reporting and certification 
        requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe 
        and reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.
            (10) On the same day, the President noted that the 
        Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the 
        responsibility, after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons 
        Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, 
        and the Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to 
        provide the President with the information to make the 
        certification referred to in paragraph (9).
            (11) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by 
        section 179 of title 10, United States Code, is responsible for 
        providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of 
        Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including 
        ``considering safety, security, and control issues for existing 
        weapons''. The Council plays a critical role in advising 
        Congress in matters relating to nuclear weapons.
            (12) It is essential that the President receive well-
        informed, objective, and honest opinions from his advisors and 
        technical experts regarding the safety, security, and 
        reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.
    (b) Policy.--
            (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States--
                    (A) to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable 
                nuclear weapons stockpile; and
                    (B) as long as other nations covet or control 
                nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, 
                to retain a credible nuclear deterrent.
            (2) Nuclear weapons stockpile.--It is in the security 
        interest of the United States to sustain the United States 
        nuclear weapons stockpile through programs relating to 
        stockpile stewardship, subcritical experiments, maintenance of 
        the weapons laboratories, and protection of the infrastructure 
        of the weapons complex.
            (3) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) the United States should retain a triad of 
                strategic nuclear forces sufficient to deter any future 
                hostile foreign leadership with access to strategic 
                nuclear forces from acting against our vital interests;
                    (B) the United States should continue to maintain 
                nuclear forces of sufficient size and capability to 
                hold at risk a broad range of assets valued by such 
                political and military leaders; and
                    (C) the advice of the persons required to provide 
                the President and Congress with assurances of the 
                safety, security and reliability of the nuclear weapons 
                force should be scientifically based, without regard 
                for politics, and of the highest quality and integrity.
    (c) Advice and Opinions Regarding Nuclear Weapons Stockpile.--Any 
director of a nuclear weapons laboratory or member of the Joint Nuclear 
Weapons Council, or the Commander of United States Strategic Command, 
may submit to the President or Congress advice or opinion in 
disagreement with, or in addition to, the advice presented by the 
Secretary of Energy or Secretary of Defense to the President, the 
National Security Council, or Congress, as the case may be, regarding 
the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.
    (d) Expression of Individual Views.--A representative of the 
President may not take any action against, or otherwise constrain, a 
director of a nuclear weapons laboratory, a member of the Joint Nuclear 
Weapons Council, or the Commander of United States Strategic Command 
for presenting individual views to the President, the National Security 
Council, or Congress regarding the safety, security, and reliability of 
the nuclear weapons stockpile.
    (e) Definitions.--
            (1) Representative of the president.--The term 
        ``representative of the President'' means the following:

        capacity to quantify the actual costs and savings attributable 
        to the closure and realignment of military installations 
        pursuant to the base closure process; and
            (2) the Secretary should develop the system in expedient 
        fashion, so that the system may be used to quantify costs and 
        savings attributable to the 1995 base closure round.

SEC. 2833. SENSE OF SENATE ON UTILIZATION OF SAVINGS DERIVED FROM BASE 
              CLOSURE PROCESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since 1988, the Department of Defense has conducted 4 
        rounds of closures and realignments of military installations 
        in the United States, resulting in the closure of 97 
        installations.
            (2) The cost of carrying out the closure or realignment of 
        installations covered by such rounds is estimated by the 
        Secretary of Defense to be $23,000,000,000.
            (3) The savings expected as a result of the closure or 
        realignment of such installations are estimated by the 
        Secretary to be $10,300,000,000 through fiscal year 1996 and 
        $36,600,000,000 through 2001.
            (4) In addition to such savings, the Secretary has 
        estimated recurring savings as a result of the closure or 
        realignment of such installations of approximately 
        $5,600,000,000 annually.
            (5) The fiscal year 1997 budget request for the Department 
        assumes a savings of between $2,000,000,000 and $3,000,000,000 
        as a result of the closure or realignment of such 
        installations, which savings were to be dedicated to 
        modernization of the Armed Forces. The savings assumed in the 
        budget request were not realized.
            (6) The fiscal year 1998 budget request for the Department 
        assumes a savings of $5,000,000,000 as a result of the closure 
        or realignment of such installations, which savings are to be 
        dedicated to modernization of the Armed Forces.
    (b) Sense of Senate on Use of Savings Resulting from Base Closure 
Process.--It is the sense of the Senate that the savings identified in 
the report under section 2832 should be made available to the 
Department of Defense solely for purposes of modernization of new 
weapon systems (including research, development, test, and evaluation 
relating to such modernization) and should be used by the Department 
solely for such purposes.

SEC. 3601. COMMENDING MEXICO ON FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.

    (a) Congress finds that--
            (1) on July 6, 1997, elections were conducted in Mexico in 
        order to fill 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 32 seats in 
        the 128 seat Senate, the office of the Mayor of Mexico City, 
        and local elections in a number of Mexican States;
            (2) for the first time, the federal elections were 
        organized by the Federal Electoral Institute, an autonomous and 
        independent organization established under the Mexican 
        Constitution;
            (3) more than 52 million Mexican citizens registered to 
        vote;
            (4) eight political parties registered to participate in 
        the July 6, elections, including the Institutional 
        Revolutionary Party (PRI), the National Action Party (PAN), and 
        the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD);
            (5) since 1993, Mexican citizens have had the exclusive 
        right to participate as observers in activities related to the 
        preparation and the conduct of elections;
            (6) since 1994, Mexican law has permitted international 
        observers to be a part of the process;
            (7) with 84 percent of the ballots counted, PRI candidates 
        received 38 percent of the vote for seats in the Chamber of 
        Deputies; while PRD and PAN candidates received 52 percent of 
        the combined vote;
            (8) PRD candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano has become 
        the first elected Mayor of Mexico City, a post previously 
        appointed by the President; and
            (9) PAN members will now serve as governors in seven of 
        Mexico's 31 States.
    (b) It is the Sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the recent Mexican elections were conducted in a free, 
        fair and impartial manner;
            (2) the will of the Mexican people, as expressed through 
        the ballot box, has been respected by President Ernesto Zedillo 
        and officials throughout his administration; and
            (3) President Zedillo, the Mexican Government, the Federal 
        Electoral Institute, the political parties and candidates, and 
        most importantly the citizens of Mexico should all be 
        congratulated for their support and participation in these very 
        historic elections.

SEC. 3602. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CAMBODIA.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) during the 1970's and 1980's Cambodia was wracked by 
        political conflict, war and violence, including genocide 
        perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979;
            (2) the 1991 Paris Agreements on a Comprehensive Political 
        Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict set the stage for a process 
        of political accommodation and national reconciliation among 
        Cambodia's warring parties;
            (3) the international community engaged in a massive, more 
        than $2,000,000,000 effort to ensure peace, democracy and 
        prosperity in Cambodia following the Paris Accords;
            (4) the Cambodian people clearly demonstrated their support 
        for democracy when 90 percent of eligible Cambodian voters 
        participated in United Nations-sponsored elections in 1993;
            (5) since the 1993 elections, Cambodia has made economic 
        progress, as evidenced by the decision last month of the 
        Association of Southeast Asian Nations to extend membership to 
        Cambodia;
            (6) tensions within the ruling Cambodian coalition have 
        erupted into violence in recent months as both parties solicit 
        support from former Khmer Rouge elements, which had been 
        increasingly marginalized in Cambodian politics;
            (7) in March, 19 Cambodians were killed and more than 100 
        were wounded in a grenade attack on political demonstrators 
        supportive of the Funcinpec and the Khmer Nation Party;
            (8) during June fighting erupted in Phnom Penh between 
        forces loyal to First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh and 
        second Prime Minister Hun Sen;
            (9) on July 5, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen deposed the 
        First Prime Minister in a violent coup d'etat;
            (10) forces loyal to Hun Sen have executed former Interior 
        Minister Ho Sok, and targeted other political opponents loyal 
        to Prince Ranariddh;
            (11) democracy and stability in Cambodia are threatened by 
        the continued use of violence to resolve political tensions;
            (12) the Administration has suspended assistance for one 
        month in response to the deteriorating situation in Cambodia;
            (13) the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has decided 
        to delay indefinitely Cambodian membership.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the parties should immediately cease the use of 
        violence in Cambodia;
            (2) the United States should take all necessary steps to 
        ensure the safety of American citizens in Cambodia;
            (3) the United States should call an emergency meeting of 
        the United Nations Security Council to consider all options to 
        restore peace in Cambodia;
            (4) the United States and ASEAN should work together to 
        take immediate steps to restore democracy and the rule of law 
        in Cambodia;
            (5) United States assistance to the government of Cambodia 
        should remain suspended until violence ends, the democratically 
        elected government is restored to power, and the necessary 
        steps have been taken to ensure that the elections scheduled 
        for 1998 take place;
            (6) the United States should take all necessary steps to 
        encourage other donor nations to suspend assistance as part of 
        a multilateral effort.

SEC. 3603. CONGRATULATING GOVERNOR CHRISTOPHER PATTEN OF HONG KONG.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) His Excellency Christopher F. Patten, the now former 
        Governor of Hong Kong, was the twenty-eighth British Governor 
        to preside over Hong Kong, prior to that territory reverting 
        back to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997;
            (2) Chris Patten was a superb administrator and an 
        inspiration to the people who he sought to govern;
            (3) during his five years as Governor of Hong Kong, the 
        economy flourished under his stewardship, growing by more than 
        30 percent in real terms;
            (4) Chris Patten presided over a capable and honest civil 
        service;
            (5) common crime declined during his tenure, and the 
        political climate was positive and stable;
            (6) Chris Patten's legacy to Hong Kong is the expansion of 
        democracy in Hong Kong's legislative council and a tireless 
        devotion to the rights, freedoms and welfare of Hong Kong's 
        people; and
            (7) Chris Patten fulfilled the British commitment to ``put 
        in place a solidly based democratic administration'' in Hong 
        Kong prior to July 1, 1997.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) Governor Chris Patten has served his country with great 
        honor and distinction; and
            (2) he deserves special thanks and recognition from the 
        United States for his tireless efforts to develop and nurture 
        democracy in Hong Kong.

            Passed the Senate July 11, 1997.
