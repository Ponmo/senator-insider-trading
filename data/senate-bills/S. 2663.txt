such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or her 
behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging such discharge 
or discrimination and identifying the person responsible for such act. 
Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify, in 
writing, the person named in the complaint of the filing of the 
complaint, of the allegations contained in the complaint, of the 
substance of evidence supporting the complaint, and of the 
opportunities that will be afforded to such person under paragraph (2).

complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after affording the complainant 
and the person named in the complaint an opportunity to submit to the 
Secretary a written response to the complaint and an opportunity to 
meet with a representative of the Secretary to present statements from 
witnesses, the Secretary shall initiate an investigation and determine 
whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has 
merit and notify, in writing, the complainant and the person alleged to 
have committed a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary's 
findings. If the Secretary concludes that there is reasonable cause to 
believe that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary 
shall accompany the Secretary's findings with a preliminary order 
providing the relief prescribed by paragraph (3)(B). Not later than 30 
days after the date of notification of findings under this paragraph, 
either the person alleged to have committed the violation or the 
complainant may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, 
or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of such 
objections shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy contained 
in the preliminary order. Any such hearing shall be conducted 
expeditiously. If a hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the 
preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject to 
judicial review.

subsection and shall not conduct an investigation otherwise required 
under subparagraph (A) unless the complainant makes a prima facie 
showing that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of 
subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel 
action alleged in the complaint.
    ``(ii) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the 
complainant has made the showing required under clause (i), no 
investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) shall be 
conducted if the employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing 
evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable 
personnel action in the absence of that behavior.
    ``(iii) The Secretary may determine that a violation of subsection 
(a) has occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that any behavior 
described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a 
contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the 
complaint.

employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the 
employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the 
absence of that behavior.

any hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall issue a final 
order providing the relief prescribed by this paragraph or denying the 
complaint. At any time before issuance of a final order, a proceeding 
under this subsection may be terminated on the basis of a settlement 
agreement entered into by the Secretary, the complainant, and the 
person alleged to have committed the violation.
    ``(B) If, in response to a complaint filed under paragraph (1), the 
Secretary determines that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, 
the Secretary shall order the person who committed such violation--

            ``(ii) to reinstate the complainant to his or her former 
        position together with compensation (including back pay) and 
        restore the terms, conditions, and privileges associated with 
        his or her employment; and

request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against 
whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all 
costs and expenses (including attorneys' and expert witness fees) 
reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary, by the complainant 
for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint upon which 
the order was issued.
    ``(C) If the Secretary finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) 
is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary may award 
to the prevailing employer a reasonable attorneys' fee, not exceeding 
$1,000, to be paid by the complainant.
    ``(4) If the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 210 
days after the filing of the complaint, or within 90 days after 
receiving a written determination, the complainant may bring an action 
at law or equity for review in the appropriate district court of the 
United States with jurisdiction, which shall have jurisdiction over 
such an action without regard to the amount in controversy, and which 
action shall, at the request of either party to such action, be tried 
by the court with a jury. The proceedings shall be governed by the same 
legal burdens of proof specified in paragraph (2)(B). The court shall 
have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief to the employee 
available by law or equity, including injunctive relief, compensatory 
and consequential damages, reasonable attorneys and expert witness 
fees, court costs, and punitive damages up to $250,000.
    ``(5)(A) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final 
order issued under paragraph (3) may obtain review of the order in the 
United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation, 
with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred or the 
circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of such violation. 
The petition for review must be filed not later than 60 days after the 
date of the issuance of the final order of the Secretary. Review shall 
conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The commencement 
of proceedings under this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the 
court, operate as a stay of the order.
    ``(B) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review could 
have been obtained under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to 
judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.
    ``(6) Whenever any person has failed to comply with an order issued 
under paragraph (3), the Secretary may file a civil action in the 
United States district court for the district in which the violation 
was found to occur, or in the United States district court for the 
District of Columbia, to enforce such order. In actions brought under

SEC. 22. BAN ON CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS CONTAINING LEAD; LEAD PAINT RULE.

    (a) In General.--Beginning on the date that is 1 year after the 
date of enactment of this Act, any children's product (as defined in 
section 14(e) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2063(e))) 
that contains lead shall be treated as a banned hazardous substance 
under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.).
    (b) Trace Amounts of Lead.--
            (1) Initial standard.--For purposes of subsection (a), a 
        children's product shall be considered to contain lead if any 
        part of the product contains lead or lead compounds and the 
        lead content of such part (calculated as lead metal) is greater 
        than 0.03 percent by weight of the total weight of such part 
        (or such lesser amount as may be established by the Commission 
        by regulation).
            (2) Reduced threshold.--
                    (A) In general.--Beginning on the date that is 3 
                years after the date of enactment of this Act, 
                paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``0.01 
                percent'' for ``0.03 percent'' unless the Consumer 
                Product Safety Commission determines that a standard of 
                0.01 percent is not technologically feasible. The 
                Commission may make such a determination only after 
                notice and a hearing and after analyzing the public 
                health protections associated with substantially 
                reducing lead in children's products.
                    (B) Alternative reduction.--If the Commission 
                determines under subparagraph (A) that the 0.01 percent 
                standard is not technologically feasible, the 
                Commission shall, by regulation, establish a lesser 
                amount that is the lowest amount of lead, lower than 
                0.03 percent by weight, the Commission determines to be 
                technologically feasible to achieve. The amount of lead 
                established by the Commission under the preceding 
                sentence shall be substituted for the 0.03 percent 
                standard under paragraph (1) beginning on the date that 
                is 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.
    (c) Exceptions.--
            (1) Inaccessible components.--After notice and a hearing, 
        the Commission may determine that subsection (a) does not apply 
        to a component of a children's product that is not accessible 
        to a child because it is not physically exposed by reason of a 
        sealed covering or casing and will not become physically 
        exposed through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse 
        of the product. In making its determination under this 
        paragraph, the Commission may not consider paint, coatings, or 
        electroplating to be a barrier that would render lead in the 
        substrate inaccessible to a child through normal and reasonably 
        foreseeable use and abuse of the product.
            (2) Electronics.--If the Commission determines that it is 
        not feasible for certain electronic devices, including 
        batteries, to comply with subsection (a) at the time the 
        regulations take effect, the Commission shall, by regulation--
                    (A) issue standards to reduce the exposure of and 
                accessibility to lead in such electronic devices; and
                    (B) establish a schedule by which such electronic 
                devices shall be in full compliance with the 
                regulations prescribed under subsection (a).
    (d) Regulations.--Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), 
the Commission may by regulation establish such lower thresholds for 
lead content in children's products than those set forth in subsection 
(b) as the Commission finds to be technologically feasible.
    (e) Paint Standard for All Products.--Effective on the date that is 
1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission shall modify section 1303.1 of its regulations (16 
C.F.R. 1303.1) by substituting ``0.009 percent'' for ``0.06 percent'' 
in subsection (a) of that section.
    (f) Application with ASTM F963.--To the extent that any standard or 
rule promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission under this 
section (or any section of the Consumer Product Safety Act or any other 
Act enforced by the Commission, as such Acts are affected by this 
section) is inconsistent with the ASTM F963 standard, such promulgated 
standard or rule shall supersede the ASTM F963 standard to the extent 
of the inconsistency.

SEC. 23. ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF LEAD CONTENT.

    The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the 
National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, shall study the feasibility of establishing a 
measurement standard based on a units-of-mass-per-area standard 
(similar to existing measurement standards used by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency 
to measure for metals in household paint and soil, respectively) that 
is statistically comparable to the parts-per-million measurement 
standard currently used in laboratory analysis.

SEC. 24. STUDY OF PREVENTABLE INJURIES AND DEATHS OF MINORITY CHILDREN 
              RELATED TO CERTAIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

    (a) In General.--Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Government Accountability Office shall initiate a study to 
assess disparities in the risks and incidence of preventable injuries 
and deaths among children of minority populations, including Black, 
Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander 
children in the United States.
    (b) Requirements.--The study shall examine the racial disparities 
of the rates of preventable injuries and deaths related to suffocation, 
poisonings, and drowning including those associated with the use of 
cribs, mattresses and bedding materials, swimming pools and spas, and 
toys and other products intended for use by children.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Commission shall report its findings to the Senate 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the House of 
Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee. The report shall 
include--
            (1) the Commission's findings on the incidence of 
        preventable risks of injury and death among children of 
        minority populations and recommendations for minimizing such 
        increased risks;
            (2) recommendations for public outreach, awareness, and 
        prevention campaigns specifically aimed at racial minority 
        populations; and
            (3) recommendations for education initiatives that may 
        reduce current statistical disparities.
    (d) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated to the 
Commission $500,000 for purposes of carrying out this section for 
fiscal year 2009.

              ACT OF 1970.

    Section 3 of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 
1472) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:
    ``(e) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to require the 
Secretary, in establishing a standard under this section, to prepare a 
comparison of the costs that would be incurred in complying with such 
standard with the benefits of such standard.''.
