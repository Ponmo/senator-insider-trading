SEC. 203. MECHANISM FOR IMPLEMENTING INCREASE OF FISCAL YEAR 2002 
              DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
        (1) Unless and until the discretionary spending limit for 
    fiscal year 2002 (as set out in section 251(c) of the Balanced 
    Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985) is increased, 
    aggregate appropriations which exceed the current law limits would 
    still be out of order in the Senate and subject to a supermajority 
    vote.
        (2) Except for a necessary adjustment included in function 920 
    (to comply with section 312(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
    1974), the functional totals contained in this concurrent 
    resolution envision a level of discretionary spending for fiscal 
    year 2002 as follows:
            (A) For the discretionary category: $659,540,000,000 in new 
        budget authority and $647,780,000,000 in outlays.
            (B) For the highway category: $28,489,000,000 in outlays.
            (C) For the mass transit category: $5,275,000,000 in 
        outlays.
            (D) For the conservation category: $1,760,000,000 in new 
        budget authority and $1,232,000,000 in outlays.
        (3) To facilitate the Senate completing its legislative 
    responsibilities for the 1st Session of the 107th Congress in a 
    timely fashion, it is imperative that the Senate consider 
    legislation which establishes appropriate discretionary spending 
    limits for fiscal year 2002 through 2006 as soon as possible.
    (b) Adjustment to Allocations and Other Budgetary Aggregates and 
Levels.--Whenever a bill or joint resolution becomes law that increases 
the discretionary spending limit for fiscal year 2002 set out in 
section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate 
shall increase the allocation called for in section 302(a) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(a)) to the appropriate 
Committee on Appropriations and shall also appropriately adjust all 
other budgetary aggregates and levels contained in this resolution.
    (c) Senate Defense Firewall.--

         TITLE III--SENSE OF THE SENATE AND CONGRESS PROVISIONS
                    Subtitle A--Sense of the Senate

SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CONSERVATION.

    It is the sense of the Senate that conservation funding is a 
priority of the One Hundred Seventh Congress.

SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON AIDS AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, it is the 
sense of the Senate that:
        (1) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (A) HIV/AIDS, having already infected over 58 million 
        people worldwide, is devastating the health, economies, and 
        social structures in dozens of countries in Africa, and 
        increasingly in Asia, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe.
            (B) AIDS has wiped out decades of progress in improving the 
        lives of families in the developing world. As the leading cause 
        of death in Africa, AIDS has killed 17 million and will claim 
        the lives of one quarter of the population, mostly productive 
        adults, in the next decade. In addition, 13 million children 
        have been orphaned by AIDS--a number that will rise to 40 
        million by 2010.
            (C) The Agency for International Development, along with 
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of 
        Labor, and Department of Defense have been at the forefront of 
        the international battle to control HIV/AIDS, with global 
        assistance totaling $330,000,000 from the United States Agency 
        for International Development and $136,000,000 from other 
        agencies in fiscal year 2001, primarily focused on targeted 
        prevention programs.
            (D) While prevention is key, treatment and care for those 
        affected by HIV/AIDS is an increasingly critical component of 
        the global response. Improving health systems, providing home-
        based care, treating AIDS-associated diseases like 
        tuberculosis, providing for family support and orphan care, and 
        making antiretroviral drugs against HIV available will reduce 
        social and economic damage to families and communities.
            (E) Pharmaceutical companies recently dramatically reduced 
        the prices of antiretroviral drugs to the poorest countries. 
        With sufficient resources, it is now possible to improve 
        treatment options in countries where health systems are able to 
        deliver and monitor the medications.
            (F) The United Nations AIDS program estimates it will cost 
        at least $3,000,000,000 for basic AIDS prevention and care 
        services in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, and at least 
        $2,000,000,000 more if antiretroviral drugs are provided 
        widely. In Africa, only $500,000,000 is currently available 
        from all donors, lending agencies and African governments 
        themselves.
        (2) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
    the spending levels in this budget resolution shall be increased by 
    $200,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 and by $500,000,000 in fiscal year 
    2003 and for each year thereafter for the purpose of helping the 
    neediest countries cope with the burgeoning costs of prevention, 
    care and treatment of those affected by HIV/AIDS and associated 
    infectious diseases.

SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CONSOLIDATED HEALTH CENTERS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that appropriations for consolidated 
health centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 254b) should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal 
years in order to double the number of individuals who receive health 
services at community, migrant, homeless, and public housing health 
centers.

SEC. 304. FUNDING FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS FOR STATE AND 
              LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this resolution 
assume increased funding for fiscal year 2002 for the Department of 
Justice, State and local law enforcement grant programs.

SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING UNITED STATES COAST GUARD 
              FISCAL YEAR 2002 FUNDING.

     It is the sense of the Senate that any level of budget authority 
and outlays in fiscal year 2002 below the level assumed in this 
resolution for the Coast Guard would require the Coast Guard to--
        (1) close numerous units and reduce overall mission capability, 
    including the counter narcotics interdiction mission which was 
    authorized under the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act;
        (2) reduce the number of personnel of an already streamlined 
    workforce; and
        (3) reduce operations in a manner that would have a detrimental 
    impact on the sustainability of valuable fish stocks in the North 
    Atlantic and Pacific Northwest and its capacity to stem the flow of 
    illicit drugs and illegal immigration into the United States.

SEC. 306. STRENGTHENING OUR NATIONAL FOOD SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE.

    (a) Finding.--The Senate finds that the United States food supply 
is one of the safest in the world, but in order to maintain the 
integrity of our food supply in the face of emerging threats, we must 
make the necessary investments now, in a time of surplus.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
levels in this resolution assume that the appropriate amount should be 
invested at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention food activities next year in order to 
strengthen our national food safety infrastructure by--
        (1) increasing the number of inspectors within the Food and 
    Drug Administration to enable the Food and Drug Administration to 
    inspect high-risk sites at least annually;
        (2) supporting research that enables us to meet emerging 
    threats;
        (3) improving surveillance to identify and trace the sources 
    and incidence of food-borne illness;
        (4) otherwise maintaining at least current funding levels for 
    food safety initiatives in the Food and Drug Administration and the 
    United States Department of Agriculture; and
        (5) providing additional funds should such needs arise due to 
    emerging food safety threats.

SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO INCREASING FUNDS FOR 
              RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate recognizes the 
importance of renewable energy resources and that providing for such 
technologies should be increased by at least $450,000,000 for fiscal 
year 2002 and at a rate in excess of inflation in subsequent years.

SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO INCREASED EDUCATION 
              FUNDING.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
        (1) this budget resolution makes available up to $6.2 billion 
    in discretionary budget authority for funding domestic priorities 
    in excess of the President's request;
        (2) funding for discretionary education programs (including 
    Head Start and funds for the Department of Education in excess of 
    the President's request of $44.5 billion in discretionary budget 
    authority for fiscal year 2002) is one such priority; and
        (3) these additional funds for education should be devoted to 
    high priority programs including Head Start, the Individuals with 
    Disabilities Education Act, education for the disadvantaged, Impact 
    Aid, State assessment tests, Pell Grants, reading improvement 
    programs, school construction, and teacher and classroom quality 
    programs.

                   Subtitle B--Sense of the Congress

SEC. 311. ASSET BUILDING FOR THE WORKING POOR.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) For the vast majority of United States households, the 
    pathway to the economic mainstream and financial security is not 
    through spending and consumption, but through savings, investing, 
    and the accumulation of assets.
        (2) One-third of all Americans have no assets available for 
    investment and another 20 percent have only negligible assets. The 
    situation is even more serious for minority households; for 
    example, 60 percent of African-American households have no or 
    negative financial assets.
        (3) Nearly 50 percent of all children in America live in 
    households that have no assets available for investment, including 
    40 percent of Caucasian children and 73 percent of African-American 
    children.
        (4) Up to 20 percent of all United States households do not 
    deposit their savings in financial institutions and, thus, do not 
    have access to the basic financial tools that make asset 
    accumulation possible.
        (5) Public policy can have either a positive or a negative 
    impact on asset accumulation. Traditional public assistance 
    programs based on income and consumption have rarely been 
    successful in supporting the transition to economic self-
    sufficiency. Tax policy, through $288,000,000,000 in annual tax 
    incentives, has helped lay the foundation for the great middle 
    class.
        (6) Lacking an income tax liability, low-income working 
    families cannot take advantage of asset development incentives 
    available through the Federal tax code.
        (7) Individual Development Accounts have proven to be 
    successful in helping low-income working families save and 
    accumulate assets. Individual Development Accounts have been used 
    to purchase long-term, high-return assets, including homes, 
    postsecondary education and training, and small business.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Federal tax code should support a significant expansion of Individual 
Development Accounts so that millions of low-income, working families 
can save, build assets, and move their lives forward; thus, making 
positive contributions to the economic and social well-being of the 
United States, as well as to its future.

SEC. 312. FEDERAL FIRE PREVENTION ASSISTANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) Increased demands on firefighting and emergency medical 
    personnel have made it difficult for local governments to 
    adequately fund necessary fire safety precautions.
        (2) The Government has an obligation to protect the health and 
    safety of the firefighting personnel of the United States and to 
    ensure that they have the financial resources to protect the 
    public.
        (3) The high rates in the United States of death, injury, and 
    property damage caused by fires demonstrates a critical need for 
    Federal investment in support of firefighting personnel.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Government should support the core operations of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency by providing needed fire grant programs to assist our 
firefighters and rescue personnel as they respond to more than 
17,000,000 emergency calls annually. To accomplish this task, Congress 
supports preservation of the Assistance to Firefighters grant program. 
Continued support of the Assistance to Firefighters grant program will 
enable local firefighters to adequately protect the lives of countless 
Americans put at risk by insufficient fire protection.

SEC. 313. FUNDING FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AT CHILDREN'S TEACHING 
              HOSPITALS.

    It is the sense of Congress that:
        (1) Function 550 includes an appropriate level of funding for 
    graduate medical education conducted at independent children's 
    teaching hospitals in order to ensure access to care by millions of 
    children nationwide.
        (2) An emphasis should be placed on the role played by 
    community health centers in underserved rural and urban 
    communities.
        (3) Funding under function 550 should also reflect the 
    importance of the Ryan White CARE Act to persons afflicted with 
    HIV/AIDS.

SEC. 314. CONCURRENT RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY BENEFITS TO RETIRED 
              MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the Secretary of Defense is the 
appropriate official for evaluating the existing standards for the 
provision of concurrent retirement and disability benefits to retired 
members of the Armed Forces and the need to change these standards.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the Secretary of Defense should report not later than 180 
    days after the date of adoption of this resolution to the 
    congressional committees of jurisdiction on the provision of 
    concurrent retirement and disability benefits to retired members of 
    the Armed Forces;
        (2) the report should address the number of individuals retired 
    from the Armed Forces who would otherwise be eligible for 
    disability compensation, the comparability of the policy to Office 
    of Personnel Management guidelines for civilian Federal retirees, 
    the applicability of this policy to prevailing private sector 
    standards, the number of individuals potentially eligible for 
    concurrent benefits who receive other forms of Federal assistance 
    and the cost of that assistance, and alternative initiatives that 
    would accomplish the same end as concurrent receipt of military 
    retired pay and disability compensation;
        (3) the Secretary of Defense should submit legislation that he 
    considers appropriate;
        (4) upon receiving such report, the committees of jurisdiction, 
    working with the Committees on the Budget of the House of 
    Representatives and the Senate, should consider appropriate 
    legislation; and
        (5) the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of 
    Management and Budget should report not later than 30 days after 
    the date of adoption of this resolution to the Committees on the 
    Budget on the risk that provision of full concurrent receipt of 
    military retired pay and disability compensation would reduce the 
    surplus below the level of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust 
    Fund.

SEC. 315. FEDERAL EMPLOYEE PAY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) Members of the uniformed services and civilian employees of 
    the United States make significant contributions to the general 
    welfare of the Nation.
        (2) Increases in the pay of members of the uniformed services 
    and of civilian employees of the United States have not kept pace 
    with increases in the overall pay levels of workers in the private 
    sector, so that there now exists--
            (A) a 32 percent gap between compensation levels of Federal 
        civilian employees and compensation levels of private sector 
        workers; and
            (B) an estimated 10 percent gap between compensation levels 
        of members of the uniformed services and compensation levels of 
        private sector workers.
        (3) The President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2002 
    includes a 4.6 percent pay raise for military personnel.
        (4) The Office of Management and Budget has requested that 
    Federal agencies plan their fiscal year 2002 budgets with a 3.6 
    percent pay raise for civilian Federal employees.
        (5) In almost every year during the past 2 decades, there have 
    been equal adjustments in the compensation of members of the 
    uniformed services and the compensation of civilian employees of 
    the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that rates of 
compensation for civilian employees of the United States should be 
adjusted at the same time, and in the same proportion, as are rates of 
compensation for members of the uniformed services.

SEC. 316. SALES TAX DEDUCTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
        (1) in 1986 the ability to deduct State sales taxes was 
    eliminated from the Federal tax code;
        (2) the States of Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming, Washington, 
    Florida, Nevada, and South Dakota have no State income tax;
        (3) the citizens of those seven States continue to be treated 
    unfairly by paying significantly more in taxes to the Government 
    than taxpayers with an identical profile in different States 
    because they are prohibited from deducting their State sales taxes 
    from their Federal income taxes in lieu of a State income tax;
        (4) the design of the Federal tax code is preferential in its 
    treatment of States with State income taxes over those without 
    State income taxes;
        (5) the current Federal tax code infringes upon States' rights 
    to tax their citizens as they see fit in that the Federal tax code 
    exerts unjust influence on States without State income taxes to 
    impose on their citizens;
        (6) the current surpluses that our Government holds provide an 
    appropriate time and opportunity to allow taxpayers to deduct 
    either their State sales taxes or their State income taxes from 
    their Federal income tax returns; and
        (7) over 50 Members of the House of Representatives have 
    cosponsored legislation to restore the sales tax deduction option 
    to the Federal tax code.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Finance should 
consider legislation that makes State sales tax deductible against 
Federal income taxes.
