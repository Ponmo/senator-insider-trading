                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           February 13, 1997

  Mr. Specter (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. 
  Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, and Mr. 
  Grams) submitted the following resolution which was considered and 
                               agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the need to address 
                immediately the decline in milk prices.

Whereas, during the last few months farm milk prices have experienced 
        substantial volatility, dropping precipitously from $15.37 per 
        hundredweight in September, 1996 to $11.34 per hundredweight in 
        December, 1996;
Whereas the price of cheese at the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, 
        Wisconsin, influences milk prices paid to farmers because of its use in 
        the Department of Agriculture's Basic Formula Price under Federal Milk 
        Marketing Orders;
Whereas less than 1 percent of the cheese produced in the United States is sold 
        on the National Cheese Exchange and the Exchange acts as a reference 
        price for as much as 95 percent of the commercial bulk cheese sales in 
        the nation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate of the United States 
that the Secretary of Agriculture should consider acting immediately 
pursuant to his legal authority to modify the Basic Formula Price for 
dairy by replacing the National Cheese Exchange as a factor to be 
considered in setting the Basic Formula Price.
