sale of government assets
 SEC. 5. (a) It is the sense of the Congress that--
 (1) from time to time the United States Government should sell assets to
 nongovernment buyers; and
 (2) the amounts realized from such asset sales will not recur on an annual
 basis and do not reduce the demand for credit.
 (b) For purposes of allocations and points of order under section 302 of
 the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the amounts
 realized from asset sales or prepayments of loans shall not be allocated
 to a committee and shall not be scored with respect to the level of budget
 authority or outlays under a committee's allocation under section 302 of
 that Act.
 (c) For purposes of reconciliation under section 310 of the Congressional
 Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the amounts realized from asset
 sales or prepayments of loans shall not be scored with respect to the level
 of budget authority, outlays, contributions, or revenues reconciled under
 a concurrent resolution on the budget.
 (d) For purposes of this section--
 (1) the terms `asset sale' and `prepayment of a loan' shall have the same
 meaning as under section 257(12) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
 Deficit Control Act of 1985; and
 (2) the terms `asset sale' and `prepayment of a loan' do not include asset
 sales mandated by law before September 18, 1987, and routine, ongoing asset
 sales and loan prepayments at levels consistent with agency operations in
 fiscal year 1986.
RESERVE FUND FOR CHILDREN
 SEC. 6. (a) In the Senate, budget authority and outlays may be allocated
 to the Senate Committee on Finance for increased funding for children,
 including funding through tax credits, if the Committee on Finance or the
 committee of conference reports funding legislation that--
 (1) will, if enacted, make funds available for that purpose; and
 (2) to the extent that the costs of such legislation are not included
 in this resolution, will not increase the deficit in this resolution for
 fiscal year 1991, and will not increase the total deficit for the period
 of fiscal years 1991 through 1995.
 (b) Upon the reporting of legislation pursuant to subsection (a), and again
 upon the submission of a conference report on such legislation (if such a
 conference report is submitted), the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget
 of the Senate may file with the Senate appropriately revised allocations under
 section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and revised functional
 levels and aggregates to carry out this section. Such revised allocations,
 functional levels, and aggregates shall be considered for the purposes of
 such Act as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates contained in
 this resolution. The Committee on Finance shall report revised allocations
 pursuant to section 302(b) of such Act for the appropriate fiscal year
 (or years) to carry out this section.
