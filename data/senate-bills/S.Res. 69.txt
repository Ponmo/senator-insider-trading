                               RESOLUTION


 
                Condemning terrorist attacks in Israel.

Whereas on January 22, 1995, a brutal and cowardly terrorist attack near 
        Netanya, Israel killed 19 Israelis and wounded dozens more;
Whereas the terrorist group ``Islamic Jihad'' claimed credit for the January 22, 
        1995, attack in a statement issued in Damascus, Syria;
Whereas on December 25, 1994, a ``Hamas'' terrorist attack in Jerusalem wounded 
        13 civilians, including 1 American citizen;
Whereas on October 19, 1994, a Hamas terrorist attack in Tel Aviv killed 22 
        Israelis and wounded 48 more;
Whereas 110 Israeli citizens have been killed and hundreds more have been 
        wounded in terrorist attacks since the Declaration of Principles was 
        signed on September 13, 1993;
Whereas the Declaration of Principles obligates the Palestinian Authority to 
        publicly condemn terrorist attacks, and to bring to justice perpetrators 
        of such acts in territories under their control;
Whereas no perpetrators of these terrorist attacks have been brought to justice 
        for their acts of violence by the Palestinian Authority;
Whereas the governments of Syria and Iran continue to provide safe haven and 
        support for terrorist groups, including Islamic Jihad and Hamas, among 
        others; and
Whereas continued acts of terrorism threaten the peace process in the Middle 
        East: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, by the Senate, That--
            (1) the terrorist attacks in Israel are condemned in the 
        strongest possible terms;
            (2) condolences are extended to the families of all those 
        killed, and hopes are expressed for the rapid and complete 
        recovery of all wounded in the January 22, 1995, attack;
            (3) Chairman Arafat should, consistent with the obligations 
        of the Declaration of Principles, publicly and forcefully 
        condemn acts of terror against Israelis, take immediate steps 
        to bring to justice those responsible for such acts, and 
        implement steps to prevent future acts of terrorism in all 
        territory under his control;
            (4) President Assad should immediately end all support for 
        terrorist groups, including safe haven, material and financial 
        support, in all territory under his control; and
            (5) the administration should undertake strong efforts to 
        end the safe haven, training, and financial and other support 
        granted terrorists by Iran, Syria and other states.
