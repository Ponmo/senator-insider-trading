                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commending the President and the special delegation to Haiti, and 
          supporting the United States Armed Forces in Haiti.

Whereas the special delegation sent to Haiti on September 17, 1994, has 
        succeeded in convincing the de facto authorities in Haiti to agree to 
        leave power;
Whereas on September 18, 1994, after an agreement was reached in Port-au-Prince 
        that day, the President ordered the present deployment of men and women 
        of the United States Armed Forces in and around Haiti;
Whereas U.S. and multilateral sanctions have imposed a heavy burden on the 
        Haitian people; and
Whereas the Congress and the people of the United States have great pride in the 
        men and women of the United States Armed forces and fully support them 
        in all their efforts overseas, including those in Haiti: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the efforts of the President in sending former 
        President Jimmy Carter, retired General Colin Powell and 
        Senator Sam Nunn to Haiti in an effort to avoid the loss of 
        American lives;
            (2) fully supports the men and women of the United States 
        Armed Forces in Haiti who are performing with professional 
        excellence and dedicated patriotism;
            (3) supports the departure from power of the de facto 
        authorities in Haiti, and Haitian efforts to achieve national 
        reconciliation, democracy, and the rule of law;
            (4) supports lifting without delay of U.S. unilateral 
        economic sanctions on Haiti, and lifting without delay of 
        economic sanctions imposed pursuant to U.N. resolutions in 
        accordance with such resolutions; and
            (5) supports a prompt and orderly withdrawal of all United 
        States Armed Forces from Haiti as soon as possible.
                                 <all>
