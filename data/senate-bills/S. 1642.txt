evaluation shall determine--

        program, and the extent to which the pilot program generated 
        competition among lenders to participate in the auctions under 
        the pilot program;

        pilot program on the ability of--

                originate loans made through the pilot program smoothly 
                and efficiently;

                through the pilot program in a timely and efficient 
                manner;
            (4) the differential impact, if any, of the auction among 
        the States, including between rural and non-rural States; and
            (5) the feasibility of using the mechanism piloted to 
        operate the other loan programs under part B of title IV of the 
        Higher Education Act of 1965.
    (b) Reports.--The Comptroller General shall--
            (1) not later than September 1, 2010, submit to the
