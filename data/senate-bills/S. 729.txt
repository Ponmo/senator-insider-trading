SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND POLICY.

    (a) Redesignations.--Sections 401 and 402 through 412 (15 U.S.C. 
2681 and 2682 through 2692) are redesignated as sections 402, and 411 
through 421, respectively.
    (b) Findings and Policy.--Title IV (15 U.S.C. 2681 et seq.) is 
amended by inserting before section 402 (as so redesignated) the 
following new section:

``SEC. 401. FINDINGS AND POLICY.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) lead poisoning is the most prevalent disease of 
        environmental origin among American children today, and 
        children under 7 years of age are at special risk because of 
        their susceptibility to the potency of lead as a neurologic 
        toxin;
            ``(2)(A) the effects of lead on children may include 
        permanent and significant neurologic and physiologic 
        impairment; and
            ``(B) additional health effects occur in adults exposed to 
        similar exposure levels;
            ``(3) because of the practical difficulties of removing 
        lead already dispersed into the environment, children and 
        adults will continue to be exposed to lead for years;
            ``(4) as a result of decades of highly dispersive uses of 
        lead in a variety of products, contamination of the environment 
        with unacceptable levels of lead is widespread; and
            ``(5) the continued manufacture, import, processing, use, 
        and disposal of some lead-containing products may cause further 
        releases of lead into the environment, and the releases 
        contribute to further environmental contamination and resultant 
        exposure to lead.
    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that further 
releases of lead into the environment should be minimized, and methods 
should be developed and implemented to reduce sources of lead that 
result in adverse human or environmental exposures.''.

SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.

    Section 402, as redesignated by section 101(a) of this Act, is 
amended--

regulations required pursuant to the Residential Lead-Based Paint 
Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (106 Stat. 3897).

SEC. 205. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING LEAD FISHING SINKERS.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) on March 9, 1994 the EPA promulgated a rule to ban the 
        manufacture and sale of lead, zinc, and brass fishing sinkers,
            (2) the proposed rule was developed in response to a Toxic 
        Substances Control Act petition requesting that EPA label, not 
        ban, lead fishing sinkers,
            (3) EPA states in the proposed rule, ``In addition, an 
        accurate number of waterbirds that could receive a lethal dose 
        of lead or zinc from fishing sinkers, or the probability of 
        consuming a lethal dose, cannot be estimated,
            (4) no one has studied the effectiveness of fishing sinkers 
        manufactured from lead-substitute materials which can cost 
        eight to ten times as much and have physical or chemical 
        limitations,
            (5) a ban on lead fishing sinkers would put small fishing 
        tackle manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage to major 
        fishing tackle manufacturers who can afford to retool and 
        produce fishing sinkers with lead-substitute materials,
            (6) a ban on home manufacturing of lead fishing sinkers 
        would affect up to 1,600,000 anglers who make their own sinkers 
        in basements and garages, and
            (7) EPA has commented that a ban on lead fishing sinkers 
        could eventually be expanded to all lead-containing fishing 
        tackle, including lures.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Administrator should finalize no rule or regulation which requires a 
nationwide prohibition of the manufacture, sale, or use of fishing 
sinkers, jigs, or lures containing lead, brass, or zinc, until such 
time as the Administrator gives priority consideration to alternative 
means of reducing the risk to waterfowl from lead fishing sinkers, 
including labeling, public education, and State or regional limits.
