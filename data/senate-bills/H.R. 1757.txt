               TITLE XVII--EUROPEAN SECURITY ACT OF 1998

SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``European Security Act of 1998''.

SEC. 1702. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Policy With Respect to NATO Enlargement.--Congress urges the 
President to outline a clear and complete strategic rationale for the 
enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and 
declares that--
        (1) Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should not be the 
    last emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe invited to 
    join NATO;
        (2) the United States should ensure that NATO continues a 
    process whereby all other emerging democracies in Central and 
    Eastern Europe that wish to join NATO will be considered for 
    membership in NATO as soon as they meet the criteria for such 
    membership;
        (3) the United States should ensure that no limitations are 
    placed on the numbers of NATO troops or types of equipment, 
    including tactical nuclear weapons, to be deployed on the territory 
    of new member states;
        (4) the United States should reject all efforts to condition 
    NATO decisions on review or approval by the United Nations Security 
    Council;
        (5) the United States should clearly delineate those NATO 
    deliberations, including but not limited to discussions on arms 
    control, further Alliance enlargement, procurement matters, and 
    strategic doctrine, that are not subject to review or discussion in 
    the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council;
        (6) the United States should work to ensure that countries 
    invited to join the Alliance are provided an immediate seat in NATO 
    discussions; and
        (7) the United States already pays more than a proportionate 
    share of the costs of the common defense of Europe and should 
    obtain, in advance, agreement on an equitable distribution of the 
    cost of NATO enlargement to ensure that the United States does not 
    continue to bear a disproportionate burden.
    (b) Policy With Respect to Negotiations With Russia.--
        (1) Implementation.--NATO enlargement should be carried out in 
    such a manner as to underscore the Alliance's defensive nature and 
    demonstrate to Russia that NATO enlargement will enhance the 
    security of all countries in Europe, including Russia. Accordingly, 
    the United States and its NATO allies should make this intention 
    clear in negotiations with Russia, including negotiations regarding 
    adaptation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty 
    of November 19, 1990.
        (2) Limitations on commitments to russia.--In seeking to 
    demonstrate to Russia NATO's defensive and security-enhancing 
    intentions, it is essential that neither fundamental United States 
    security interests in Europe nor the effectiveness and flexibility 
    of NATO as a defensive alliance be jeopardized. In particular, no 
    commitments should be made to Russia that would have the effect 
    of--
            (A) extending rights or imposing responsibilities on new 
        NATO members different from those applicable to current NATO 
        members, including rights or responsibilities with respect to 
        the deployment of nuclear weapons and the stationing of troops 
        and equipment from other NATO members;
            (B) limiting the ability of NATO to defend the territory of 
        new NATO members by, for example, restricting the construction 
        of defense infrastructure or limiting the ability of NATO to 
        deploy necessary reinforcements;
            (C) providing any international organization, or any 
        country that is not a member of NATO, with authority to delay, 
        veto, or otherwise impede deliberations and decisions of the 
        North Atlantic Council or the implementation of such decisions, 
        including deliberations and decisions with respect to the 
        deployment of NATO forces or the admission of additional 
        members to NATO;
            (D) impeding the development of enhanced relations between 
        NATO and other European countries that do not belong to the 
        Alliance;
            (E) establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in Central or 
        Eastern Europe;
            (F) requiring NATO to subsidize Russian arms sales, 
        service, or support to the militaries of those former Warsaw 
        Pact countries invited to join the Alliance; or
            (G) legitimizing Russian efforts to link concessions in 
        arms control negotiations to NATO enlargement.
        (3) Commitments from russia.--In order to enhance security and 
    stability in Europe, the United States should seek commitments from 
    Russia--
            (A) to demarcate and respect all its borders with 
        neighboring states;
            (B) to achieve the immediate and complete withdrawal of any 
        armed forces and military equipment under the control of Russia 
        that are deployed on the territories of the independent states 
        of the former Soviet Union without the full and complete 
        agreement of those states;
            (C) to station its armed forces on the territory of other 
        states only with the full and complete agreement of that state 
        and in strict accordance with international law; and
            (D) to take steps to reduce further its nuclear and 
        conventional forces in Kaliningrad.
        (4) Consultations.--As negotiations on adaptation of the Treaty 
    on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe proceed, the United States 
    should engage in close and continuous consultations not only with 
    its NATO allies, but also with the emerging democracies of Central 
    and Eastern Europe, Ukraine, and the South Caucasus.
    (c) Policy With Respect to Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation.--
        (1) In general.--As the United States proceeds with efforts to 
    develop defenses against ballistic missile attack, it should seek 
    to foster a climate of cooperation with Russia on matters related 
    to missile defense. In particular, the United States and its NATO 
    allies should seek to cooperate with Russia in such areas as early 
    warning.
        (2) Discussions with nato allies.--The United States should 
    initiate discussions with its NATO allies for the purpose of 
    examining the feasibility of deploying a ballistic missile defense 
    capable of protecting NATO's southern and eastern flanks from a 
    limited ballistic missile attack.
        (3) Constitutional prerogatives.--Even as the Congress seeks to 
    promote ballistic missile defense cooperation with Russia, it must 
    insist on its constitutional prerogatives regarding consideration 
    of arms control agreements with Russia that bear on ballistic 
    missile defense.

        alliance is in the national interests of the United States, a

        alliance is not in the national interests of the United States, 
        an alternative proposal to improve significantly efforts

SEC. 1808. CONGRESSIONAL STATEMENT REGARDING THE ACCESSION OF TAIWAN TO 
              THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The people of the United States and the people of the 
    Republic of China on Taiwan have long enjoyed extensive ties.
        (2) Taiwan is currently the 8th largest trading partner of the 
    United States.
        (3) The executive branch of Government has committed publicly 
    to support Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization and 
    has declared that the United States will not oppose this bid solely 
    on the grounds that the People's Republic of China, which also 
    seeks membership in the World Trade Organization, is not yet 
    eligible because of its unacceptable trade practices.
        (4) The United States and Taiwan have concluded discussions on 
    a variety of outstanding trade issues that remain unresolved with 
    the People's Republic of China and that are necessary for the 
    United States to support Taiwan's membership in the World Trade 
    Organization.
        (5) The reversion of control over Hong Kong--a member of the 
    World Trade Organization--to the People's Republic of China in many 
    respects affords to the People's Republic of China the practical 
    benefit of membership in the World Trade Organization for a 
    substantial portion of its trade in goods despite the fact that the 
    trade practices of the People's Republic of China currently fall 
    far short of what the United States expects for membership in the 
    World Trade Organization.
        (6) The executive branch of Government has announced its 
    interest in the admission of the People's Republic of China to the 
    World Trade Organization; the fundamental sense of fairness of the 
    people of the United States warrants the United States Government's 
    support for Taiwan's relatively more meritorious application for 
    membership in the World Trade Organization.
        (7) Despite having made significant progress in negotiations 
    for its accession to the World Trade Organization, Taiwan has yet 
    to offer acceptable terms of accession in agricultural and certain 
    other market sectors.
        (8) It is in the economic interest of United States consumers 
    and exporters for Taiwan to complete those requirements for 
    accession to the World Trade Organization at the earliest possible 
    moment.
    (b) Congressional Statement.--The Congress favors public support by 
officials of the Department of State for the accession of Taiwan to the 
World Trade Organization.

    the interests of the United States, the international community,

        (4) The Serbian authorities have sought to continue to hinder

    Serbia, in particular the broadcast news media, and have harassed 
    journalists performing their professional duties.

    Serbia has been denied free, fair, and equal opportunity to 
    participate in the democratic process.

        (1) the United States, the international community,

    independent news media, and press for the Government of the 
    Republic of Serbia to respect the rule of law; and
        (2) the normalization of relations between the ``Federal 
    Republic of Yugoslavia'' (Serbia and Montenegro) and the United 
    States requires, among other things, that President Milosevic and 
    the leadership of Serbia--
            (A) promote the building of democratic institutions, 
        including strengthening the independent news media and
