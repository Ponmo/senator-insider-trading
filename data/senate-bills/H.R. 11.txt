Subpart E--Research and Demonstration Provisions
SEC. 1381. MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds:
  (1) In the period since 1960 the average annual caseload of the aid to
  families with dependent children (AFDC) program under title IV of the
  Social Security Act has quintupled.
  (2) In 1990 there were on average almost twice as many households receiving
  aid to families with dependent children payments as the number of households
  and individuals receiving unemployment compensation benefits.
  (3) Nearly one-quarter of children born in the period 1967 through 1969
  were on welfare (AFDC) before reaching age 18. For minority children this
  ratio approached three-quarters.
  (4) At any given time one-quarter of school children are from single parent
  families, or households with neither parent. The National Assessment of
  Educational Progress has documented the educational losses associated with
  single parent or no parent households.
  (5) Only one-quarter of father-absent families receive full child support
  and over one-half receive none.
  (6) The average aid to families with dependent children benefit has declined
  by more than one-third since 1960.
  (7) The burden of welfare dependency is an issue of necessary concern
  to women, who in overwhelming proportion are the heads of single parent
  families.
  (8) The rate of welfare dependency may be rising. However, the statistical
  basis on which to assess this national issue is wholly inadequate, much as
  the statistical basis for addressing issues of unemployment was inadequate
  prior to the Employment Act of 1946, which required the creation of the
  annual economic report of the President and the development of unemployment
  rates.
  (b) CONGRESSIONAL POLICY- The Congress hereby declares that--
  (1) it is the policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to reduce
  welfare dependency to the lowest possible level, and to assist families
  toward self-sufficiency, consistent with other essential national goals;
  (2) it is the policy of the United States to strengthen families, to ensure
  that children grow up in families that are economically self-sufficient
  and to underscore the responsibility of parents to support their children;
  (3) the Federal Government should help welfare recipients as well as
  individuals at risk of welfare dependency to improve their education and
  job skills, to obtain access to necessary support services, and to take
  such other steps as may assist them to meet their responsibilities to
  become financially independent; and
  (4) it is the purpose of this section to aid in lowering welfare
  dependency by providing the public with generally accepted measures of
  welfare dependency so that it can track dependency over time and determine
  whether progress is being made in reducing welfare dependency and enabling
  families to be self-sufficient.
  (c) DEVELOPMENT OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY INDICATORS, RATES, AND PREDICTORS-
  (1) IN GENERAL- The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section
  referred to as the `Secretary') in consultation with the Secretary of
  Agriculture shall develop indicators, rates, and predictors of welfare
  dependency.

  (i) indicators and rates related to the level of welfare dependency in
  the United States; and
  (ii) predictors that are correlated with welfare dependency;
  (B) assess the data needed to report annually on the indicators, rates,
  and predictors, including the ability of existing data collection efforts
  to provide such data and any additional data collection needs; and
  (C) not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this section,
  provide an interim report containing conclusions resulting from the
  development and assessment described in subparagraphs (A) and (B), to--
  (i) the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives;
  (ii) the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives;
  (iii) the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives;

  (vii) the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.
  (3) CONSIDERATIONS- In developing the indicators, rates, and predictors, the
  Secretary shall consider the complexity of patterns of welfare dependency
  and self-sufficiency attainment, and the external factors, including the
  economy, that affect welfare dependency.
  (d) ADVISORY BOARD ON WELFARE DEPENDENCY-
  (1) ESTABLISHMENT- There is established an Advisory Board on Welfare
  Dependency (in this section referred to as the `Board').
  (2) COMPOSITION- The Board shall be composed of 12 members with equal

  later than the last day of the 3rd plan year beginning after the date of
  enactment with respect to all plan years as to which such election has been
  applicable and all subsequent plan years; provided that any amount paid

  in respect of benefits attributable to a taxable year during which such
  election was in effect shall be includible in income by the recipient in

  `(B) section 704(c) shall not apply to such property, and
  `(C) section 737 shall not apply.
  `(2) TREATMENT OF CONTRIBUTING PARTNER-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- In the case of any partner who makes a contribution of
  property to which this subsection applies--
  `(i) such partner shall recognize the precontribution gain or loss from
  such property as provided in this paragraph, and
  `(ii) appropriate adjustments to the basis of such partner's interest in the
  partnership shall be made for the amounts recognized under this paragraph.
  `(B) CHARACTER- The character of any gain or loss recognized under this
  paragraph shall be determined by reference to the character which would have
  resulted if the property had been sold to the partnership at the time of the
  contributions; except that any gain or loss recognized under subparagraph
  (C)(i) shall be treated as ordinary income or loss, as the case may be.
  `(C) TRANSACTIONS AT PARTNERSHIP LEVEL-
  `(i) DEPRECIATION, ETC- If any partnership deduction for depreciation,
  depletion, or amortization is increased by reason of an increase in the basis
  of any property under paragraph (1), the contributing partner shall recognize
  so much of the precontribution gain with respect to such property as does
  not exceed the increase in such deduction. If there is a precontribution
  loss, a similar rule shall apply to any decrease in such a deduction.
  `(ii) DISPOSITIONS-
  `(I) IN GENERAL- Except as otherwise provided in this clause, any
  precontribution gain or loss with respect to any property (to the extent
  not previously taken into account under this paragraph) shall be recognized
  by the contributing partner if the partnership makes any disposition of
  the property.
  `(II) DISTRIBUTIONS TO CONTRIBUTING PARTNER- No gain or loss shall
  be recognized under subclause (I) by reason of any distribution of the
  contributed property to the contributing partner (and subparagraph (D)(ii)
  shall not apply to any such distribution). In any such case, no adjustment
  shall be made under section 734 on account of such distribution and the
  adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the contributing partner
  shall be its adjusted basis immediately before the contribution properly
  adjusted for gain or loss previously recognized under this paragraph. If
  the property distributed consists of an interest in an entity, this
  subclause shall not apply to the extent that the value of such interest
  is attributable to property contributed to such entity after such interest
  had been contributed to the partnership.
  `(iii) YEAR FOR WHICH AMOUNT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- Any amount recognized
  under this subparagraph shall be taken into account for the partner's
  taxable year in which or with which ends the partnership taxable year of
  the deduction or disposition.
  `(D) TRANSACTIONS AT PARTNER LEVEL-
  `(i) IN GENERAL- If the contributing partner makes a disposition of any
  portion of his interest in the partnership, a corresponding portion of any
  precontribution gain or loss which was not previously taken into account
  under this paragraph shall be recognized for the partner's taxable year
  in which the disposition occurs. The preceding sentence shall not apply
  to a disposition at death.
  `(ii) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS- If--
  `(I) the amount of cash and the fair market value of property distributed
  to a partner, exceeds
  `(II) the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership
  immediately before the distribution (determined without regard to any
  adjustment under subparagraph (A)(ii) resulting from such distribution),
the contributing partner shall recognize so much of any precontribution gain
as does not exceed such excess.
  `(iii) SPECIAL RULE- Except as provided in clause (ii)(II), any basis
  adjustment under subparagraph (A)(ii) resulting from any gain or loss
  recognized under this subparagraph shall be treated as occurring immediately
  before the disposition or distribution involved.
  `(E) SECTION 267 AND 707(b) PRINCIPLES TO APPLY- No loss shall be recognized
  under subparagraph (C)(ii) or (D) by reason of any disposition (directly
  or indirectly) to a person related (within the meaning of section 267(b)
  or 707(b)(1)) to the contributing partner.
  `(F) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN NONTAXABLE EXCHANGES-
  `(i) SECTION 1031 AND 1033 TRANSACTIONS- If the disposition referred
  to in subclause (I) of subparagraph (C)(ii) is an exchange described in
  section 1031 or a compulsory or involuntary conversion within the meaning
  of section 1033--
  `(I) the amount of gain or loss recognized by the contributing partner
  under such subclause (I) shall not exceed the gain or loss recognized by
  the partnership on the disposition, and
  `(II) the replacement property shall be treated as the contributed property
  for purposes of this paragraph.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `replacement property'
means the property the basis of which is determined under section 1031(d)
or 1033(b), whichever is applicable.
  `(ii) CONTRIBUTIONS TO CONTROLLED PARTNERSHIP- If the disposition referred to
  in subclause (I) of subparagraph (C)(ii) is a contribution of the property
  to another partnership which is a controlled partnership--
  `(I) the rules of subclause (I) of clause (i) shall apply, and
  `(II) the partnership shall be treated as continuing to hold the contributed
  property so long as the other partnership continues to be a controlled
  partnership and continues to hold such property.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `controlled partnership'
means any partnership in which the partnership making the disposition owns
more than 50 percent of the capital interest or profits interest.
  `(3) PRECONTRIBUTION GAIN OR LOSS- For purposes of this subsection--
  `(A) PRECONTRIBUTION GAIN- The term `precontribution gain' means the excess
  (if any) of--
  `(i) the fair market value of the contributed property as of the time of
  the contribution, over
  `(ii) the adjusted basis of such property immediately before such
  contribution.
  `(B) PRECONTRIBUTION LOSS- The term `precontribution loss' means the excess
  (if any) of the amount referred to in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A)
  over the amount referred to in clause (i) of subparagraph (A).
  `(4) CONTRIBUTIONS TO WHICH SUBSECTION APPLIES- This subsection shall
  apply to any contribution of property (other than cash) which is made by
  any partner to a partnership if--

  partnership, or
  `(B) such contribution is to a partnership reasonably expected to become
  a large partnership.

the enactment of this part.
  `(c) CREDIT RECAPTURE DETERMINED AT PARTNERSHIP LEVEL-
  `(1) IN GENERAL- In the case of a large partnership--
  `(A) any credit recapture shall be taken into account by the partnership, and
  `(B) the amount of such recapture shall be determined as if the credit with
  respect to which the recapture is made had been fully utilized to reduce tax.
  `(2) METHOD OF TAKING RECAPTURE INTO ACCOUNT- A large partnership shall take
  into account a credit recapture by reducing the amount of the appropriate
  current year credit to the extent thereof, and if such recapture exceeds
  the amount of such current year credit, the partnership shall be liable
  to pay such excess.
  `(3) DISPOSITIONS NOT TO TRIGGER RECAPTURE- No credit recapture shall be
  required by reason of any transfer of an interest in a large partnership.
  `(4) CREDIT RECAPTURE- For purposes of this subsection, the term `credit
  recapture' means any increase in tax under section 42(j) or 50(a).

  case of a large partnership--

  TAKES EFFECT-
  `(1) IN GENERAL- If any partnership adjustment with respect to any
  partnership item takes effect (within the meaning of subsection (d)(2))
  during any partnership taxable year and if an election under paragraph
  (2) does not apply to such adjustment, such adjustment shall be taken
  into account in determining the amount of such item for the partnership
  taxable year in which such adjustment takes effect. In applying this title
  to any person who is (directly or indirectly) a partner in such partnership
  during such partnership taxable year, such adjustment shall be treated as
  an item actually arising during such taxable year.
  `(2) PARTNERSHIP LIABLE IN CERTAIN CASES- If--
  `(A) a partnership elects under this paragraph to not take an adjustment
  into account under paragraph (1),
  `(B) a partnership does not make such an election but in filing its return
  for any partnership taxable year fails to take fully into account any
  partnership adjustment as required under paragraph (1), or
  `(C) any partnership adjustment involves a reduction in a credit which
  exceeds the amount of such credit determined for the partnership taxable
  year in which the adjustment takes effect,
the partnership shall pay to the Secretary an amount determined by applying
the rules of subsection (b)(4) to the adjustments not so taken into account
and any excess referred to in subparagraph (C).
  `(3) OFFSETTING ADJUSTMENTS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- If a partnership adjustment
  requires another adjustment in a taxable year after the adjusted year and
  before the partnership taxable year in which such partnership adjustment
  takes effect, such other adjustment shall be taken into account under
  this subsection for the partnership taxable year in which such partnership
  adjustment takes effect.
  `(4) COORDINATION WITH PART II- Amounts taken into account under this
  subsection for any partnership taxable year shall continue to be treated
  as adjustments for the adjusted year for purposes of determining whether
  such amounts may be readjusted under part II.
  `(b) PARTNERSHIP LIABLE FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES-
  `(1) IN GENERAL- If a partnership adjustment takes effect during any
  partnership taxable year and such adjustment results in an imputed
  underpayment for the adjusted year, the partnership--
  `(A) shall pay to the Secretary interest computed under paragraph (2), and
  `(B) shall be liable for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount
  as provided in paragraph (3).
  `(2) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF INTEREST- The interest computed under this
  paragraph with respect to any partnership adjustment is the interest which
  would be determined under chapter 67--
  `(A) on the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (4) with
  respect to such adjustment, or
  `(B) for the period beginning on the day after the return due date for
  the adjusted year and ending on the return due date for the partnership
  taxable year in which such adjustment takes effect (or, if earlier, in
  the case of any adjustment to which subsection (a)(2) applies, the date
  on which the payment under subsection (a)(2) is made).
Proper adjustments in the amount determined under the preceding sentence
shall be made for adjustments required for partnership taxable years after
the adjusted year and before the year in which the partnership adjustment
takes effect by reason of such partnership adjustment.
  `(3) PENALTIES- A partnership shall be liable for any penalty, addition
  to tax, or additional amount for which it would have been liable if such
  partnership had been an individual subject to tax under chapter 1 for the
  adjusted year and the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (4)
  were an actual underpayment (or understatement) for such year.
  `(4) IMPUTED UNDERPAYMENT- For purposes of this subsection, the imputed
  underpayment determined under this paragraph with respect to any partnership
  adjustment is the underpayment (if any) which would result--
  `(A) by netting all adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, or
  deduction and--
  `(i) if such netting results in a net increase in income, by treating such
  net increase as an underpayment equal to the amount of such net increase
  multiplied by the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1 or 11 for
  the adjusted year, or
  `(ii) if such netting results in a net decrease in income, by treating
  such net decrease as an overpayment equal to such net decrease multiplied
  by such highest rate, and
  `(B) by taking adjustments to credits into account as increases or decreases
  (whichever is appropriate) in the amount of tax.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, any net decrease in a loss shall
be treated as an increase in income and a similar rule shall apply to a net
increase in a loss.
  `(c) ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS-

  `(A) shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as if it were a
  tax imposed by subtitle C, and

  taxable year in which the partnership adjustment takes effect.
  `(2) INTEREST- For purposes of determining interest, any payment required
  by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A) shall be treated as an underpayment of tax.
  `(3) PENALTIES-

  that taxable year), the treatment of any partnership item for the taxable
  year is finally determined, or any such item ceases to be a partnership
  item pursuant to section 6231(b), and
