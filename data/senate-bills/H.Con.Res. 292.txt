IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
March 18 (legislative day, JANUARY 30), 1992
Received and placed on the calendar
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
Expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to United States
participation in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED).
Whereas global environmental and development issues such as climate
change, depletion of the ozone layer, the disposal of hazardous chemicals,
deforestation, the loss of biological diversity, marine pollution, threats
to the world's supply of freshwater, and rapid population growth, are high
priority concerns of the United States, affecting the security and well-being
of present and future generations;
Whereas reducing poverty and promoting sustainable economic growth and sound
environmental management in the developing world are also high priority
concerns of the United States;
Whereas these urgent global environmental and developmental challenges will
require increased international cooperation between developing countries
and developed countries, as well as strengthened international institutions;
Whereas the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be
held in Brazil in June 1992, represents an important opportunity to reach
agreements on such international cooperation;
Whereas the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development should be
viewed as a milestone in a continuing process of improving the international
response to the issues within its purview;
Whereas the role of the United States in negotiations on the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development is crucial to its success; and
Whereas the final Preparatory Committee meeting for the UNCED will be held
during March and April of 1992: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it
  is the sense of the Congress that, consistent with national sovereignty
  considerations, the position of the United States at the United Nations
  Conference on Environment and Development should--
  (1) place the highest priority on the success of the United Nations
  Conference on Environment and Development by participating actively in the
  UNCED, particularly through the personal participation of the President
  of the United States;
  (2) negotiate international agreements that effectively reduce the threat
  of climate change and biological diversity loss;
  (3) propose and/or support an initiative on financing global environmental
  cooperation efforts that--
  (A) takes into account the additional costs of international environmental
  protection and the basic development goals of developing countries; and
  (B) increases accountability for the use of funds provided for environmental
  purposes;
  (4) seek to advance the development of a stronger international legal
  framework, and the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms, for
  protecting the global environment, including a process for monitoring
  compliance by nations with environmental agreements in force and
  monitoring compliance by all multilateral institutions with requirements
  for environmental impact assessment;
  (5) seek to initiate a process of regular, high-level intergovernmental
  consultations on the issues that are under consideration at UNCED and to
  establish improved organizational and procedural means to implement the
  objectives of UNCED;
  (6) support programs aimed at encouraging a global transition to efficient
  and environmentally sustainable energy systems, including priority on more
  efficient transportation systems and renewable sources of energy;
  (7) support new programs and institutions to help developing countries
  become more energy efficient and otherwise increase their capacity for
  acquiring and using technology to make their economies more environmentally
  sustainable, such as training and research centers for energy efficiency
  and renewable energy sources;
  (8) support global goals of slowing deforestation of primary forests,
  increasing worldwide forest cover, and preserving a specified amount of
  mature forests, and increase support for improved forest strategies that
  integrate all policy issues related to the loss of forests and eliminate
  economic incentives for deforestation;
  (9) support the effective implementation of a global action plan to raise
  the economic, educational, and leadership status of women;
  (10) support the development of new agreements to eliminate land-based
  sources of marine pollution and support cooperative efforts to address
  these sources of pollution at the regional level;
  (11) support a process of international consultations involving relevant
  governments and multinational institutions aimed at identifying ways that
  poverty can be alleviated and natural resources better conserved through
  reduction of developing country debt burdens;
  (12) support the development of a reformed system of national accounting
  that would reflect the full economic costs of environmental and resource
  degradation and the benefits of the sustainable use of natural resources;
  (13) promote public participation in environmental and development decisions
  at all levels including a right for communities to be fully informed on
  the environmental threats to their well being; and
  (14) support programs that provide maternal and child health care, education
  and training especially for women, and voluntary family planning.
Passed the House of Representatives March 17, 1992.
