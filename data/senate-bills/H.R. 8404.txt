Public Law 117-228
117th Congress

                                 An Act


 
   To repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure respect for State 
    regulation of marriage, and for other purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 13, 
                         2022 -  [H.R. 8404]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Respect for 
Marriage Act. 1 USC 1 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Respect for Marriage Act''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 1 USC 7 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies 
        the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and 
        family.
            (2) Diverse beliefs about the role of gender in marriage are 
        held by reasonable and sincere people based on decent and 
        honorable religious or philosophical premises. Therefore, 
        Congress affirms that such people and their diverse beliefs are 
        due proper respect.
            (3) Millions of people, including interracial and same-sex 
        couples, have entered into marriages and have enjoyed the rights 
        and privileges associated with marriage. Couples joining in 
        marriage deserve to have the dignity, stability, and ongoing 
        protection that marriage affords to families and children.
SEC. 3. REPEAL OF SECTION ADDED TO TITLE 28, UNITED STATES CODE, 
                    BY SECTION 2 OF THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT.

    Section 1738C of title 28, United States Code, is repealed.
SEC. 4. FULL FAITH AND CREDIT GIVEN TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY.

    Chapter 115 of title 28, United States Code, as amended by this Act, 
is further amended by inserting after section 1738B the following:
``Sec. 1738C. <<NOTE: 28 USC 1738C.>>  Certain acts, records, and 
                    proceedings and the effect thereof

            ``(2) a right or claim arising from such a marriage on the
