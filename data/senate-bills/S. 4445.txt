(2) To promote the right and ability of a patient residing in any State to choose to receive fertility treatment provided in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based medical standards of care by a health care provider who chooses to provide such services.
(3) To protect an individual’s right to make decisions, in consultation with the individual's health care provider, about the most appropriate medical care to maximize the chance of becoming pregnant and giving birth to a healthy, living, human child with the help of fertility treatment.
