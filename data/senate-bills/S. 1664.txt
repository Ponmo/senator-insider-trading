                        to employers;
                            (V) the reduction of undocumented workers 
                        in the United States labor force resulting from 
                        the system;
                            (VI) any unlawful discrimination caused by 
                        or facilitated by use of the system;
                            (VII) any privacy intrusions caused by 
                        misuse or abuse of system;
                            (VIII) the accuracy rate of the system; and
                            (IX) the overall costs and benefits that 
                        would result from implementation of the system.
    (2) The plan described in paragraph (1) shall take effect on the 
date of enactment of a bill or joint resolution approving the plan.
    (b) Objectives.--The plan described in subsection (a)(1) shall have 
the following objectives:
            (1) To substantially reduce illegal immigration and 
        unauthorized employment of aliens.
            (2) To increase employer compliance, especially in industry 
        sectors known to employ undocumented workers, with laws 
        governing employment of aliens.
            (3) To protect individuals from national origin or 
        citizenship-based unlawful discrimination and from loss of 
        privacy caused by use, misuse, or abuse of personal 
        information.
            (4) To minimize the burden on business of verification of 
        eligibility for employment in the United States, including the 
        cost of the system to employers.
            (5) To ensure that those who are ineligible for public 
        assistance or other government benefits are denied or 
        terminated, and that those eligible for public assistance or 
        other government benefits shall--
                    (A) be provided a reasonable opportunity to submit 
                evidence indicating a satisfactory immigration status; 
                and
                    (B) not have eligibility for public assistance or 
                other government benefits denied, reduced, terminated, 
                or unreasonably delayed on the basis of the 
                individual's immigration status until such a reasonable 
                opportunity has been provided.
    (c) System Requirements.--(1) A verification system may not be 
implemented under this section unless the system meets the following 
requirements:
            (A) The system must be capable of reliably determining with 
        respect to an individual whether--
                    (i) the person with the identity claimed by the 
                individual is authorized to work in the United States 
                or has the immigration status being claimed; and
                    (ii) the individual is claiming the identity of 
                another person.
            (B) Any document (other than a document used under section 
        274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act) required by the 
        system must be presented to or examined by either an employer 
        or an administrator of public assistance or other government 
        benefits, as the case may be, and--
                    (i) must be in a form that is resistant to 
                counterfeiting and to tampering; and
                    (ii) must not be required by any Government entity 
                or agency as a national identification card or to be 
                carried or presented except--
                            (I) to verify eligibility for employment in 
                        the United States or immigration status in the 
                        United States for purposes of eligibility for 
                        benefits under public assistance programs (as 
                        defined in section 201(f)(3) or government 
                        benefits described in section 201(f)(4));
                            (II) to enforce the Immigration and 
                        Nationality Act or sections 911, 1001, 1028, 
                        1542, 1546, or 1621 of title 18, United States 
                        Code; or
                            (III) if the document was designed for 
                        another purposes (such as a license to drive a 
                        motor vehicle, a certificate of birth, or a 
                        social security account number card issued by 
                        the Administration), as required under law for 
                        such other purpose.
            (C) The system must not be used for law enforcement 
        purposes other than the purposes described in subparagraph (B).
            (D) The system must ensure that information is complete, 
        accurate, verifiable, and timely. Corrections or additions to 
        the system records of an individual provided by the individual, 
        the Administration, or the Service, or other relevant Federal 
        agency, must be checked for accuracy, processed, and entered 
        into the system within 10 business days after the agency's 
        acquisition of the correction or additional information.
            (E)(i) Any personal information obtained in connection with 
        a demonstration project under section 112 must not be made 
        available to Government agencies, employers, or other persons 
        except to the extent necessary--
                    (I) to verify, by an individual who is authorized 
                to conduct the employment verification process, that an 
                employee is not an unauthorized alien (as defined in 
                section 274A(h)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality 
                Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3));
                    (II) to take other action required to carry out 
                section 112;
                    (III) to enforce the Immigration and Nationality 
                Act or section 911, 1001, 1028, 1542, 1546, or 1621 of 
                title 18, United States Code; or
                    (IV) to verify the individual's immigration status 
                for purposes of determining eligibility for Federal 
                benefits under public assistance programs (defined in 
                section 201(f)(3) or government benefits described in 
                section 201(f)(4)).
            (ii) In order to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and 
        security of system information, the system and those who use 
        the system must maintain appropriate administrative, technical, 
        and physical safeguards, such as--
                    (I) safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure 
                of personal information, including passwords, 
                cryptography, and other technologies;
                    (II) audit trails to monitor system use; or
                    (III) procedures giving an individual the right to 
                request records containing personal information about 
                the individual held by agencies and used in the system, 
                for the purpose of examination, copying, correction, or 
                amendment, and a method that ensures notice to 
                individuals of these procedures.
            (F) A verification that a person is eligible for employment 
        in the United States may not be withheld or revoked under the 
        system for any reasons other than a determination pursuant to 
        section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
            (G) The system must be capable of accurately verifying 
        electronically within 5 business days, whether a person has the 
        required immigration status in the United States and is legally 
        authorized for employment in the United States in a substantial 
        percentage of cases (with the objective of not less than 99 
        percent).
            (H) There must be reasonable safeguards against the 
        system's resulting in unlawful discriminatory practices based 
        on national origin or citizenship status, including--
                    (i) the selective or unauthorized use of the system 
                to verify eligibility;
                    (ii) the use of the system prior to an offer of 
                employment;
                    (iii) the exclusion of certain individuals from 
                consideration for employment as a result of a perceived 
                likelihood that additional verification will be 
                required, beyond what is required for most job 
                applicants; or
                    (iv) denial reduction, termination, or unreasonable 
                delay of public assistance to an individual as a result 
                of the perceived likelihood that such additional 
                verification will be required.
    (2) As used in this subsection, the term ``business day'' means any 
day other than Saturday, Sunday, or any day on which the appropriate 
Federal agency is closed.
    (d) Remedies and Penalties for Unlawful Disclosure.--
            (1) Civil remedies.--
                    (A) Right of informational privacy.--The Congress 
                declares that any person who provides to an employer 
                the information required by this section or section 
                274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                1324a) has a privacy expectation that the information 
                will only be used for compliance with this Act or other 
                applicable Federal, State, or local law.
                    (B) Civil actions.--A employer, or other person or 
                entity, who knowingly and willfully discloses the 
                information that an employee is required to provide by 
                this section or section 274A of the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a) for any purpose not 
                authorized by this Act or other applicable Federal, 
                State, or local law shall be liable to the employee for 
                actual damages. An action may be brought in any 
                Federal, State, or local court having jurisdiction over 
                the matter.
            (2) Criminal penalties.--Any employer, or other person or 
        entity, who willfully and knowingly obtains, uses, or discloses 
        information required pursuant to this section or section 274A 
        of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a) for any 
        purpose not authorized by this Act or other applicable Federal, 
        State, or local law shall be found guilty of a misdemeanor and 
        fined not more than $5,000.
            (3) Privacy act.--
                    (A) In general.--Any person who is a United States 
                citizen, United States national, lawful permanent 
                resident, or other employment-authorized alien, and who 
                is subject to verification of work authorization or 
                lawful presence in the United States for purposes of 
                benefits eligibility under this section or section 112, 
                shall be considered an individual under section 
                552(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code, with respect 
                to records covered by this section.
                    (B) Definition.--For purposes of this paragraph, 
                the term ``record'' means an item, collection, or 
                grouping of information about an individual which--
                            (i) is created, maintained, or used by a 
                        Federal agency for the purpose of determining--
                                    (I) the individual's authorization 
                                to work; or
                                    (II) immigration status in the 
                                United States for purposes of 
                                eligibility to receive Federal, State 
                                or local benefits in the United States; 
                                and
                            (ii) contains the individuals's name or 
                        identifying number, symbol, or any other 
                        identifier assigned to the individual.
    (e) Employer Safeguards.--An employer shall not be liable for any 
penalty under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act for 
employing an unauthorized alien, if--
            (1) the alien appeared throughout the term of employment to 
        be prima facie eligible for the employment under the 
        requirements of section 274A(b) of such Act;
            (2) the employer followed all procedures required in the 
        system; and
            (3)(A) the alien was verified under the system as eligible 
        for the employment; or
            (B) the employer discharged the alien within a reasonable 
        period after receiving notice that the final verification 
        procedure had failed to verify that the alien was eligible for 
        the employment.
    (f) Restriction on Use of Documents.--If the Attorney General 
determines that any document described in section 274A(b)(1) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act as establishing employment 
authorization or identity does not reliably establish such 
authorization or identity or, to an unacceptable degree, is being used 
fraudulently or is being requested for purposes not authorized by this 
Act, the Attorney General may, by regulation, prohibit or place 
conditions on the use of the document for purposes of the system or the 
verification system established in section 274A(b) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act.
    (g) Protection From Liability for Actions Taken on the Basis of 
Information Provided by the Verification System.--No person shall be 
civilly or criminally liable under section 274A of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act for any action adverse to an individual if such action 
was taken in good faith reliance on information relating to such 
individual provided through the system (including any demonstration 
project conducted under section 112).
    (h) Statutory Construction.--The provisions of this section 
supersede the provisions of section 274A of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act to the extent of any inconsistency therewith.

    (a) Authority.--
            (1) In general.--(A)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the 
        President, acting through the Attorney General, shall begin 
        conducting several local and regional projects, and a project 
        in the legislative branch of the Federal Government, to 
        demonstrate the feasibility of alternative systems for 
        verifying eligibility for employment in the United States, and 
        immigration status in the United States for purposes of 
        eligibility for benefits under public assistance programs (as 
        defined in section 201(f)(3) and government benefits described 
        in section 201(f)(4)).
            (ii) Each project under this section shall be consistent 
        with the objectives of section 111(b) and this section and 
        shall be conducted in accordance with an agreement entered into 
        with the State, locality, employer, other entity, or the 
        legislative branch of the Federal Government, as the case may 
        be.
            (iii) In determining which State(s), localities, employers, 
        or other entities shall be designated for such projects, the 
        Attorney General shall take into account the estimated number 
        of excludable aliens and deportable aliens in each State or 
        locality.
            (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``legislative 
        branch of the Federal Government'' includes all offices 
        described in section 101(9) of the Congressional Accountability 
        Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1301(9)) and all agencies of the 
        legislative branch of Government.
            (2) Description of projects.--Demonstration projects 
        conducted under this subsection may include, but are not 
        limited to--
                    (A) a system which allows employers to verify the 
                eligibility for employment of new employees using 
                Administration records and, if necessary, to conduct a 
                cross-check using Service records;
                    (B) a simulated linkage of the electronic records 
                of the Service and the Administration to test the 
                technical feasibility of establishing a linkage between 
                the actual electronic records of the Service and the 
                Administration;
                    (C) improvements and additions to the electronic 
                records of the Service and the Administration for the 
                purpose of using such records for verification of 
                employment eligibility;
                    (D) a system which allows employers to verify the 
                continued eligibility for employment of employees with 
                temporary work authorization;
                    (E) a system that requires employers to verify the 
                validity of employee social security account numbers 
                through a telephone call, and to verify employee 
                identity through a United States passport, a State 
                driver's license or identification document, or a 
                document issued by the Service for purposes of this 
                clause;
                    (F) a system which is based on State-issued 
                driver's licenses and identification cards that include 
                a machine readable social security account number and 
                are resistant to tampering and counterfeiting; and
                    (G) a system that requires employers to verify with 
                the Service the immigration status of every employee 
                except one who has attested that he or she is a United 
                States citizen or national.
            (3) Commencement date.--The first demonstration project 
        under this section shall commence not later than six months 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (4) Termination date.--The authority of paragraph (1) shall 
        cease to be effective four years after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, except that, if the President determines that any one 
        or more of the projects conducted pursuant to paragraph (2) 
        should be renewed, or one or more additional projects should be 
        conducted before a plan is recommended under section 
        111(a)(1)(A), the President may conduct such project or 
        projects for up to an additional three-year period, without 
        regard to section 274A(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act.
    (b) Objectives.--The objectives of the demonstration projects 
conducted under this section are--
            (1) to assist the Attorney General in measuring the 
        benefits and costs of systems for verifying eligibility for 
        employment in the United States, and immigration status in the 
        United States for purposes of eligibility for benefits under 
        public assistance programs defined in section 201(f)(3) and for 
        government benefits described in section 201(f)(4);
            (2) to assist the Service and the Administration in 
        determining the accuracy of Service and Administration data 
        that may be used in such systems; and
            (3) to provide the Attorney General with information 
        necessary to make determinations regarding the likely effects 
        of the tested systems on employers, employees, and other 
        individuals, including information on--
                    (A) losses of employment to individuals as a result 
                of inaccurate information in the system;

    (a) Ineligibility.--Section 235 (8 U.S.C. 1225) is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), any alien who has not been 
admitted to the United States, and who is excludable under section 
212(a)(6)(C)(iii) or who is an alien described in paragraph (3), is 
ineligible for withholding of deportation pursuant to section 243(h), 
and may not apply therefor or for any other relief under this Act, 
except that an alien found to have a credible fear of persecution or of 
return to persecution in accordance with section 208(e) shall be taken 
before a special inquiry officer for exclusion proceedings in 
accordance with section 236 and may apply for asylum, withholding of 
deportation, or both, in the course of such proceedings.
    ``(2) An alien described in paragraph (1) who has been found 
ineligible to apply for asylum under section 208(e) may be returned 
under the provisions of this section only to a country in which (or 
from which) he or she has no credible fear of persecution (or of return 
to persecution). If there is no country to which the alien can be 
returned in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the alien 
shall be taken before a special inquiry officer for exclusion 
proceedings in accordance with section 236 and may apply for asylum, 
withholding of deportation, or both, in the course of such proceedings.
    ``(3) Any alien who is excludable under section 212(a), and who has 
been brought or escorted under the authority of the United States--
            ``(A) into the United States, having been on board a vessel 
        encountered seaward of the territorial sea by officers of the 
        United States; or
            ``(B) to a port of entry, having been on board a vessel 
        encountered within the territorial sea or internal waters of 
        the United States;
shall either be detained on board the vessel on which such person 
arrived or in such facilities as are designated by the Attorney General 
or paroled in the discretion of the Attorney General pursuant to 
section 212(d)(5) pending accomplishment of the purpose for which the 
person was brought or escorted into the United States or to the port of 
entry, except that no alien shall be detained on board a public vessel 
of the United States without the concurrence of the head of the 
department under whose authority the vessel is operating.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 237(a) (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)) is 
amended--
            (1) in the second sentence of paragraph (1), by striking 
        ``Deportation'' and inserting ``Subject to section 235(d)(2), 
        deportation''; and
            (2) in the first sentence of paragraph (2), by striking 
        ``If'' and inserting ``Subject to section 235(d)(2), if''.

    (a) Amendments to Title 18.--Sections 1581, 1583, 1584, and 1588 of 
title 18, United States Code, are amended by striking ``five'' each 
place it appears and inserting ``10''.

Commission shall ascertain whether there exists an unwarranted 
disparity--
            (1) between the sentences for peonage, involuntary 
        servitude, and slave trade offenses, and the sentences for 
        kidnapping offenses in effect on the date of the enactment of 
        this Act; and
            (2) between the sentences for peonage, involuntary 
        servitude, and slave trade offenses, and the sentences for 
        alien smuggling offenses in effect on the date of the enactment 
        of this Act and after the amendment made by subsection (a).
    (c) Amendment of Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant to its authority 
under section 994(p) of title 28, United States Code, the United States 
Sentencing Commission shall review its guidelines on sentencing for 
peonage, involuntary servitude, and slave trade offenses under sections 
1581 through 1588 of title 18, United States Code, and shall amend such 
guidelines as necessary to--
            (1) reduce or eliminate any unwarranted disparity found 
        under subsection (b) that exists between the sentences for 
        peonage, involuntary servitude, and slave trade offenses, and 
        the sentences for kidnapping offenses and alien smuggling 
        offenses;
            (2) ensure that the applicable guidelines for defendants 
        convicted of peonage, involuntary servitude, and slave trade 
        offenses are sufficiently stringent to deter such offenses and 
        adequately reflect the heinous nature of such offenses; and
            (3) ensure that the guidelines reflect the general 
        appropriateness of enhanced sentences for defendants whose 
        peonage, involuntary servitude, or slave trade offenses 
        involve--
                    (A) a large number of victims;
                    (B) the use or threatened use of a dangerous 
                weapon; or
                    (C) a prolonged period of peonage or involuntary 
                servitude.

designated port of entry, the alien may be returned to that territory 
pending the inquiry.''.
    (b) Special Orders of Exclusion and Deportation.--Section 235 (8 
U.S.C. 1225), as amended by section 132 of this Act, is further amended 
by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this 
section and section 236, the Attorney General may, without referral to 
a special inquiry officer or after such a referral, order the exclusion 
and deportation of any alien if--
            ``(A) the alien appears to an examining immigration 
        officer, or to a special inquiry officer if such referral is 
        made, to be an alien who--
                    ``(i) has entered the United States without having 
                been inspected and admitted by an immigration officer 
                pursuant to this section, unless such alien 
                affirmatively demonstrates to the satisfaction of such 
                immigration officer or special inquiry officer that he 
                has been physically present in the United States for an 
                uninterrupted period of at least two years since such 
                entry without inspection;

                212(a)(6)(C)(iii);

                territorial waters of the United States by officers of 
                the United States;
                    ``(iv) is brought or escorted under the authority 
                of the United States to a port of entry, having been on 
                board a vessel encountered within the territorial sea 
                or internal waters of the United States; or
                    ``(v) has arrived on a vessel transporting aliens 
                to the United States without such alien having received 
                prior official authorization to come to, enter, or 
                reside in the United States; or
            ``(B) the Attorney General has determined that the numbers 
        or circumstances of aliens en route to or arriving in the 
        United States, by land, sea, or air, present an extraordinary 
        migration situation.
    ``(2) As used in this section, the phrase `extraordinary migration 
situation' means the arrival or imminent arrival in the United States 
or its territorial waters of aliens who by their numbers or 
circumstances substantially exceed the capacity for the inspection and 
examination of such aliens.
    ``(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the determination of whether 
there exists an extraordinary migration situation or whether to invoke 
the provisions of paragraph (1) (A) or (B) is committed to the sole and 
exclusive discretion of the Attorney General.
    ``(B) The provisions of this subsection may be invoked under 
paragraph (1)(B) for a period not to exceed 90 days, unless, within 
such 90-day period or an extension thereof authorized by this 
subparagraph, the Attorney General determines, after consultation with 
the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives, that an extraordinary migration situation continues to 
warrant such procedures remaining in effect for an additional 90-day 
period.
    ``(4) When the Attorney General invokes the provisions of clause 
(iii), (iv), or (v) of paragraph (1)(A) or paragraph (1)(B), the 
Attorney General may, pursuant to this section and sections 235(e) and 
106(f), suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of immigration 
regulations regarding the inspection and exclusion of aliens.
    ``(5) No alien may be ordered specially excluded under paragraph 
(1) if--

        under section 208; and
            ``(B) the Attorney General determines, in the procedure 
        described in section 208(e), that such alien has a credible 
        fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, 
        membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, 
        in the country of such person's nationality, or in the case of 
        a person having no nationality, the country in which such 
        person last habitually resided.
An alien may be returned to a country in which the alien does not have 
a credible fear of persecution and from which the alien does not have a 
credible fear of return to persecution.
    ``(6) A special exclusion order entered in accordance with the 
provisions of this subsection is not subject to administrative review, 
except that the Attorney General shall provide by regulation for prompt 
review of such an order against an applicant who claims under oath, or 
as permitted under penalty of perjury under section 1746 of title 28, 
United States Code, after having been warned of the penalties for 
falsely making such claim under such conditions, to be, and appears to 
be, lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
    ``(7) A special exclusion order entered in accordance with the 
provisions of this subsection shall have the same effect as if the 
alien had been ordered excluded and deported pursuant to section 236, 
except that judicial review of such an order shall be available only 
under section 106(f).
    ``(8) Nothing in this subsection may be construed as requiring an 
inquiry before a special inquiry officer in the case of an alien 
crewman.''.

SEC. 142. STREAMLINING JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ORDERS OF EXCLUSION OR 
              DEPORTATION.

    (a) In General.--Section 106 (8 U.S.C. 1105a) is amended to read as 
follows:

  ``judicial review of orders of deportation, exclusion, and special 
                               exclusion

    ``Sec. 106. (a) Applicable Provisions.--Except as provided in 
subsection (b), judicial review of a final order of exclusion or 
deportation is governed only by chapter 158 of title 28 of the United 
States Code, but in no such review may a court order the taking of 
additional evidence pursuant to section 2347(c) of title 28, United 
States Code.
    ``(b) Requirements.--(1)(A) A petition for judicial review must be 
filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of 
exclusion or deportation, except that in the case of any specially 
deportable criminal alien (as defined in section 242(k)), there shall 
be no judicial review of any final order of deportation.
    ``(B) The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a 
petition for judicial review not later than 40 days after the date on 
which the administrative record is available, and may serve and file a 
reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief of the 
Attorney General, and the court may not extend these deadlines except 
upon motion for good cause shown.
    ``(C) If an alien fails to file a brief in connection with a 
petition for judicial review within the time provided in this 
paragraph, the Attorney General may move to dismiss the appeal, and the 
court shall grant such motion unless a manifest injustice would result.
    ``(2) A petition for judicial review shall be filed with the court 
of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the special inquiry 
officer completed the proceedings.
    ``(3) The respondent of a petition for judicial review shall be the 
Attorney General. The petition shall be served on the Attorney General 
and on the officer or employee of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service in charge of the Service district in which the final order of 
exclusion or deportation was entered. Service of the petition on the 
officer or employee does not stay the deportation of an alien pending 
the court's decision on the petition, unless the court orders 
otherwise.
    ``(4)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (5)(B), the court of 
appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on 
which the order of exclusion or deportation is based and the Attorney 
General's findings of fact shall be conclusive unless a reasonable 
adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
    ``(B) The Attorney General's discretionary judgment whether to 
grant relief under section 212 (c) or (i), 244 (a) or (d), or 245 shall 
be conclusive and shall not be subject to review.
    ``(C) The Attorney General's discretionary judgment whether to 
grant relief under section 208(a) shall be conclusive unless manifestly 
contrary to law and an abuse of discretion.
    ``(5)(A) If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United 
States and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits 
that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's 
nationality is presented, the court shall decide the nationality claim.
    ``(B) If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United 
States and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material 
fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall 
transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United States for 
the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing 
on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action 
had been brought in the district court under section 2201 of title 28, 
United States Code.
    ``(C) The petitioner may have the nationality claim decided only as 
provided in this section.
    ``(6)(A) If the validity of an order of deportation has not been 
judicially decided, a defendant in a criminal proceeding charged with 
violating subsection (d) or (e) of section 242 may challenge the 
validity of the order in the criminal proceeding only by filing a 
separate motion before trial. The district court, without a jury, shall 
decide the motion before trial.
    ``(B) If the defendant claims in the motion to be a national of the 
United States and the district court finds that no genuine issue of 
material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court 
shall decide the motion only on the administrative record on which the 
deportation order is based. The administrative findings of fact are 
conclusive if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative 
evidence on the record considered as a whole.
    ``(C) If the defendant claims in the motion to be a national of the 
United States and the district court finds that a genuine issue of 
material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court 
shall hold a new hearing on the nationality claim and decide that claim 
as if an action had been brought under section 2201 of title 28, United 
States Code.
    ``(D) If the district court rules that the deportation order is 
invalid, the court shall dismiss the indictment. The United States 
Government may appeal the dismissal to the court of appeals for the 
appropriate circuit within 30 days. The defendant may not file a 
petition for review under this section during the criminal proceeding. 
The defendant may have the nationality claim decided only as provided 
in this section.
    ``(7) This subsection--
            ``(A) does not prevent the Attorney General, after a final 
        order of deportation has been issued, from detaining the alien 
        under section 242(c);
            ``(B) does not relieve the alien from complying with 
        subsection (d) or (e) of section 242; and
            ``(C) except as provided in paragraph (3), does not require 
        the Attorney General to defer deportation of the alien.
    ``(8) The record and briefs do not have to be printed. The court of 
appeals shall review the proceeding on a typewritten record and on 
typewritten briefs.
    ``(c) Requirements for Petition.--A petition for review of an order 
of exclusion or deportation shall state whether a court has upheld the 
validity of the order, and, if so, shall state the name of the court, 
the date of the court's ruling, and the kind of proceeding.
    ``(d) Review of Final Orders.--
            ``(1) A court may review a final order of exclusion or 
        deportation only if--
                    ``(A) the alien has exhausted all administrative 
                remedies available to the alien as a matter of right; 
                and
                    ``(B) another court has not decided the validity of 
                the order, unless, subject to paragraph (2), the 
                reviewing court finds that the petition presents 
                grounds that could not have been presented in the prior 
                judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the 
                prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test 
                the validity of the order.
            ``(2) Nothing in paragraph (1)(B) may be construed as 
        creating a right of review if such review would be inconsistent 
        with subsection (e), (f), or (g), or any other provision of 
        this section.
    ``(e) No Judicial Review for Orders of Deportation or Exclusion 
Entered Against Certain Criminal Aliens.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, any order of exclusion or deportation against an 
alien who is excludable or deportable by reason of having committed any 
criminal offense described in subparagraph (A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) 
of section 241(a)(2), or two or more offenses described in section 
241(a)(2)(A)(ii), at least two of which resulted in a sentence or 
confinement described in section 241(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), is not subject to 
review by any court.
    ``(f) Limited Review for Special Exclusion and Document Fraud.--(1) 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as provided in this 
subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any individual 
determination or to hear any other cause of action or claim arising 
from or relating to the implementation or operation of sections 208(e), 
212(a)(6)(iii), 235(d), and 235(e).
    ``(2)(A) Except as provided in this subsection, there shall be no 
judicial review of--
            ``(i) a decision by the Attorney General to invoke the 
        provisions of section 235(e);
            ``(ii) the application of section 235(e) to individual 
        aliens, including the determination made under paragraph (5); 
        or
            ``(iii) procedures and policies adopted by the Attorney 
        General to implement the provisions of section 235(e).
    ``(B) Without regard to the nature of the action or claim, or the 
identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court shall 
have jurisdiction or authority to enter declaratory, injunctive, or 
other equitable relief not specifically authorized in this subsection, 
or to certify a class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.
    ``(3) Judicial review of any cause, claim, or individual 
determination made or arising under or relating to section 208(e), 
212(a)(6)(iii), 235(d), or 235(e) shall only be available in a habeas 
corpus proceeding, and shall be limited to determinations of--
            ``(A) whether the petitioner is an alien;
            ``(B) whether the petitioner was ordered specially 
        excluded; and
            ``(C) whether the petitioner can prove by a preponderance 
        of the evidence that he or she is an alien lawfully admitted 
        for permanent residence and is entitled to such further inquiry 
        as is prescribed by the Attorney General pursuant to section 
        235(e)(6).
    ``(4)(A) In any case where the court determines that the 
petitioner--
            ``(i) is an alien who was not ordered specially excluded 
        under section 235(e), or
            ``(ii) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence 
        that he or she is a lawful permanent resident,
the court may order no remedy or relief other than to require that the 
petitioner be provided a hearing in accordance with section 236 or a 
determination in accordance with section 235(c) or 273(d).
    ``(B) Any alien who is provided a hearing under section 236 
pursuant to these provisions may thereafter obtain judicial review of 
any resulting final order of exclusion pursuant to this section.
    ``(5) In determining whether an alien has been ordered specially 
excluded under section 235(e), the court's inquiry shall be limited to 
whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to the 
petitioner. There shall be no review of whether the alien is actually 
excludable or entitled to any relief from exclusion.
    ``(g) No Collateral Attack.--In any action brought for the 
assessment of penalties for improper entry or reentry of an alien under 
section 275 or 276, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear claims 
attacking the validity of orders of exclusion, special exclusion, or 
deportation entered under section 235, 236, or 242.''.
    (b) Rescission of Order.--Section 242B(c)(3) (8 U.S.C. 1252b(c)(3)) 
is amended by striking the period at the end and inserting ``by the 
special inquiry officer, but there shall be no stay pending further 
administrative or judicial review, unless ordered because of 
individually compelling circumstances.''.
    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the Act is 
amended by amending the item relating to section 106 to read as 
follows:

SEC. 170. PRISONER TRANSFER TREATIES.

    (a) Negotiations With Other Countries.--(1) Congress advises the 
President to begin to negotiate and renegotiate, not later than 90 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, bilateral prisoner transfer 
treaties, providing for the incarceration, in the country of the 
alien's nationality, of any alien who--
            (A) is a national of a country that is party to such a 
        treaty; and
            (B) has been convicted of a criminal offense under Federal 
        or State law and who--
                    (i) is not in lawful immigration status in the 
                United States, or
                    (ii) on the basis of conviction for a criminal 
                offense under Federal or State law, or on any other 
                basis, is subject to deportation under the Immigration 
                and Nationality Act,
for the duration of the prison term to which the alien was sentenced 
for the offense referred to in subparagraph (B). Any such agreement may 
provide for the release of such alien pursuant to parole procedures of 
that country.
    (2) In entering into negotiations under paragraph (1), the 
President may consider providing for appropriate compensation, subject 
to the availability of appropriations, in cases where the United States 
is able to independently verify the adequacy of the sites where aliens 
will be imprisoned and the length of time the alien is actually 
incarcerated in the foreign country under such a treaty.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the focus of negotiations for such agreements should 
        be--
                    (A) to expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully 
                in the United States who are (or are about to be) 
                incarcerated in United States prisons,
                    (B) to ensure that a transferred prisoner serves 
                the balance of the sentence imposed by the United 
                States courts,
                    (C) to eliminate any requirement of prisoner 
                consent to such a transfer, and
                    (D) to allow the Federal Government or the States 
                to keep their original prison sentences in force so 
                that transferred prisoners who return to the United 
                States prior to the completion of their original United 
                States sentences can be returned to custody for the 
                balance of their prisons sentences;
            (2) the Secretary of State should give priority to 
        concluding an agreement with any country for which the 
        President determines that the number of aliens described in 
        subsection (a) who are nationals of that country in the United 
        States represents a significant percentage of all such aliens 
        in the United States; and
            (3) no new treaty providing for the transfer of aliens from 
        Federal, State, or local incarceration facilities to a foreign 
        incarceration facility should permit the alien to refuse the 
        transfer.
    (c) Prisoner Consent.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
except as required by treaty, the transfer of an alien from a Federal, 
State, or local incarceration facility under an agreement of the type 
referred to in subsection (a) shall not require consent of the alien.
    (d) Annual Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Attorney General 
shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House 
of Representatives and of the Senate stating whether each prisoner 
transfer treaty to which the United States is a party has been 
effective in the preceding 12 months in bringing about the return of 
deportable incarcerated aliens to the country of which they are 
nationals and in ensuring that they serve the balance of their 
sentences.
    (e) Training Foreign Law Enforcement Personnel.--(1) Subject to 
paragraph (2), the President shall direct the Border Patrol Academy and 
the Customs Service Academy to enroll for training an appropriate 
number of foreign law enforcement personnel, and shall make 
appointments of foreign law enforcement personnel to such academies, as 
necessary to further the following United States law enforcement goals:
            (A) prevention of drug smuggling and other cross-border 
        criminal activity;
            (B) preventing illegal immigration; and
            (C) preventing the illegal entry of goods into the United 
        States (including goods the sale of which is illegal in the 
        United States, the entry of which would cause a quota to be 
        exceeded, or which have not paid the appropriate duty or 
        tariff).
    (2) The appointments described in paragraph (1) shall be made only 
to the extent there is capacity in such academies beyond what is 
required to train United States citizens needed in the Border Patrol 
and Customs Service, and only of personnel from a country with which 
the prisoner transfer treaty has been stated to be effective in the 
most recent report referred to in subsection (d).
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.

        with, the treaties;
            (6) whether the recommendations under this subsection

stolen, or inapplicable to the person presenting the document, or

return to persecution, and the alien traveled from such country 
directly to the United States.
    ``(2) Notwithstanding subsection (a), an alien who boards a common 
carrier for the purpose of coming to the United States through the

is otherwise an alien subject to the special exclusion procedure of 
section 235(e), and the alien has indicated a desire to apply for 
asylum or for withholding of deportation under section 243(h), the

by video conference, to determine whether the alien has a credible fear 
of persecution (or of return to persecution) in or from--
            ``(i) the country of such alien's nationality or, in the 
        case of a person having no nationality, the country in which 
        such alien last habitually resided, and

procedure described in this paragraph to persons who may be eligible. 
An alien who is eligible for such procedure pursuant to subparagraph 
(A) may consult with a person or persons of the alien's choosing prior 
to the procedure or any review thereof, in accordance with regulations 
prescribed by the Attorney General. Such consultation shall be at no 
expense to the Government and shall not delay the process.

described in paragraph (5) to have a credible fear of persecution shall 
be taken before a special inquiry officer for a hearing in accordance

persecution' means that--

        statements and of country conditions, that the alien could 
        establish eligibility as a refugee within the meaning of 
        section 101(a)(42)(A).''.
