 [Struck out->]   `(g)(1) After notice and hearing, a court that enters an
 order confirming a plan of reorganization under chapter 11 may issue an
 injunction to supplement the injunctive effect of a discharge under this
 section. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) An injunction may be issued under paragraph (1) to
 enjoin persons and governmental units from taking legal action for the
 purpose of directly or indirectly collecting, recovering, or receiving
 payment or recovery of, on, or with respect to any claim or demand that,
 under a plan of reorganization, is to be paid in whole or in part by a trust
 described in paragraph (3)(A)(i), except such legal action as is expressly
 allowed by the injunction or plan of reorganization. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3)(A) If the requirements of subparagraph (B) are met,
 after entry of an injunction under paragraph (1) any proceeding that involves
 the validity, application, construction, or modification of the injunction
 or of this subsection in respect to the injunction may be commenced only
 in the district court in which the injunction was entered, and that  shall
 have exclusive jurisdiction over any such proceeding without regard to the
 amount in controversy. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B)  The requirements of this subparagraph are that--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) the injunction is to be implemented in connection
 with a trust that, pursuant to the plan of reorganization-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(I) is to be funded in whole or in part by the securities
 of a debtor involved in the plan of reorganization and by the obligation
 of the debtor to make future payments; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) is to own, or by the exercise of rights granted under
 the plan could own, a majority of the voting shares of each such debtor or
 of the parent corporation of each such debtor; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(III) will use its assets or income to pay claims and
 demands; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) the court finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(I) the debtor may be subject to substantial future demands
 for payment arising out of the same or similar conduct or events that gave
 rise to the claims that are addressed by the injunction; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) the actual amounts, numbers, and timing of such
 future demands cannot be determined; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(III) pursuit of such demands outside the procedures
 prescribed by the plan may threaten the plan's purpose to deal equitably
 with claims and future demands; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(IV)  as part of the process of seeking approval of
 the plan of reorganization, a separate class or classes of the claimants
 whose claims are to be addressed by a trust described in clause (i) is
 established and votes, by at least 90  percent of those voting, in favor
 of the plan. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4)(A) If the requirements of paragraph (3)(B) are met and
 the order approving the plan of reorganization was issued or affirmed by the
 district court that has jurisdiction over the reorganization proceedings,
 after the time for appeal of the order that issues or affirms the plan of
 reorganization-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) the injunction shall be valid and enforceable and may
 not be revoked or modified by any court except through appeal under paragraph
 (7); [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) no direct or indirect transferee of or successor to
 any assets of a debtor or trust that is the subject of the injunction shall
 be liable with respect to any claim or demand made against it by reason of
 its becoming such a transferee or successor;  and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iii) no entity that makes a loan to such a debtor or
 trust or to such a successor or transferee shall, by reason of making such
 loan, be liable with respect to any claim or demand made against it, nor
 shall any pledge of assets made in connection with such a loan be upset or
 impaired for that reason; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) Subparagraph (A) is not intended to-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) imply that such an entity would, if this paragraph
 were not applicable, have liability by reason of any of the acts described
 in subparagraph (A); [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) relieve any entity of the duty to comply with or
 relieve any person of liability under any Federal or State law regarding
 the making of a fraudulent conveyance; or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iii) relieve any debtor of its obligation to comply with
 the terms of the plan of reorganization or affect the power of the court
 to exercise its authority under sections 1141 and 1142 to compel the debtor
 to do so. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), an injunction issued
 under paragraph (1) shall be valid and enforceable against all entities
 and governmental units that it addresses. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) With respect to demand that is made subsequent to the
 confirmation of a plan against any debtor or trust that is the subject of
 an injunction issued under paragraph (1), the injunction shall be valid
 and enforceable if, as part of the proceedings leading to its issuance,
 the court appointed a legal representative for the purpose of protecting the
 rights of persons that might subsequently assert such a demand. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(6) In this subsection, the term `demand' means a demand
 for payment, present or future, that was not a claim within the meaning of
 section 101 during the proceedings leading to the confirmation of a plan
 of reorganization, but arises out of the same or similar conduct or events
 that gave rise to the claims addressed by the injunction, the payment of
 which demand, by a trust described in paragraph 3(A)(i), is provided for
 by the plan. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(7) Paragraph (5)(A) does not bar an action taken by or
 at the direction of an appellate court on appeal of an injunction issued
 under paragraph (1) or of the order of confirmation that relates to the
 injunction. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(8) This subsection governs any injunction entered before
 or after the date of enactment of this subsection. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(9) This subsection does not affect the operation of
 section 1144 or the power of the district court to refer  a proceeding
 under section 157 of title 28 or any reference  of a proceeding made prior
 to the date of enactment of this subsection. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(10) A debtor or trust that is the subject of an injunction
 issued under paragraph (1)-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) shall be deemed to be a settling and paying defendant
 in any Federal and State action arising out of the same or similar conduct
 or events that gave rise to the claims addressed by the injunction; and
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) shall be treated as such a defendant in accordance
 with State law generally applicable to defendants in personal injury tort
 actions. [<-Struck out]

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
  Congress finds that--
  (1) there was a record number of Federal bankruptcy filings for the calendar
  year of 1991;
  (2) the smooth and efficient operation of the bankruptcy system is vital
  to the continued growth and vitality of our Nation's economy;
  (3) debtors that file for bankruptcy are entitled and deserve full and
  complete information regarding the effects and consequences of filing
  for bankruptcy;
  (4) creditors of a debtor that files for bankruptcy deserve and need full
  and timely information regarding the circumstances of a debtor's bankruptcy
  filing; and
  (5) individual debtors, creditors, the bankruptcy system, and the national
  economy may be generally better served by the successful completion of a
  reorganization of debts under chapter 13 or a liquidation of debts under
  chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, depending upon the circumstances of each
  particular case; however, it is vital to the efficient operation of the
  bankruptcy system that each debtor consider and understand the consequences
  of both options.

  approve not to exceed 5 years, beginning on the date that the first payment
  is due under the plan, will be applied to make payments under the plan.

  (1) shall be valid and enforceable against all persons and governmental
  units that it addresses.
  `(B) With respect to a demand that is made subsequent to the confirmation
  of a plan against any debtor or trust that is the subject of an injunction
  issued under paragraph (1), the injunction shall be valid and enforceable
  if, as part of the proceedings leading to its issuance, the court appointed
  a legal representative for the purpose of protecting the rights of persons
  that might subsequently assert such a demand.

  present or future, that--

  (2)(B) the payment of which demand, by a trust described in paragraph
  (2)(A)(i), is provided for by the plan.
