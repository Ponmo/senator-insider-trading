                       Subtitle C--Missile Defense

SEC. 231. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Missile Defense Act of 1995''.

SEC. 232. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The threat that is posed to the national security of 
        the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and cruise 
        missiles is significant and growing, both quantitatively and 
        qualitatively.
            (2) The deployment of Theater Missile Defense systems will 
        deny potential adversaries the option of escalating a conflict 
        by threatening or attacking United States forces, coalition 
        partners of the United States, or allies of the United States 
        with ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction 
        to offset the operational and technical advantages of the 
        United States and its coalition partners and allies.
            (3) The intelligence community of the United States has 
        confirmed that (A) the missile proliferation trend is toward 
        longer range and more sophisticated ballistic missiles, (B) 
        North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile 
        capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within 5 years, and (C) 
        although a new indigenously developed ballistic missile threat 
        to the continental United States is not forecast within the 
        next 10 years there are ways for determined countries to 
        acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future 
        and with little warning by means other than indigenous 
        development.
            (4) The deployment by the United States and its allies of 
        effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges, as 
        well as against cruise missiles, will reduce the incentives for 
        countries to acquire such missiles or to augment existing 
        missile capabilities.
            (5) The Cold War distinction between strategic ballistic 
        missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles and, therefore, 
        the ABM Treaty's distinction between strategic defense and 
        nonstrategic defense, is technologically and geostrategically 
        outdated.
            (6) The concept of mutual assured destruction, which 
        provides the philosophical rationale for the ABM Treaty and 
        continued reliance on an offense-only form of deterrence, is 
        adversarial and bipolar in nature and is not a suitable basis 
        for stability in a multipolar world and one in which the United 
        States and the states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to 
        normalize relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and 
        arrangements.
            (7) By undermining the credibility of, and incentives to 
        pursue, destabilizing first-strike strategies, theater and 
        national missile defenses can contribute to the maintenance of 
        strategic stability as missile threats proliferate and as the 
        United States and the former Soviet Union significantly reduce 
        the
         number of strategic nuclear forces in their respective 
inventories.
            (8) Although technology control regimes and other forms of 
        international arms control can contribute to nonproliferation, 
        such measures are inadequate for dealing with missile 
        proliferation, and should not be viewed as alternatives to 
        missile defenses and other active and passive defenses.
            (9) Due to limitations in the ABM Treaty which preclude 
        deployment of more than 100 ground-based ABM interceptors at a 
        single site, the United States is currently prohibited from 
        deploying a national missile defense system capable of 
        defending the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii 
        against even the most limited ballistic missile attacks.

SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) deploy as soon as possible highly effective theater 
        missile defenses capable of countering existing and emerging 
        theater ballistic missiles;
            (2) deploy a multiple-site national missile defense system 
        that (A) is highly effective against limited ballistic missile 
        attacks on the territory of the United States, and (B) will be 
        augmented over time to provide a layered defense against larger 
        and more sophisticated ballistic missile threats;
            (3) improve existing cruise missile defenses and deploy as 
        soon as practical defenses that are highly effective against 
        advanced cruise missiles;
            (4) pursue a focused research and development program to 
        provide follow-on ballistic missile defense options;
            (5) employ streamlined acquisition procedures to lower the 
        cost and accelerate the pace of developing and deploying 
        theater missile defenses, cruise missile defenses, and national 
        missile defenses; and
            (6) seek a cooperative transition to a regime that does not 
        feature mutual assured destruction and an offense-only form of 
        deterrence as the basis for strategic stability.

SEC. 238. STANDARD FOR ASSESSING COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABM TREATY.

    (a) Policy Concerning Systems Subject to ABM Treaty.--Unless and 
until a missile defense or air defense system, system upgrade, or 
system component, including one that exploits data from space-based or 
other external sensors (such as the Space and Missile Tracking System, 
which can be deployed as an ABM adjunct, or the Navy's Cooperative 
Engagement Capability), is flight tested in an ABM-qualifying flight 
test (as defined in subsection (c)), such system, system upgrade, or 
system component--
            (1) has not, for purposes of the ABM Treaty, been tested in 
        an ABM mode nor been given capabilities to counter strategic 
        ballistic missiles; and
            (2) therefore is not subject to any application, 
        limitation, or obligation under the ABM Treaty.
    (b) Prohibitions.--(1) Appropriated funds may not be obligated or 
expended by any official of the Federal Government for the purpose of--
            (A) prescribing, enforcing, or implementing any Executive 
        order, regulation, or policy that would apply the ABM Treaty 
        (or any limitation or obligation under such Treaty) to 
        research, development, testing, or deployment of a missile 
        defense or air defense system, system upgrade, or system 
        component, including one that exploits data from space-based or 
        other external sensors; or
            (B) taking any other action to provide for the ABM Treaty 
        (or any limitation or obligation under such treaty) to be 
        applied to research, development, testing, or deployment of a 
        missile defense or air defense system, system upgrade, or 
        system component, including one that exploits data from space-
        based or other external sensors.
    (2) This subsection shall cease to apply with respect to a missile 
defense or air defense system, system upgrade, or system component, 
including one that exploits data from space-based or other external 
sensors, when that system, system upgrade, or system component has been 
flight tested in an ABM-qualifying flight test.
    (c) ABM-Qualifying Flight Test Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, an ABM-qualifying flight test is a flight test against a 
ballistic missile which, in that flight test, exceeds (1) a range of 
3,500 kilometers, or (2) a velocity of 5 kilometers per second.
    (d) Actions of the Secretary of Defense.--Not later than 60 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter 
in the annual report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, the 
Secretary of Defense shall certify to Congress that no United States 
missile defense or air defense system, system upgrade, or system 
component is being limited, modified, or otherwise constrained pursuant 
to the ABM Treaty in a manner that is inconsistent with this section.
    (e) Congressional Review of Range and Velocity Parameters.--
Congress finds that the range and velocity parameters set forth in 
subsection (c) are based on a distinction between strategic and 
nonstrategic ballistic missiles that is technically and 
geostrategically outdated, and, therefore, should be subject to review 
and change as part of the Senate's comprehensive review under section 
237.

environmental protection, such State may completely prohibit any 
discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, whether 
treated or not, into such waters. No such prohibition shall apply until 
the Administrator determines that
 adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal of such 
discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel are reasonably 
available for the waters to which such prohibition would apply. Upon 
application of the State, the Administrator shall make such 
determination within 90 days of the date of such application.
    ``(B) If the Administrator determines upon application of a State 
that the protection and enhancement of the quality of specified waters 
within such State require such a prohibition, the Administrator shall 
by regulation completely prohibit the discharge from a vessel of such 
discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel into such 
waters.
    ``(C) To the extent prohibitions arising under this paragraph would 
apply to vessels of the Armed Forces and not to other types of vessels, 
the application submitted by the State shall discuss and document the 
technical or environmental basis for such distinction. No prohibition 
under this paragraph may be approved which would discriminate against 
vessels of the Armed Forces by reason of their ownership or operation 
by the Federal Government or their military function.
    ``(D)(i) Laws and regulations establishing prohibitions under this 
paragraph shall not impose design, construction, manning, or equipment 
standards on foreign flagged vessels engaged in innocent passage unless 
giving effect to generally accepted international rules or standards.

paragraph relating to the prevention, reduction, and control of 
pollution shall not apply to foreign flagged vessels engaged in transit 
passage unless giving effect to applicable international regulations 
regarding the discharge of oil, oily wastes, or other noxious 
substances.

hereunder shall be enforceable, as provided in subsections (j) and (k), 
against agencies of the United States responsible for vessels of the 
Armed Forces notwithstanding any immunity of such agency.''.
    (b) Cooperation in Standards Development.--To assist the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary 
of Defense in determining the nature and environmental effect of 
incidental discharges from vessels of the Armed Forces, the 
practicability of using marine pollution control devices in vessels of 
the Armed Forces, and the effect that installation or use of marine 
pollution control devices in vessels of the Armed Forces would have on 
the operations or operational capability of such vessels, and to assist 
the Administrator and the Secretary in setting performance standards 
for marine pollution control devices in vessels of the Armed Forces, 
the Administrator and the Secretary may, by agreement with the other, 
with or without reimbursement, utilize information, reports, personnel, 
or other resources of the Environmental Protection Agency or the 
Department of Defense.

prescribe the rate on the basis of the best available estimate of risk 
and financial exposure, levels of subscription by members, and other 
relevant factors.

year of insurance coverage of an insured member shall be continued 
without change for subsequent years of insurance coverage, except that

payment due under this chapter. The advance may be paid out of 
appropriations for military pay. An advance to a member shall be

amount from basic pay payable for the member or by collecting it from 
the member directly. No disbursing or certifying officer shall be 
responsible for any loss resulting from an advance under this 
subsection.
    ``(c) Premiums To Be Deposited in Fund.--Premium amounts deducted

actuarially sound basis.
    ``(b) Assets of Fund.--There shall be deposited into the Fund the 
following:
            ``(1) Premiums paid under section 12527 of this title.

            ``(3) Any return on investment of the assets of the Fund.
    ``(c) Availability.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available for 
paying insurance benefits under the insurance program.
    ``(d) Investment of Assets of Fund.--The Secretary of the Treasury 
shall invest such portion of the Fund as is not in the judgment of the 
Secretary of Defense required to meet current liabilities. Such 
investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable 
to the needs of the Fund, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, 
and bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on 
outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable 
maturities. The income on such investments shall be credited to the 
Fund.
    ``(e) Annual Accounting.--At the beginning of each fiscal year, the 
Secretary, in consultation with the Board of Actuaries and the 
Secretary of the Treasury, shall determine the following:
            ``(1) The projected amount of the premiums to be collected, 
        investment earnings to be received, and any transfers or 
        appropriations to be made for the Fund for that fiscal year.
            ``(2) The amount for that fiscal year of any cumulative 
        unfunded liability (including any negative amount or any gain 
        to the Fund) resulting from payments of benefits.

        the Fund.

the actuarial responsibility for the insurance program.
    ``(b) Valuations and Premium Recommendations.--The Board of 
Actuaries shall carry out periodic actuarial valuations of the benefits 
under the insurance program and determine a premium rate methodology 
for the Secretary to use in setting premium rates for the insurance 
program. The Board shall conduct the first valuation and determine a 
premium rate methodology not later than six months after the insurance 
program is established.
    ``(c) Effects of Changed Benefits.--If at the time of any actuarial 
valuation under subsection (b) there has been a change in benefits 
under the insurance program that has been made since the last such 
valuation and such change in benefits increases or decreases the 
present value of amounts payable from the Fund, the Board of Actuaries 
shall determine a premium rate methodology, and recommend to the 
Secretary a premium schedule, for the liquidation of any liability (or 
actuarial gain to the Fund) resulting from such change and any previous 
such changes so that the present value of the sum of the scheduled 
premium payments (or reduction in payments that would otherwise be 
made) equals the cumulative increase (or decrease) in the present value 
of such benefits.
    ``(d) Actuarial Gains or Losses.--If at the time of any such 
valuation the Board of Actuaries determines that there has been an 
actuarial gain or loss to the Fund as a result of changes in actuarial 
assumptions since the last valuation or as a result of any differences, 
between actual and expected experience since the last valuation, the 
Board shall recommend to the Secretary a premium rate schedule for the 
amortization of the cumulative gain or loss to the Fund resulting from 
such changes in assumptions and any previous such changes in 
assumptions or from the differences in actual and expected experience, 
respectively, through an increase or decrease in the payments that 
would otherwise be made to the Fund.
    ``(e) Insufficient Assets.--If at any time liabilities of the Fund 
exceed assets of the Fund as a result of members of the Ready Reserve 
being ordered to active duty as described in section 12521(2) of this 
title, and funds are unavailable to pay benefits completely, the 
Secretary shall request the President to submit to Congress a request 
for a special appropriation to cover the unfunded liability. If 
appropriations are not made to cover an unfunded liability in any 
fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the benefits paid 
under the insurance program to a total amount that does not exceed the 
assets of the Fund expected to accrue by the end of such fiscal year. 
Benefits that cannot be paid because of such a reduction shall be 
deferred and may be paid only after and to the extent that additional 
funds become available.

define the term `present value' for purposes of this subsection.
``Sec. 12530. Payment of benefits

regulations the manner in which payments shall be made to the member or 
to a person designated in accordance with subsection (c).

another person (including a spouse, parent, or other person with an

under the insurance program.
    ``(2) A member may direct that payments of insurance benefits for a 
person designated under paragraph (1) be deposited with a bank or other 
financial institution to the credit of the designated person.
    ``(d) Recipients in Event of Death of Insured Member.--Any 
insurance payable under the insurance program on account of a deceased 
member's period of covered service shall be paid, upon the

which the deceased member designated in writing. If no such designation 
has been made, the amount shall be payable in accordance with the laws 
of the State of the member's domicile.
``Sec. 12531. Purchase of insurance
    ``(a) Purchase Authorized.--The Secretary may, instead of or in 
addition to underwriting the insurance program through the Fund, 
purchase from one or more insurance companies a policy or policies of 
group insurance in order to provide the benefits required under this 
chapter. The Secretary may waive any requirement for full and open 
competition in order to purchase an insurance policy under this 
subsection.
    ``(b) Eligible Insurers.--In order to be eligible to sell insurance 
to the Secretary for purposes of subsection (a), an insurance company

issues a policy for purposes of subsection (a) shall establish an 
administrative office at a place and under a name designated by the 
Secretary.
    ``(2) For the purposes of carrying out this chapter, the Secretary 
may use the facilities and services of any insurance company issuing 
any policy for purposes of subsection (a), may designate one such 
company as the representative of the other companies for such purposes, 
and may contract to pay a reasonable fee to the designated company for 
its services.
    ``(d) Reinsurance.--The Secretary shall arrange with each insurance 
company issuing any policy for purposes of subsection (a) to reinsure, 
under conditions approved by the Secretary, portions of the total 
amount of the insurance under such policy or policies with such other 
insurance companies (which meet qualifying criteria prescribed by the 
Secretary) as may elect to participate in such reinsurance.

SEC. 542. MERITORIOUS AND VALOROUS SERVICE DURING VIETNAM ERA: REVIEW 
              AND AWARDS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign, carried out by 
        the Armed Forces of the United States in the Ia Drang Valley of 
        Vietnam from October 23, 1965, to November 26, 1965, is 
        illustrative of the many battles which pitted forces of the 
        United States against North Vietnamese Army regulars and Viet 
        Cong in vicious fighting in which many members of the Armed 
        Forces displayed extraordinary heroism, sacrifice, and bravery 
        which has not yet been officially recognized through award of 
        appropriate decorations.
            (2) Accounts of these battles published since the war ended 
        authoritatively document repeated acts of extraordinary 
        heroism, sacrifice, and bravery on the part of many members of 
        the Armed Forces who were engaged in these battles, many of 
        whom have never been officially recognized for those acts.
            (3) In some of the battles United States military units 
        suffered substantial losses, in some cases a majority of the 
        strength of the units.
            (4) The incidence of heavy casualties throughout the war 
        inhibited the timely collection of comprehensive and detailed 
        information to support recommendations for awards for the acts 
        of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery performed.
            (5) Requests to the Secretaries of the military departments 
        for review of award recommendations for those acts have been 
        denied because of restrictions in law and regulations that 
        require timely filing of recommendations and documented 
        justification.
            (6) Acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery performed in 
        combat by members of the Armed Forces of the United States 
        deserve appropriate and timely recognition by the people of the 
        United States.
            (7) It is appropriate to recognize military personnel for 
        acts of extraordinary heroism, sacrifice, or bravery that are 
        belatedly, but properly, documented by persons who witnessed 
        those acts.
    (b) Waiver of Restrictions on Awards.--(1) Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of 
the military department concerned may award a decoration to any person 
for an act, an achievement, or service that the person performed in a 
campaign while serving on active duty during the Vietnam era.
    (2) Paragraph (1) applies to any decoration (including any device 
in lieu of a decoration) that, during or after the Vietnam era and 
before the date of the enactment of this Act, was authorized by law or 
under regulations of the Department of Defense or the military 
department concerned to be awarded to a person for an act, an 
achievement, or service performed by that person while serving on 
active duty.
    (c) Review of Award Recommendations.--(1) The Secretary of each 
military department shall review all recommendations for awards for 
acts, achievements, or service described in subsection (b)(1) that have 
been received by the Secretary during the period of the review.
    (2) The Secretaries shall begin the review within 30 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act and shall complete the review within 
one year after such date.
    (3) The Secretary may use the same process for carrying out the 
review as the Secretary uses for reviewing other recommendations for 
awarding decorations to members of the armed force or armed forces 
under the Secretary's jurisdiction for acts, achievements, or service.
    (4)(A) Upon completing the review, the Secretary shall submit a 
report on the review to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate 
and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives.
    (B) The report shall contain the following information on each 
recommendation for award reviewed:
            (i) A summary of the recommendation.
            (ii) The findings resulting from the review.
            (iii) The final action taken on the recommendation.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``Vietnam era'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 101(29) of title 38, United States Code.
            (2) The term ``active duty'' has the meaning given such 
        term in section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the

        military intelligence duties during the period beginning 
        January 1, 1940, and ending December 31, 1990, in order to 
        determine--
                    (A) whether, by reason of the secrecy associated 
                with the performance of such duties, any of such 
                personnel have not been considered or fully considered 
                before the date of the enactment of this Act for 
                decorations and awards for the performance of such 
                duties during that period; and
                    (B) whether, without regard to applicable time 
                limitations, any of such personnel should be considered 
                for decorations or awards in recognition of the manner 
                in which the personnel performed such duties or the 
                achievements attained in performing such duties; and
            (2) should consider, in particular, any recommendation for 
        a decoration or award for any of such personnel that--
                    (A) is based on the manner in which the personnel 
                performed such duties or the achievements attained in 
                performing such duties; and
                    (B) is received within one year after the date of 
                the enactment of this Act.
    (b) Waiver of Time Limitations.--The Secretary of a military 
department may approve a decoration or award for any personnel referred 
to in subsection (a) in accordance with the sense of Congress set forth 
in that subsection without regard to any of the following restrictions:
            (1) The following provisions of title 10, United States 
        Code:
                    (A) Section 3744(d).

                    (C) Section 8744(d).

        to ensure that covered beneficiaries who are eligible for 
        medicare under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and who reside in a region in which the 
        TRICARE program has been implemented have adequate access to 
        health care services after the implementation of the TRICARE 
        program in that region; and
            (2) to support strongly, as a means of ensuring such 
        access, the reimbursement of the Department of Defense by the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services for health care services 
        provided such beneficiaries at the medical treatment facilities

services. The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program in one region 
in which the TRICARE program has been implemented as of the beginning

    (b) Wraparound Services Defined.--For purposes of this section, 
wraparound services are individualized mental health services that a 
provider provides, principally in a residential setting but also with 
follow-up services, in return for payment on a case rate basis. For 
payment of the case rate for a patient, the provider incurs the risk 
that it will be necessary for the provider to provide the patient with 
additional mental health services intermittently or on a longer term 
basis after completion of the services provided on a residential basis 
under a treatment plan.
    (c) Pilot Program Agreement.--Under the pilot program the Secretary 
of Defense shall enter into an agreement with a provider of mental 
health services that requires the provider--
            (1) to provide wraparound services to covered beneficiaries 
        referred to in subsection (a);
            (2) to continue to provide such services to each 
        beneficiary as needed during the period of the agreement even 
        if the patient relocates outside the TRICARE program region 
        involved (but inside the United States) during that period; and
            (3) to accept as payment for such services an amount not in 
        excess of the amount of the standard CHAMPUS residential 
        treatment clinic benefit payable with respect to the covered 
        beneficiary concerned (as determined in accordance with section 
        8.1 of chapter 3 of volume II of the CHAMPUS policy manual).
    (d) Report.--Not later than March 1, 1997, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a report 
on the program carried out under this section. The report shall 
contain--
            (1) an assessment of the effectiveness of the program; and
            (2) the Secretary's views regarding whether the program 
        should be implemented in all regions where the TRICARE program

SEC. 1052. NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF UNITED STATES EXPORT 
              CONTROL POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Export controls remain an important element of the 
        national security policy of the United States.
            (2) It is in the national interest that United States 
        export control policy prevent the transfer, to potential 
        adversaries or combatants of the United States, of technology 
        that threatens the national security or defense of the United 
        States.
            (3) It is in the national interest that the United States 
        monitor aggressively the export of technology in order to 
        prevent its diversion to potential adversaries or combatants of 
        the United States.
            (4) The Department of Defense relies increasingly on 
        commercial and dual-use technologies, products, and processes 
        to support United States military capabilities and economic

        applications for the export of commodities whose export is 
        controlled for national security reasons if such commodities 
        are exported to certain countries, but the Department does not 
        evaluate license applications for the export of such 
        commodities if such commodities are exported to other

        technologies that are critical to the military capabilities of

        and technologies, and should reevaluate the export control 
        policy of the United States in light of such identification; 
        and
            (3) the Government should utilize unilateral export 
        controls on dual-use items and technologies that are critical 
        to the military capabilities of the Armed Forces (regardless of 
        the availability of such items or technologies overseas) with 
        respect to the countries that--
                    (A) pose a threat to the national security 
                interests of the United States; and

SEC. 1058. INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to promote military professionalism (including an 
        understanding of and respect for the proper role of the 
        military in a civilian-led democratic society), the effective 
        management of defense resources, the recognition of 
        internationally recognized human rights, and an effective 
        military justice system within the armed forces of allies of 
        the United States and of countries friendly to the United 
        States;
            (2) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to foster rapport, understanding, and cooperation 
        between the Armed Forces of the United States and the armed 
        forces of allies of the United States and of countries friendly 
        to the United States;
            (3) the international military education and training 
        program is a low-cost method of promoting
         military professionalism within the armed forces of allies of 
the United States and of countries friendly to the United States and 
fostering better relations between the Armed Forces of the United 
States and those armed forces;
            (4) the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact 
        alliance and the spread of democracy in the Western Hemisphere 
        have created an opportunity to promote the military 
        professionalism of the armed forces of the affected nations;
            (5) funding for the international military education and 
        training program of the United States has decreased 
        dramatically in recent years;
            (6) the decrease in funding for the international military 
        education and training program has resulted in a major decrease 
        in the participation of personnel from Asia, Latin America, and 
        Africa in the program;
            (7) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
        commanders in chief of the regional combatant commands have 
        consistently testified before congressional committees that the 
        international military education and training program fosters 
        cooperation with and improves military management, civilian 
        control over the military forces, and respect for human rights 
        within foreign military forces; and
            (8) the delegation by the President to the Secretary of 
        Defense of authority to perform functions relating to the 
        international military education and training program is 
        appropriate and should be continued.
    (b) Activities Authorized.--(1) Part I of subtitle A of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:

        agreement.
    (2) The limitation in paragraph (1) does not apply to a use of 
funds to fulfill a policy of the United States to reimburse expenses 
incurred by another party to an arms control agreement if--
            (A) the policy does not modify any obligation imposed by 
        the arms control agreement;
            (B) the President--
                    (i) issued or approved the policy before the date 
                of the enactment of this Act; or
                    (ii) has entered into an agreement on the policy 
                with the government of another country or has approved 
                an agreement on the policy entered into by an official

        control treaty or other form of international arms control 
        agreement.
            (2) The term ``executive agreement'' is an international 
        agreement entered into by the President that is not authorized 
        by statute or approved by the Senate under Article II, section 
        2, clause 2 of the Constitution.

SEC. 1061. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LIMITING THE PLACING OF UNITED STATES 
              FORCES UNDER UNITED NATIONS COMMAND OR CONTROL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the President has made United Nations peace operations 
        a major component of the foreign and security policies of the 
        United States;
            (2) the President has committed United States military 
        personnel under United Nations operational control to missions 
        in Haiti, Croatia, and Macedonia that could endanger those 
        personnel;
            (3) the President has committed the United States to deploy 
        as many as 25,000 military personnel to Bosnia-Herzegovina as 
        peacekeepers under United Nations command and control in the 
        event that the parties to that conflict reach a peace 
        agreement;
            (4) although the President has insisted that he will retain 
        command of United States forces at all times, in the past this 
        has meant administrative control of United States forces only, 
        while operational control has been ceded to United Nations 
        commanders, some of whom were foreign nationals;
            (5) the experience of United States forces participating in 
        combined United States-United Nations operations in Somalia, 
        and in combined United Nations-NATO operations in the former 
        Yugoslavia, demonstrate that prerequisites for effective 
        military operations such as unity of command and clarity of 
        mission have not been met by United Nations command and control 
        arrangements; and
            (6) despite the many deficiencies in the conduct of United 
        Nations peace operations, there may be occasions when it is in 
        the national security interests of the United States to 
        participate in such operations.
    (b) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should consult closely with Congress 
        regarding any United Nations peace operation that could involve 
        United States combat forces, and that such consultations should 
        continue throughout the duration of such activities;
            (2) the President should consult with Congress prior to a 
        vote within the United Nations Security Council on any 
        resolution which would authorize, extend, or revise the 
        mandates for such activities;
            (3) in view of the complexity of United Nations peace 
        operations and the difficulty of achieving unity of command and 
        expeditious decisionmaking, the United States should 
        participate in such operations only when it is clearly in the 
        national security interest to do so;
            (4) United States combat forces should be under the 
        operational control of qualified commanders and should have 
        clear and effective command and control arrangements and rules 
        of engagement (which do not restrict their self-defense in any 
        way) and clear and unambiguous mission statements; and
            (5) none of the Armed Forces of the United States should be 
        under the operational control of foreign nationals in United 
        Nations peace enforcement operations except in the most 
        extraordinary circumstances.
    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            (1) the term ``United Nations peace enforcement 
        operations'' means any international peace enforcement or 
        similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations 
        Security Council under chapter VII of the Charter of the United 
        Nations; and
            (2) the term ``United Nations peace operations'' means any 
        international peacekeeping, peacemaking, peace enforcement, or 
        similar activity that is authorized by the United Nations 
        Security Council under chapter VI or VII of the Charter of the 
        United Nations.

                a safe and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile to the 
                national security of the United States;
                    (B) growing concern with the Department of Energy's 
                management of the nuclear weapons stockpile; and
                    (C) proposed legislative initiatives which seek 
                extensive changes to the present organization and 
                existence of the Department of Energy, which could 
                impact the nuclear weapons stockpile of the United 
                States; and
            (2) to direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of

            (2) the national security strategy of the United States is 
        fundamentally based on the continued safety and reliability of 
        the nuclear weapons stockpile;
            (3) it is essential that the United States act decisively 
        to restore the capacity to remanufacture nuclear weapons at a 
        rate sufficient to sustain the stockpile at levels consistent 
        with relevant treaty limits and to maintain the safety and 
        reliability of the stockpile and the safety and performance of 
        the nuclear weapons complex;
            (4) there is a growing concern that the Department of 
        Energy is not focusing sufficient resources and management 
        attention to its defense-related mission, comprised

Numbered 1. In making their assessments, the independent experts shall 
consider (among other factors) all equipment and facilities to be 
included in the sale, the estimated quantity of petroleum and natural 
gas in the reserve, and the net present value of the anticipated 
revenue stream that the Secretary and the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget jointly determine the Treasury would receive from 
the reserve if the reserve were not sold, adjusted for any anticipated 
increases in tax revenues that would result if the reserve were sold. 
The independent experts shall complete their assessments within six 
months after the effective date.
    ``(B) The independent experts shall also determine and submit to 
the Secretary the estimated total amount of the cost of any 
environmental restoration and remediation necessary at the reserve. The

(A).
    ``(3) Not later than two months after the effective date, the 
Secretary shall retain the services of an investment banker to 
independently administer, in a manner consistent with commercial 
practices and in a manner that maximizes sale proceeds to the

            ``(i) all equipment and facilities to be included in the 
        sale; and
            ``(ii) any potential claim or liability (including 
        liability for environmental restoration and remediation), and 
        the extent of any such claim or liability, for which the United 
        States is responsible under subsection (d).

    ``(7) The Secretary shall take such action immediately after the 
effective date as is necessary to obtain from an independent petroleum 
engineer within six months after that date a certification regarding 
the quantity of the content of the reserve. The Secretary shall use the 
certification in support of the preparation of the invitation for bids.
    ``(d) Future Liabilities.--The United States shall hold harmless 
and fully indemnify the purchaser of the interest of the United States 
in Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 from and against any claim or 
liability as a result of ownership in the reserve by the United States, 
including any claim referred to in subsection (e).
    ``(e) Treatment of State of California Claim.--After the costs 
incurred in the conduct of the sale of Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 
1 under this section are deducted, seven percent of the remaining 
proceeds from the sale of the reserve shall be reserved in a contingent 
fund in the Treasury (for a period not to exceed 10 years after the 
effective date) for payment to the State of California in the event 
that, and to the extent that, the claims of the State against the 
United States regarding production and proceeds of sale from Naval 
Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 are resolved in favor of the State by a 
court of competent jurisdiction. Funds in the contingent fund shall be 
available for paying any such claim to the extent provided in 
appropriation Acts. After final disposition of the claims, any

    ``(f) Maintaining Elk Hills Unit Production.--Until the sale of 
Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 is completed under this section, the 
Secretary shall continue to produce the reserve at the maximum daily 
oil or gas rate from a reservoir, which will permit maximum economic 
development of the reservoir consistent with sound oil field 
engineering practices in accordance with section 3 of the unit plan 
contract. The definition of maximum efficient rate in section 7420(6) 
of this title shall not apply to the reserve.

Reserve Numbered 1, the sale of the interest of the United States in 
the reserve shall be subject to the contract for a period of three 
months after the closing date of the sale or until termination of the

 of any contract entered into after the effective date for the purchase 
of such production shall not exceed the anticipated closing date for 
the sale of the reserve.

provided in the contract between the United States and Bechtel 
Petroleum Operation, Inc., Contract Number DE-ACO1-85FE60520 so that 
the contract terminates not later than the date of closing of the sale 
of Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 under subsection (c).

provided in the unit plan contract so that the unit plan contract 
terminates not later than the date of closing of the sale of reserve.

construed to alter the application of the antitrust laws of the United 
States to the purchaser of Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 or to the 
lands in the reserve subject to sale under this section upon the 
completion of the sale.
    ``(i) Preservation of Private Right, Title, and Interest.--Nothing 
in this section shall be construed to adversely affect the ownership 
interest of any other entity having any right, title, and interest in 
and to lands within the boundaries of Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 
1 and which are subject to the unit plan contract.

Senate and the Committees on National Security and on Commerce of the 
House of Representatives a notification of that determination together 
with a plan setting forth the actions that will be taken to ensure that
