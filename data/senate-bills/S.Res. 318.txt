SRES 318 ES
S. Res. 318
In the Senate of the United States,
August 1 (legislative day, July 10), 1990.
Whereas Iraq during the 1980's, under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, has
demonstrated a blatant disregard for international law and all standards of
human decency, building a heinous record of atrocity and carnage;
Whereas in 1980 Iraq's invasion of Iran began the Iran-Iraq war, which became
one of history's bloodiest;
Whereas, beginning in 1983, Iraq initiated and made extensive use of chemical
weapons in the Iran-Iraq war;
Whereas this chemical slaughter constituted the most significant violation
of the Geneva Protocol in the 65-year history of that international treaty,
to which Iraq is a party;
Whereas Iraq's use of chemical weapons culminated in 1988 in a massive attack
on its own Kurdish minority, causing tens of thousands of deaths and more
than 65,000 refugees;
Whereas Iraq may be proceeding to develop biological weapons in violation of
the 1972 international convention prohibiting the manufacture or possession
of such weapons;
Whereas Iraq has continued illegal efforts to acquire nuclear weapons
technology in violation of United States export laws and Iraq's obligations
under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty;
Whereas the Iraqi effort to develop an indigenous ballistic missile capability
represents an additional dimension of Iraq's threat to the Persian Gulf region;
Whereas, domestically, Iraq's human rights record is one   of continuing
barbarism, characterized by arbitrary imprisonment, government-sanctioned
murder, and even the torture, mutilation, and killing of children as a means
of terror against their parents;
Whereas Iraq's efforts  to eradicate Kurds and depopulate the Kurdish regions
of Iraq are tantamount to a policy of genocide;
Whereas Iraq stands in flagrant violation of its obligations under the United
Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
Whereas, in 1988, in response to Iraq's use of chemical weapons against
the Kurds, the United States Senate on three occasions passed legislation
imposing comprehensive sanctions against Iraq;
Whereas, on July 27 this year, the Senate passed the Iraq International Law
Compliance Act in a continuing effort to secure Iraqi compliance with the
rule of law;
Whereas in recent days Iraq mobilized forces  on its border with Kuwait,
issuing a series of bellicose threats, aimed not only at Kuwait but also at
Israel and the United Arab Emirates;
Whereas Iraq, on August 1, without provocation and under contrived pretense,
invaded the sovereign nation of Kuwait, seizing control of its capital and
all national territory;
Whereas the President, on August 2, issued an executive order freezing Iraqi
and Kuwaiti assets in the United States, and embargoing all trade with Iraq;
Whereas Iraq's military power in the Persian Gulf area is virtually
unchallenged, and its record  of callous brutality, opportunism, and
belligerency demonstrates that no policy of appeasement or cooperation will
constrain the threat Iraq now poses to the security of nations throughout the
entire Persian Gulf region and to the international order: Now, therefore,
be it
  Resolved, That Congress commends the President for his initial actions and
  urges the President to act immediately, using unilateral and multilateral
  measures, to seek the full and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces
  from Kuwaiti territory; and, specifically to:
  (1) Proceed to enforce against Iraq, unilaterally, all provisions of United
  States law, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,
  to impose--
  (A) sanctions against a country engaged in a consistent pattern of gross
  violations of internationally recognized human rights,
  (B) a sustained freeze of all Iraqi assets, and
  (C) a sustained ban on any export  of United States goods and services to
  Iraq; and
  (2) Undertake, multilaterally, a concerted diplomatic effort, through
  the United Nations Security Council and all other available channels,
  to achieve collective international sanctions against Iraq, to include--
  (A) a cessation of all arms shipments and all transfer of military technology
  to Iraq, with emphasis on--
  (i) all Soviet-supplied arms and spare parts, as promised by the Soviet
  Union immediately after Iraq's invasion;
  (ii) all arms and spare parts supplied by other major suppliers; and
  (iii) all material and technical assistance from any source that could
  contribute to the development or employment of ballistic missiles and
  nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons;
  (B) a cessation of trade with Iraq and a worldwide freeze on Iraqi and
  Kuwaiti assets;
  (C) a suspension of all economic development activities within Iraq,
  with emphasis on--
  (i) oil development activities; and
  (ii) construction and other projects supported by American, European,
  and Japanese industry;
  (D) the imposition, under Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, a full
  economic blockade against Iraq; and
  (E) if such measures prove inadequate to secure Iraq's withdrawal from
  Kuwait, additional multilateral actions, under Article 42 of the United
  Nations Charter, involving air, sea, and land forces as may be needed to
  maintain or restore international peace and security in the region.
