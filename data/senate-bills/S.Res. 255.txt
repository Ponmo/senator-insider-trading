SRES 255 ES
S. Res. 255
In the Senate of the United States,
March 1 (legislative day, January 23), 1990.
Whereas, the American public is now witnessing the end of the second week
of the spring training lockout in baseball;
Whereas the economics of those communities that host spring training are
suffering major economic losses as a result of baseball owners and players
inability to agree and begin the season;
Whereas cities with Major League Baseball franchises now risk similar serious
economic losses if the disagreement continues;
Whereas Major League Baseball enjoys a unique and privileged treatment under
Federal law;
Whereas the American people do not believe the inability to resolve these
disputes should deny the American people the opportunity to see a complete
spring training and regular season of the National Pastime; and
Whereas, in addition to representing the interests of owners and players,
the negotiators in this dispute have an obligation to baseball fans, who
through their enthusiasm, attendance, and willingness to pay to view the
game, provide benefits to both owners, players, and the host communities:
Now therefore, be it
  Resolved, That the baseball owners, players, and their negotiators settle
  their differences promptly and begin a complete spring training and regular
  season as soon as possible.
Attest:
Secretary.
