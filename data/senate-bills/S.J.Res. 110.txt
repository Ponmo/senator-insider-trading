JOINT RESOLUTION
Expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States and the Soviet
Union should lead an effort to promptly repeal United Nations General Assembly
Resolution 3379 (XXX).
Whereas United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 (XXX), which equates
Zionism with racism--
  (a) has been unhelpful in the context of the search for a settlement in
  the Middle East;
  (b) is inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations;
  (c) remains unacceptable as a misrepresentation of Zionism; and,
  (d) has served to escalate religious animosity and incite anti-Semitism;
Whereas the United States vigorously opposed the adoption of Resolution 3379
and has never acquiesced to its content;
Whereas the Soviet Union vigorously supported the adoption of Resolution
3379 but has now stated that it no longer supports the resolution; and
Whereas the Soviet Union has expressed a desire to participate in the search
for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and should demonstrate its
commitment to peace by working to repeal Resolution 3379: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That the United States and the Soviet
  Union should lead an effort to promptly repeal United Nations General
  Assembly Resolution 3379 (XXX).
