 achieving excellence deserves public recognition. [<-Struck out]

 and reward public and private elementary and secondary schools that have
 made substantial progress in-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) raising student educational achievement; [<-Struck out]

 [Struck out->] `SELECTION OF PRESIDENTIAL MERIT SCHOOLS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4708. (a) ELIGIBLE SCHOOLS- (1) A State educational
 agency may designate as a Merit School any public or private elementary or
 secondary school in the State that has been nominated through procedures
 established by such agency. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) In selecting Presidential Merit Schools, each State
 educational agency shall apply the selection criteria uniformly to public
 and private schools. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY SECRETARY- (1) The Secretary
 shall establish minimum criteria to be used by every State educational
 agency in selecting Presidential Merit Schools. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) The criteria established by the Secretary shall
 address-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) progress in improving educational performance, with
 particular emphasis on mastery of reading, writing, and mathematics skills;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) the degree to which the school demonstrates progress
 in achieving and maintaining a safe environment, including reduction or
 elimination of problems related to drug and alcohol use; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) progress in reducing the number of students who drop
 out of school or in encouraging those who have dropped out to reenter school
 and complete their schooling. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(c) STATE CRITERIA- (1) Based on the selection criteria
 established by the Secretary, as required by subsection (b), each State
 educational agency shall establish additional criteria that measure progress
 in such areas as-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) student achievement, as measured by such factors
 as year-to-year improvement in test scores, college entrance rates, and
 employment of graduates in jobs with significant potential for career
 development; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) other indicators of a school's success, such as
 improvements in school leadership, the teaching and learning environment,
 and parental and community support and involvement. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) In setting criteria for Presidential Merit Schools,
 the State educational agency may establish standards that recognize the
 composition of the student body and other relevant factors, and that give
 special consideration to schools with substantial numbers or proportions
 of children from low-income families. The State educational agency may also
 set different criteria for different grade levels. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) In applying the criteria to a school in which a
 program is conducted under part A of chapter 1 of title I of this Act, the
 State educational agency shall consider the desired outcomes identified for
 children in the application submitted under section 1012(b) of this Act by
 the local educational agency operating the school. No school that a local
 educational agency has identified under section 1021(b) of this Act shall
 be eligible for a Presidential Merit School award. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) In selecting Presidential Merit Schools and in setting
 the amount of their awards, the State educational agency may not consider
 a school's planned use of a Presidential Merit School award. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(d) AMOUNT OF AWARD- Each State educational agency shall
 establish criteria, subject to subsection (c)(4), including criteria relating
 to the size of the school and the economic circumstances of the student body,
 for determining the amount of Presidential Merit School awards. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(e) BYPASS- If a State educational agency is either
 prohibited by State law from providing funds made available under this part
 to private schools, or is unwilling to do so, it shall notify the Secretary
 of such prohibition or unwillingness, as well as the private schools it has
 designated as Presidential Merit Schools and the amount of their awards. The
 Secretary shall then provide those funds, from the State's allocation under
 this part, to the designated private schools, through such arrangements as
 the Secretary finds suitable. The Secretary shall also withhold from the
 State's allocation under this part the administrative costs of making such
 arrangements. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATES OF MERIT [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4709. Each Presidential Merit School shall be awarded
 a Presidential Certificate of Merit. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `USE OF FUNDS BY PRESIDENTIAL MERIT SCHOOLS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4710. A Presidential Merit School shall use its
 Presidential Merit School award for activities that further the educational

 or gifted and talented students; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) the purchase or lease of computers, telecommunications

 title to, and exercise administrative control of, all such equipment and
 materials; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) bonus payments for faculty and administrators;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) college scholarships for secondary school students;

 [Struck out->]   `(5) parental involvement activities; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(6) community outreach activities; and [<-Struck out]

 out]
 [Struck out->] `PROHIBITION ON STATE OR LOCAL REDUCTION OF OTHER ASSISTANCE
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4711. No Federal, State, or local agency may, in
 any year, take a Presidential Merit School award into account in determining
 whether to award any other assistance from Federal, State, or local resources,
 or in determining the amount of such assistance, to either the Presidential
 Merit School itself or the local educational agency, if any, that operates
 the school.'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] Part B--Magnet Schools of Excellence [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] MAGNET SCHOOLS OF EXCELLENCE [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   SEC. 111. Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education
 Act of 1965 is further amended by adding at the end thereof a new part H
 to read as follows: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `Part H--Magnet Schools of Excellence [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `SHORT TITLE [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4801. This part may be cited as the `Magnet Schools
 of Excellence Act of 1989'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `FINDINGS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4802. The Congress finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) no single method of education, or single way of
 organizing schools and school systems, is best for every community or every
 group of students; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) magnet schools have increased competition and choice
 and helped to improve the quality of schools and the education of children
 in the school districts in which they have been established; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) magnet schools that focus on mathematics and science
 train future leaders in disciplines that are of critical importance to the
 Nation's economic competitiveness; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) Federal funds should be made available for the
 design and implementation of magnet schools, not only to further school
 desegregation but also to expand educational choices for students and parents
 and the educational benefits of such special academic and vocational school
 programs. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `PURPOSE [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4803. (a) It is the purpose of this part to support the
 establishment, expansion, or enhancement of Magnet Schools of Excellence in
 order to promote open enrollment through parental choice and to strengthen
 the knowledge of elementary and secondary school students in academic and
 vocational subjects. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) As used in this part, the term `Magnet School
 of Excellence' means a public elementary or secondary school that--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) offers the highest quality instruction in an academic or
 vocational discipline or creates a unique and effective learning environment;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) is open to students from beyond the immediate school
 attendance area; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) is capable of attracting students from a variety of
 backgrounds. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4804. For the purpose of carrying out this part,
 there are authorized to be appropriated $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1990
 and each of the three succeeding fiscal years. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `GRANT APPLICATIONS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4805. (a)(1) Any local educational agency, intermediate
 educational agency, or consortia of such agencies desiring to receive a grant
 under this part shall submit an application at such time, in such manner,
 and containing such information, as the Secretary may require. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) An applicant may be, but is not required to be,
 adopting or implementing a desegregation plan. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) Each application shall contain-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) a description of-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) the objectives of the proposed project and how those
 objectives will achieve the purpose of this part, as set out in section 4803;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) how the funds made available to the applicant will
 be used to provide an educational program of the highest quality that will
 encourage greater parental decisionmaking and involvement; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) such assurances as the Secretary may reasonably
 require. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(c) The Secretary shall encourage applications for proposed
 projects that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) recognize the potential of children who are
 educationally disadvantaged or who come from low-income families; and
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) establish, expand, or enhance magnet schools that
 focus on a particular educational approach or on a particular subject area,
 such as mathematics and science. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(d) Each application submitted pursuant to this section
 shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that any proposed
 project assisted with funds under this part will not result in segregation
 based upon race, religion, color, national origin, sex, or handicap,
 or impede the progress of desegregation within the applicant's school
 system. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `SELECTION OF APPLICATIONS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4806. In awarding grants under this part, the Secretary
 shall consider the quality of the proposed project, the likelihood of the
 project's successful implementation, and the likelihood of its strengthening
 the educational program of the applicant. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `LIMITATIONS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4807. (a) No Magnet School of Excellence may be
 supported with funds under this part for more than two years. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) No applicant may receive a grant for more than one
 year under this part, unless it demonstrates to the Secretary that the
 Magnet School of Excellence for which assistance was provided in the first
 year is making satisfactory progress in meeting the objectives specified
 in its approved application. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(c) No Federal, State, or local agency may, in any year,
 take a Magnet School of Excellence award into account in determining whether
 to award an other assistance from Federal, State, or local resources, or
 in determining the amount of such assistance, to either a Magnet School
 of Excellence itself or to the local educational agency or intermediate
 educational agency that operates the school.'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] Part C--Alternative Certification for Teachers and Principals
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION FOR TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS PROGRAM
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   SEC. 121. Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education
 Act of 1965 is further amended by adding at the end thereof a new part I
 to read as follows: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `Part I--Alternative Certification for Teachers and Principals
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `SHORT TITLE [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4901. This part may be cited as the `Alternative
 Certification of Teachers and Principals Assistance Act of 1989'. [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->] `FINDINGS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4902. The Congress finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) effective elementary and secondary schools require
 competent teachers and strong leadership; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) school systems would benefit greatly by recruitment
 pools of well-qualified individuals, such as scientists and engineers,
 from which to select teachers and principals; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) talented professionals who have demonstrated a high
 level of subject area competence or management and leadership qualities
 outside the education profession wish to pursue second careers in education,
 but often do not meet traditional certification requirements; and [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) alternative certification requirements that do not
 exclude such individuals from teaching or school administration solely
 because they do not meet current certification requirements would allow
 school systems to take advantage of these professionals and improve the
 supply of well-qualified teachers and principals. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `PURPOSE [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4903. (a) It is the purpose of this part to improve
 the supply of well-qualified elementary and secondary school teachers and
 principals by encouraging and assisting States to develop and implement
 alternative teacher and principal certification requirements. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) As used in this part, the term-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) `alternative teacher and principal certification
 requirements' means State or local requirements that permit entry into
 elementary and secondary teacher and principal positions for individuals
 who have demonstrated a high level of appropriate subject area competence,
 or management or leadership qualities, in careers in or out of the education
 field, but who would not otherwise meet existing requirements for teaching
 or supervisory positions. Alternative teacher and principal certification
 requirements may recognize that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) for teachers, a high level of demonstrated competence
 in an appropriate subject area may be substituted for traditional teacher
 certification requirements (such as teacher training course work); and
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) for principals, a high level of demonstrated competence
 in administration and management may be substituted for traditional principal
 certification requirements (such as teaching experience or supervisory
 experience in the field of education); and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) `State' means any of the States of the Union, the
 District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4904. For the purpose of carrying out this part,
 there are authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal year
 1990. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `ALLOTMENTS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4905. (a)(1) From the amount appropriated to carry
 out this part, the Secretary shall allot to each State the lesser of either
 the amount the State applies for under section 4906 or an amount that is
 proportional to the State's share of the total population of children ages
 five through seventeen in all the States (based on the most recent data
 available that is satisfactory to the Secretary). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) If a State does not apply for its allotment,
 or the full amount of its allotment, under the preceding paragraph, the
 Secretary may reallocate the excess funds to one or more other States that
 demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, a current need for the
 funds. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) Notwithstanding section 412(b) of the General Education
 Provisions Act, funds awarded under this part shall remain available for
 obligation by a recipient for a period of two calendar years from the date
 of the grant. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `STATE APPLICATIONS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 4906. (a) Any State desiring to receive a
 grant under this part shall submit an application at such time, in such
 manner, and containing such information, as the Secretary may reasonably
 require. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) Each State application shall-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) describe the programs, projects, and activities to
 be undertaken; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) contain such assurances as the Secretary deems
 necessary, including assurances that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) funds awarded to the State will be used to supplement,
 and not to supplant, any State or local funds available for the development
 and implementation of alternative teacher and principal certification
 requirements; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) the State has, in developing its application, consulted
 with the State or local agency that certifies teachers and principals,
 as well as representatives of elementary and secondary school teachers and
 principals, local school systems, parents, and other interested organizations
 and individuals; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) the State will submit to the Secretary, at such time as
 the Secretary may specify, a final report describing the activities carried

Part C--Alternative Certification for Teachers and Principals
SEC. 121. ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION FOR TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS PROGRAM.
  Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is further
  amended by adding at the end thereof a new part I to read as follows:
`Part I--Alternative Certification for Teachers and Principals
`SEC. 4901. SHORT TITLE.
  `This part may be cited as the `Alternative Certification of Teachers and
  Principals Assistance Act of 1989'.
`SEC. 4902. FINDINGS.
  `The Congress finds that--
  `(1) effective elementary and secondary schools require competent teachers
  and strong leadership;
  `(2) school systems would benefit greatly by recruitment pools of

  area competence or management and leadership qualities outside the education
  profession wish to pursue second careers in education, but often do not
  meet traditional certification requirements; and
  `(4) alternative certification requirements that do not exclude such
  individuals from teaching or school administration solely because they do not
  meet current certification requirements would allow school systems to take
  advantage of these professionals and improve the supply of well-qualified
  teachers and principals.
`SEC. 4903. PURPOSE.
  `It is the purpose of this part to improve the supply of well-qualified
  elementary and secondary school teachers and principals by encouraging

  demonstrated a high level of appropriate subject area competence, or
  management or leadership qualities, in careers in or out of the education
  field, but who would not otherwise meet existing requirements for teaching
  or supervisory positions. Alternative teacher and principal certification
  requirements may recognize that--
  `(A) for teachers, a high level of demonstrated competence in an appropriate
  subject area may be substituted for traditional teacher certification
  requirements (such as teacher training course work); and
  `(B) for principals, a high level of demonstrated competence in
  administration and management may be substituted for traditional principal
  certification requirements.
  `(2) The term `State' means any of the States of the Union, the District
  of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
