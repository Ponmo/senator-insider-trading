              TITLE II--NONCANDIDATE CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES

               Subtitle A--Electioneering Communications

SEC. 201. DISCLOSURE OF ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS.

    Section 304 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 
434), as amended by section 103, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(f) Additional Statements on Electioneering Communications.--
            ``(1) Statement required.--Every person who makes a 
        disbursement for electioneering communications in an aggregate 
        amount in excess of $10,000 during any calendar year shall, 
        within 24 hours of each disclosure date, file with the 
        Commission a statement containing the information described in 
        paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Contents of statement.--Each statement required to be 
        filed under this subsection shall be made under penalty of 
        perjury and shall contain the following information:
                    ``(A) The identification of the person making the 
                disbursement, of any entity sharing or exercising 
                direction or control over the activities of such 
                person, and of the custodian of the books and accounts 
                of the person making the disbursement.
                    ``(B) The principal place of business of the person 
                making the disbursement, if not an individual.
                    ``(C) The amount of each disbursement of more than 
                $200 during the period covered by the statement and the 
                identification of the person to whom the disbursement 
                was made.
                    ``(D) The elections to which the electioneering 
                communications pertain and the names (if known) of the 
                candidates identified or to be identified.
                    ``(E) If the disbursements were paid out of a 
                segregated bank account which consists of funds 
                contributed solely by individuals directly to this 
                account for electioneering communications, the names 
                and addresses of all contributors who contributed an 
                aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to that account 
                during the period beginning on the first day of the 
                preceding calendar year and ending on the disclosure 
                date. Nothing in this subparagraph is to be construed 
                as a prohibition on the use of funds in such a 
                segregated account for a purpose other than 
                electioneering communications.
                    ``(F) If the disbursements were paid out of funds 
                not described in subparagraph (E), the names and

                aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the organization

                preceding calendar year and ending on the disclosure 
                date.

                decision to support the regulation provided herein, 
                then the term `electioneering communication' means any

                attacks or opposes a candidate for that office 
                (regardless of whether the communication expressly 
                advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which 
                also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than 
                an exhortation to vote for or against a specific 
                candidate. Nothing in this subsection shall be 
                construed to affect the interpretation or application 
                of section 100.22(b) of title 11, Code of Federal 
                Regulations.
