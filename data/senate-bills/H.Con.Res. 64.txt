      REDUCTION.
    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that any legislation

shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating the amount of any 
deficit increase called for in section 252(b) of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended by the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1990.

SEC. 12. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.

    (a) Purpose.--The Senate declares that it is essential to--
        (1) ensure compliance with the deficit reduction goals embodied 
    in this resolution;
        (2) extend the system of discretionary spending limits set forth 
    in section 601 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974;
        (3) extend the pay-as-you-go enforcement system;
        (4) prohibit the consideration of direct spending or receipts 
    legislation that would decrease the pay-as-you-go surplus that the 
    reconciliation bill pursuant to section 7 of this resolution will 
    create under section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
    Deficit Control Act of 1985;
        (5) adopt as part of this concurrent resolution such of the 
    enforcement procedures set forth in this subsection as this 
    concurrent resolution may constitutionally include; and
        (6) enact, during this session of Congress, such of the 
    enforcement procedures set forth in this subsection as only statute 
    may constitutionally include.
    (b) Discretionary Spending Limits.--
        (1) Definition.--As used in this section, for the discretionary 
    category, the term ``discretionary spending limit'' means--
            (A) with respect to fiscal year 1996:
                $519,142,000,000 in new budget authority and

            $547,870,000,000 in outlays;
    as adjusted for changes in concepts and definitions, changes in 
    inflation, and emergency appropriations.
        (2) Point of order in the senate.--
            (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), it shall not be 
        in order in the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution on 
        the budget for fiscal year 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 (or 
        amendment, motion, or conference report on such a resolution) 
        that would exceed any of the discretionary spending limits in 
        this section.
            (B) This subsection shall not apply if a declaration of war 
        by the Congress is in effect or if a joint resolution pursuant 
        to section 258 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985 has been enacted.
    (c) Enforcing Pay-As-You-Go.--At any time after the enactment of the 
reconciliation bill pursuant to section 7 of this resolution, it shall 
not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, 
amendment, motion, or conference report, that would increase the deficit 
in this resolution for any fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 or would 
increase the deficit for any other fiscal year through fiscal year 2003, 
as measured by the sum of--
        (1) all applicable estimates of direct spending and receipts 
    legislation applicable to that fiscal year, other than any amounts 
    resulting from--
            (A) full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit 
        insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of 
        enactment of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990; and
            (B) emergency provisions as designated under section 252(e) 
        of that Act; and
        (2) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs 
    applicable to that fiscal year resulting from the prior year's 
    sequestration under that Act, if any (except for any amounts 
    sequestered as a result of a net deficit increase in the fiscal year 
    immediately preceding the prior fiscal year).

only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen 
and sworn.
    (e) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of the Chair 
relating to any provision of this section shall be limited to 1 hour, to

case may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the 
Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to 
sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised 
under this section.

    (g) Exercise of Rulemaking Powers.--The Senate adopts the provisions 
of this section--
        (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, and as 
    such they shall be considered as part of the rules of the Senate, 
    and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that 
    they are inconsistent therewith; and
        (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the 
    Senate to change those rules (so far as they relate to the Senate) 
    at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the 
    case of any other rule of the Senate.

SEC. 13. SENSE OF THE SENATE PROVISIONS.

    The following subsections are set forth as the sense of the Senate:
        (a) Assumptions.--The levels and amounts set forth in this 
    resolution are based on the following assumptions:
            (1) Revenues.--(A) There shall not be an increase in inland 
        barge fuel taxes beyond those increases already scheduled in 
        current law.
            (B) The Finance Committee will make every effort to find 
        alternative sources of revenues before imposing new taxes on the 
        benefits of Social Security beneficiaries with threshold incomes 
        (for purposes of the taxation of Social Security benefits) of 
        less than $32,000 for individuals and $40,000 for married 
        couples filing joint returns.
            (C) Consistent with the position of the Administration, the 
        BTU tax will be imposed at the same rate on all fuels purchased 
        by households for home heating purposes, and therefore the 
        supplemental tax on oil will not be imposed on such fuels.
            (D) Any energy tax enacted during the One Hundred Third 
        Congress should provide such relief to the agriculture industry 
        as is necessary to ensure that the industry does not absorb a 
        disproportionate impact of that tax.
            (2) National defense (function 050).--(A) If the estimates 
        for inflation for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 used in the 
        President's fiscal year 1994 budget request and this concurrent 
        resolution are too low, the amounts for budget authority and 
        outlays for the National Defense (050) and other budget 
        functions should be increased to offset the adverse effects of 
        the higher inflation.
            (B) If Congress does not enact legislation freezing Federal 
        pay levels for fiscal year 1994 and reducing the rates of 
        increase in Federal pay levels for fiscal years 1995 through 
        1997, as assumed for the President's fiscal year 1994 budget 
        request and this concurrent resolution, there should be 
        appropriate increases in the amounts of budget authority and 
        outlays for the National Defense (050) and other budget 
        functions in this concurrent resolution to allow the departments 
        and agencies of the Federal Government to meet the resulting 
        increases in costs for pay.
            (C) Appropriations for fiscal year 1994 for the programs, 
        projects, activities, and authorities under budget functional 
        category 050 (National Defense) should be made at the levels of 
        budget authority and outlays that are provided for in this 
        concurrent resolution for such functional category for such 
        fiscal year.
            (D) If the appropriations for fiscal year 1994 for such 
        programs, projects, activities, and authorities are less than 
        the levels of budget authority and outlays that are provided for 
        in this concurrent resolution for such functional category for 
        such fiscal year, the savings resulting from the lesser levels 
        of appropriations should be used only for reducing the deficit 
        in the budget of the United States.
            (E) The Congress should promptly reconsider the amounts 
        determined and declared by the Congress in this resolution to be 
        the appropriate levels of new budget authority, outlays, new 
        direct loan obligations, and new primary loan guarantee 
        commitments for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 for the National 
        Defense (050) functional category, in the event of material 
        change in situations affecting the security interests of the 
        United States.
            (3) General science, space, and technology (function 250).--
        The budget authority and outlay figures for function 250 in this 
        resolution do not assume any amounts for the National 
        Aeronautics and Space Administration for any fiscal year from 
        1994 through 1998 in excess of the amounts proposed by the 
        President for such fiscal year.
            (4) Natural resources and environment (function 300).--(A) 
        Fees charged for domestic livestock grazing on lands under the 
        jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary 
        of the Interior in western States should be set at an amount 
        that permits the ranching industry to remain viable and reflects 
        the economic realities of the industry, rather than at an amount 
        that meets arbitrary revenue targets.
            (B) Royalty fees charged for hardrock mining should be set 
        at an amount that permits the mining industry to remain viable 
        in the United States and reflects the economic realities of the 
        industry, rather than at an amount that meets arbitrary revenue 
        targets.
            (5) Education, training, employment, and social services 
        (function 500).--(A) The Head Start program will be funded at 
        the level requested by the President for fiscal year 1998.
            (B) The education reform and initiatives will be funded at 
        the level requested by the President for fiscal year 1998.
            (C) The defense conversion programs will be funded at the 
        level requested by the President for fiscal year 1998.
            (6) Health (function 550).--(A) The Committee on Labor and 
        Human Resources will make every effort to embark upon a 
        sustained investment strategy in health research and development 
        over the next 5 years and support for the continuum of medical 
        research should be a central feature in any plan to reform the 
        United States health care system.
            (B) The vast majority of rising mandatory program costs is 
        due to increasing Federal health care costs, and these costs are 
        assumed in the levels set forth in this resolution.
            (C) Health care reform is essential to curb the escalating 
        costs of health entitlement programs to reduce the deficit.
            (D) The reduction in health costs in this budget resolution 
        should be augmented by further savings in Federal health outlays 
        as a part of comprehensive health care reform which will be 
        reflected in future budget resolutions.
            (E) Comprehensive health reform will result in long term 
        savings both for the public and private sectors of the American 
        economy, and reduce the deficit levels set forth in this 
        resolution at an ever increasing pace.
            (F) Health care reform legislation should receive priority 
        attention by the United States Congress with a target date of 
        enactment of such legislation being no later then September 30, 
        1993.
            (7) Income security (function 600).--The Women, Infants, and 
        Children (WIC) program will be funded at the level requested by 
        the President for fiscal year 1998.
            (8) Administration of justice (function 750).--(A) The 
        Community Policing (``Cops on the Beat'') program will be funded 
        at the level requested by the President for fiscal year 1998.
            (B) Funds to reduce the availability and use of illegal 
        drugs will be shifted over the next 5 years so that the 
        allocation shall be equally distributed between the so-called 
        ``supply side'' (interdiction, law enforcement, and 
        international supply reduction efforts) and the so-called 
        ``demand side'' (education, rehabilitation, treatment, and 
        research programs).
        (b) Debt Limit in Reconciliation.--(1) Any concurrent resolution 
    on the budget that contains reconciliation directives shall include 
    a directive with respect to the statutory limit on the public debt.
        (2) Any change in the statutory limit on the public debt that is 
    recommended pursuant to a reconciliation directive shall be included 
    in the reconciliation legislation reported pursuant to section 310 
    of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for that fiscal year.
        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (4), the Senate shall not 
    consider any bill or joint resolution (or any amendment thereto or 
    conference report thereon) that increases the statutory limit on the 
    public debt during a fiscal year above the level set forth as 
    appropriate for that fiscal year in the concurrent resolution on the 
    budget for that fiscal year agreed to under section 301 of the 
    Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
        (4) The prohibition of paragraph (3) shall not apply to a 
    reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported pursuant 
    to section 310(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 during any 
    fiscal year (or any conference report thereon) that contains a 
    provision that--
            (A) increases the statutory limit on the public debt 
        pursuant to a directive of the type described in section 
        310(a)(3) of that Act; and
            (B) becomes effective on or after the first day of the 
        following fiscal year.
        (c) Deficit Reduction Account.--It is assumed that the Committee 
    on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the 
    House of Representatives should report legislation to--
            (1) establish a separate account in the Treasury into which 
        all of the amounts by which the aggregate levels of Federal 
        revenue should be increased would be deposited;
            (2) ensure that any revenues deposited in such account would 
        not be available for appropriation; and
            (3) provide that any such revenues deposited in such account
