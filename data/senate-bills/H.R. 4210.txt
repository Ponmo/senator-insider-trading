 determined under this subsection, include in gross income for the taxable

 [Struck out->]   `(a) ADJUSTMENTS FLOW THROUGH TO PARTNERS FOR YEAR IN
 WHICH ADJUSTMENT TAKES EFFECT-  [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) IN GENERAL- If any partnership adjustment with respect
 to any partnership item takes effect (within the meaning of subsection
 (d)(2)) during any partnership taxable year and if an election under paragraph
 (2) does not apply to such adjustment, such adjustment shall be taken into
 account in determining the amount of such item for the partnership taxable
 year in which such adjustment takes effect. In applying this title to any
 person who is (directly or indirectly) a partner in such partnership during
 such partnership taxable year, such adjustment shall be treated as an item
 actually arising during such taxable year. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) PARTNERSHIP LIABLE IN CERTAIN CASES- If-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) a partnership elects under this paragraph to not take
 an adjustment into account under paragraph (1), [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) a partnership does not make such an election but
 in filing its return for any partnership taxable year fails to take fully
 into account any partnership adjustment as required under paragraph (1),
 or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) any partnership adjustment involves a reduction in a
 credit which exceeds the amount of such credit determined for the partnership
 taxable year in which the adjustment takes effect, [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] the partnership shall pay to the Secretary an amount determined
 by applying the rules of subsection (b)(4) to the adjustments not so taken
 into account and any excess referred to in subparagraph (C). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) OFFSETTING ADJUSTMENTS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- If a
 partnership adjustment requires another adjustment in a taxable year after
 the adjusted year and before the partnership taxable year in which such
 partnership adjustment takes effect, such other adjustment shall be taken
 into account under this subsection for the partnership taxable year in
 which such partnership adjustment takes effect. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) COORDINATION WITH PART II- Amounts taken into account
 under this subsection for any partnership taxable year shall continue to
 be treated as adjustments for the adjusted year for purposes of determining
 whether such amounts may be readjusted under part II. [<-Struck out]

 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) IN GENERAL- If a partnership adjustment takes effect

 [Struck out->]   `(A) shall pay to the Secretary interest computed under
 paragraph (2), and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) shall be liable for any penalty, addition to tax,
 or additional amount as provided in paragraph (3). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF INTEREST- The interest
 computed under this paragraph with respect to any partnership adjustment
 is the interest which would be determined under chapter 67-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) on the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph
 (4) with respect to such adjustment, [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) for the period beginning on the day after the return
 due date for the adjusted year and ending on the return due date for the
 partnership taxable year in which such adjustment takes effect (or, if
 earlier, in the case of any adjustment to which subsection (a)(2) applies,
 the date on which the payment under subsection (a)(2) is made). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] Proper adjustments in the amount determined under the preceding
 sentence shall be made for adjustments required for partnership taxable
 years after the adjusted year and before the year in which the partnership
 adjustment takes effect by reason of such partnership adjustment. [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) PENALTIES- A partnership shall be liable for any
 penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which it would have been
 liable if such partnership had been an individual subject to tax under
 chapter 1 for the adjusted year and the imputed underpayment determined
 under paragraph (4) were an actual underpayment (or understatement) for
 such year. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) IMPUTED UNDERPAYMENT- For purposes of this subsection,
 the imputed underpayment determined under this paragraph with respect to
 any partnership adjustment is the underpayment (if any) which would result--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) by netting all adjustments to items of income, gain,
 loss, or deduction and-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) if such netting results in a net increase in income,
 by treating such net increase as an underpayment equal to the amount of
 such net increase multiplied by the highest rate of tax in effect under
 section 1 or 11 for the adjusted year, or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) if such netting results in a net decrease in income,
 by treating such net decrease as an overpayment equal to such net decrease
 multiplied by such highest rate, and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) by taking adjustments to credits into account
 as increases or decreases (whichever is appropriate) in the amount of
 tax. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] For purposes of the preceding sentence, any net decrease in
 a loss shall be treated as an increase in income and a similar rule shall
 apply to a net increase in a loss. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(c) ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS-  [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) IN GENERAL- Any payment required by subsection (a)(2)
 or (b)(1)(A)-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) shall be assessed and collected in the same manner
 as if it were a tax imposed by subtitle C, and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) shall be paid on or before the return due date for
 the partnership taxable year in which the partnership adjustment takes
 effect. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) INTEREST- For purposes of determining interest, any
 payment required by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A) shall be treated as an

 [Struck out->]   `(A) IN GENERAL- In the case of any failure by any
 partnership to pay on the date prescribed therefor any amount required by

 a penalty of 10 percent of the underpayment. For purposes of the preceding
 sentence, the term `underpayment' means the excess of any payment required
 under this section over the amount (if any) paid on or before the date
 prescribed therefor. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) ACCURACY-RELATED AND FRAUD PENALTIES MADE APPLICABLE-

 made. [<-Struck out]

 [Struck out->]   `(2) FURTHER NOTICES RESTRICTED- If the Secretary mails a
 notice of a partnership adjustment to any partnership for any partnership

 another such notice to such partnership with respect to such taxable
 year. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) AUTHORITY TO RESCIND NOTICE WITH PARTNERSHIP CONSENT-
 The Secretary may, with the consent of the partnership, rescind any notice
 of a partnership adjustment mailed to such partnership. Any notice so

 [Struck out->]   `(2) PARTNERSHIP MAY WAIVE RESTRICTIONS- The partnership

 partnership would be liable under section 6242(b) (as of the date of the
 filing of the petition) if the partnership items were adjusted as provided

 of any such determination shall be treated as being the date of the court's
 order entering the decision. [<-Struck out]

 brought under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission

 time. [<-Struck out]

 [Struck out->]   `(a) GENERAL RULE- If-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) a taxpayer files an oversheltered return for a taxable
 year, [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) the Secretary makes a determination with respect to

 [Struck out->]   `(3) the adjustments resulting from such determination do

 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] the Secretary is authorized to send a notice of adjustment
 reflecting such determination to the taxpayer by certified or registered
 mail. [<-Struck out]

 the taxable year to which the notice of adjustment relates, in accordance

 such. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(d) FAILURE TO FILE PETITION-  [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in paragraph (2), if

 adjustment is placed on the docket of the Tax Court, until the decision of
 the Tax Court becomes final), and for 60 days thereafter. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) RESTRICTIONS ON ASSESSMENT- Except as otherwise

 shall be made-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) until the expiration of the applicable 90-day or
 150-day period set forth in subsection (c) for filing a petition with the
 Tax Court, or [<-Struck out]

 Secretary mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer for a taxable year and
 the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed
 in subsection (c), the Secretary may not mail another such notice to the

 SUBCHAPTER-  [<-Struck out]

 affected items in a proceeding under section 6230(a)(2), for the taxable
 year involved. Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law pertaining to
 the period of limitations on the making of assessments, for purposes of
 the preceding sentence, any adjustment made in accordance with this section
 shall be taken into account regardless of whether any assessment has been
 made with respect to such adjustment. [<-Struck out]

 adjustment is made within the period prescribed by section 6229 for assessing
 any tax under subtitle A which is attributable to any partnership item or
 affected item for the taxable year involved. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) CONVERSION TO DEFICIENCY PROCEEDING- If-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) after the notice referred to in subsection (a)
 is mailed to a taxpayer for a taxable year but before the expiration of
 the period for filing a petition with the Tax Court under subsection (c)
 (or, if a petition is filed with the Tax Court, before the Tax Court makes

 for the taxable year is finally determined, or any such item ceases to be
 a partnership item pursuant to section 6231(b), and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) as a result of that final determination or cessation,
 a deficiency can be determined with respect to the items that are the
 subject of the notice of adjustment, [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] the notice of adjustment shall be treated as a notice of
 deficiency under section 6212 and any petition filed in respect of the notice

 [Struck out->]   `(A) the Secretary enters into a settlement agreement
 (within the meaning of section 6224) with the taxpayer regarding such items,
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment
 has been issued and-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) no petition has been filed under section 6226 and
 the time for doing so has expired, or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) a petition has been filed under section 6226 and

 APPLICABLE PROCEDURE-  [<-Struck out]

 OF ADJUSTMENT- If the Secretary erroneously determines that subchapter B
 does not apply to a taxable year of a taxpayer and consistent with that
 determination timely mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer pursuant
 to subsection (a) of this section, the notice of adjustment shall be treated
 as a notice of deficiency under section 6212 and any petition that is filed
 in respect of the notice shall be treated as an action brought under section
 6213. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) SPECIAL RULE IF SECRETARY ERRONEOUSLY MAILS NOTICE OF
