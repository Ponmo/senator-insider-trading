                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
     To acknowledge the Historic Northern Ireland Peace Agreement.

Whereas the people of Ireland have experienced civil conflict throughout their 
        history with the latest phase, known as The Troubles, ongoing for the 
        last thirty years;
Whereas this tragic history has cost the lives of thousands of men, women, and 
        children, and has left a deep and profound legacy of suffering;
Whereas the governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom have 
        endeavored for many years to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the 
        conflict in Northern Ireland; and such efforts, including the 1985 
        Anglo-Irish Agreement, the 1993 Joint Declaration, and the 1995 New 
        Framework for Agreement, were important milestones in guiding the 
        parties toward a political agreement;
Whereas the announced cessation of armed hostilities in 1994 by the Irish 
        Republican Army and the Combined Loyalist Military Command created the 
        opportunity for all-inclusive political discussions to occur;
Whereas representatives from Northern Ireland's political parties, pledging to 
        adhere to the principles of non-violence, commenced all-party talks in 
        June 1996, and those talks greatly intensified in the Spring of 1998 
        under the chairmanship of former United States Senator George Mitchell;
Whereas the active participation of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish 
        Taoiseach Bertie Ahern was indispensable to the success of negotiations;
Whereas the support and encouragement for the Northern Ireland peace process by 
        President Clinton, on behalf of the United States, was also an important 
        factor in the success of the negotiations;
Whereas on April 10, 1998, the political parties, together with the British and 
        Irish Governments successfully concluded the Northern Ireland Peace 
        Agreement;
Whereas people throughout the island will have an opportunity to approve or 
        reject the final agreement during the May 22 referendums; and
Whereas the British and Irish Governments have committed to making the necessary 
        constitutional and other legal changes necessary to bring the agreement 
        into effect after the referendum approval processes have been concluded: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) all of the participants in the negotiations deserve 
        congratulations for their willingness to make honorable 
        compromises in order to reach an agreement that promises to end 
        the tragic cycle of violence that has dominated Northern 
        Ireland for decades;
            (2) Prime Minister Tony Blair and Taoiseach Bertie Ahern 
        deserve particular credit for their leadership and constant 
        encouragement in support of the peace process;
            (3) the American people can be especially proud of the 
        contributions made by the United States in the quest for peace, 
        including President Clinton's vision and determination to 
        achieve peace in Northern Ireland and his personal commitment 
        to remain an active supporter throughout the process; and
            (4) all friends of Ireland owe a lasting debt of gratitude 
        to Senator George Mitchell for his dedication, courage, 
        leadership, and wisdom in guiding the peace talks to a 
        successful conclusion.

            Passed the Senate April 23, 1998.

            Attest:

                                                    GARY SISCO,

                                                             Secretary.
