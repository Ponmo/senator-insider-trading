SEC. 130. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MARINE CORPS AMPHIBIOUS LIFT AND 
              PRESENCE REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States Marine Corps is a combat force which 
        leverages maneuver from the sea as a force multiplier allowing 
        for a variety of operational tasks ranging from major combat 
        operations to humanitarian assistance.
            (2) The United States Marine Corps is unique in that, while 
        embarked upon Naval vessels, they bring all the logistic 
        support necessary for the full range of military operations, 
        operating ``from the sea'' they require no third party host 
        nation permission to conduct military operations.
            (3) The Department of the Navy has a requirement for 38 
        amphibious assault ships to meet this full range of military 
        operations.
            (4) Due to fiscal constraints only, that requirement of 38 
        vessels was reduced to 33 vessels, which adds military risk to 
        future operations.
            (5) The Department of the Navy has been unable to meet even 
        the minimal requirement of 30 operationally available vessels 
        and has submitted a shipbuilding and ship retirement plan to 
        Congress which will reduce the force to 28 vessels.
            (6) Experience has shown that early engineering and design 
        of naval vessels has significantly reduced the acquisition 
        costs and life-cycle costs of those vessels.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense should carefully evaluate the 
        maritime force structure necessary to execute demand for forces 
        by the commanders of the combatant commands;
            (2) the Department of the Navy carefully evaluate 
        amphibious lift capabilities to meet current and projected 
        requirements;
            (3) the Department of the Navy should consider 
        prioritization of investment in and procurement of the next 
        generation of amphibious assault ships, as a component of the 
        balanced battle force;
            (4) the next generation amphibious assault ships should 
        maintain survivability protection;
            (5) operation and maintenance requirements analysis, as 
        well as the potential to leverage a common hull form design, 
        should be considered to reduce total ownership cost and 
        acquisition cost; and
            (6) maintaining a robust amphibious ship building 
        industrial base is vital for the future of the national 
        security of the United States.

Department of the Navy for fiscal year 2014 for F-18 aircraft includes 
a request for funds for more than 13 new F-18 aircraft, the budget 
request of the Department of the Navy for fiscal year 2014 for F-35 
aircraft should include a request for funds for not fewer than 6 F-35B 
aircraft and 4 F-35C aircraft, presuming that development, testing, and 
production of the F-35 aircraft are proceeding according to current

                  Subtitle C--Missile Defense Matters

SEC. 231. HOMELAND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Ballistic Missile Defense Review of February 2010 
        stated as its first policy priority that ``the United States 
        will continue to defend the homeland against the threat of 
        limited ballistic missile attack'' and that ``an essential 
        element of the United States' homeland ballistic missile 
        defense strategy is to hedge against future uncertainties, 
        including both the uncertainty of future threat capabilities 
        and the technical risks inherent to our own development 
        plans''.
            (2) The United States currently has an operational Ground-
        based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system with 30 Ground-Based 
        Interceptors (GBIs) deployed in Alaska and California, 
        protecting the United States against the potential future 
        threat of limited ballistic missile attack from countries such 
        as North Korea and Iran.
            (3) As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear 
        and Missile Defense Policy Bradley Roberts testified before the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April 25, 2012, 
        ``[w]ith 30 GBIs in place, the United States is in an 
        advantageous position vis-a-vis the threats from North Korea 
        and Iran,'' and ``neither has successfully tested an ICBM or 
        demonstrated an ICBM-class warhead''.
            (4) Deputy Assistant Secretary Roberts testified that 
        maintaining this advantageous position ``requires continued 
        improvement to the GMD system, including enhanced performance 
        by the GBIs and the deployment of new sensors. It also requires 
        the development of the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) 
        to handle larger raid sizes and the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) 
        Block IIB as the ICBM threat from states like Iran and North 
        Korea matures. These efforts will help to ensure that the 
        United States possesses the capability to counter the projected 
        threat for the foreseeable future''.
            (5) As its highest priority, the Missile Defense Agency is 
        designing a correction to the problem that caused a December 
        2010 flight test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system using the Capability Enhancement II (CE-II) model of 
        exo-atmospheric kill vehicle, and plans to demonstrate the 
        correction in two flight tests before resuming production or 
        assembly of additional Capability Enhancement II kill vehicles.
            (6) The Department of Defense has a program to improve the 
        performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system, including a plan to test every component of the 
        Ground-Based Interceptors for reliability. According to 
        Department of Defense officials, the goal of the Ground-Based 
        Interceptor reliability program is to double the number of 
        threat Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) that our 
        current inventory of Ground-Based Interceptors could defeat, 
        thereby effectively doubling the capability of our current 
        Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.
            (7) The Missile Defense Agency, working with the Director 
        of Operational Test and Evaluation and with United States 
        Strategic Command, has developed a comprehensive Integrated 
        Master Test Plan (IMTP) for missile defense, with flight tests 
        for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system planned through 
        fiscal year 2022, including salvo testing, multiple 
        simultaneous engagement testing, and operational testing.
            (8) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, who 
        must review, approve, and sign each semi-annual version of the 
        Integrated Master Test Plan, testified that the Test Plan is 
        ``a robust and rigorous test plan''. He also testified that the 
        current pace of Ground-based Midcourse Defense system testing 
        of one flight test per year is the ``best that we've been able 
        to achieve over a decade''.
            (9) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency testified 
        before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April 
        25, 2012, that flight testing the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system more often than once per year could cause 
        ``greater risk of further failure and setbacks to developing 
        our homeland defense capability as rapidly as possible''.
            (10) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy, the 
        Department of Defense has already decided upon or implemented a 
        number of actions to improve the missile defense posture of the 
        United States in case the threat of Intercontinental Ballistic 
        Missiles from North Korea or Iran emerges sooner or in greater 
        numbers than anticipated. These include the following actions:
                    (A) The Missile Defense Agency has completed 
                construction of Missile Field-2 at Fort Greely, Alaska, 
                with eight extra silos available to deploy additional 
                operational Ground-Based Interceptors, if needed.
                    (B) With its request for 5 additional Ground-Based 
                Interceptors in the budget of the President for fiscal 
                year 2013, the Missile Defense Agency plans to have 
                enough test and spare Ground-Based Interceptors to 
                emplace in the 8 extra silos from 2014 through 2025, 
                and will keep the Ground-Based Interceptor production 
                line active for 5 additional years, thus allowing 
                additional Ground-Based Interceptor purchases in the 
                future, if needed.
                    (C) The Department has decided not to decommission 
                prototype Missile Field-1 at Fort Greely but, instead, 
                to keep it in a storage status that would permit it to 
                be refurbished and reactivated within a few years if 
                future threat developments make that necessary.
                    (D) The Missile Defense Agency plans to build an 
                in-flight interceptor communications terminal at Fort 
                Drum, New York, to enhance the performance of Ground-
                Based Interceptors defending the eastern United States 
                against possible future missile threats from Iran.
                    (E) The Missile Defense Agency is continuing the 
                development and testing of the two-stage Ground-Based 
                Interceptor for possible deployment in the future, if 
                needed.
                    (F) The Missile Defense Agency is upgrading early 
                warning radars in Clear, Alaska, and Cape Cod, 
                Massachusetts, to enhance the ability to defend against 
                potential multiple future Intercontinental Ballistic 
                Missile threats from North Korea and Iran.
                    (G) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing 
                development of the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB 
                interceptor for Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive 
                Approach. It is intended to augment the Ground-based 
                Midcourse Defense system as a cost-effective first 
                layer of defense of the homeland against a possible 
                future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threat from 
                Iran.
                    (H) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing 
                development of the Precision Tracking Space System, a 
                satellite sensor system to provide persistent tracking 
                of large numbers of missiles in flight, and fire-
                control quality targeting data to various missile 
                defense interceptor systems. According to the Director 
                of the Missile Defense Agency, ``the greatest future 
                enhancement for both homeland and regional defense in 
                the next ten years is the development of the Precision 
                Tracking Space System satellites''.
            (11) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy 
        review, the Department of Defense is considering other options 
        to enhance the future United States posture to defend the 
        homeland, including the feasibility, advisability and 
        affordability of deploying additional Ground-Based 
        Interceptors, either in Alaska or at a missile defense site on 
        the East Coast of the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is a national priority to defend the homeland 
        against the potential future threat of limited ballistic 
        missile attack from countries such as North Korea and Iran;
            (2) the currently deployed Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system, with 30 Ground-Based Interceptors deployed in Alaska 
        and California, provides protection of the United States 
        homeland against the potential future threat of limited 
        ballistic missile attack from North Korea and Iran;
            (3) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system to achieve the levels of reliability, availability, 
        sustainability, and operational performance that will allow it 
        to continue providing protection of the United States homeland 
        against limited ballistic missile attack;
            (4) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest 
        priority, correct the problem that caused the December 2010 
        Ground-based Midcourse Defense system flight test failure and 
        demonstrate the correction in flight tests before resuming 
        production of the Capability Enhancement-II kill vehicle, in 
        order to provide confidence that the system will work as 
        intended;
            (5) the Department of Defense should continue to enhance 
        the performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system, and enhance the capability of the Ballistic 
        Missile Defense System, to provide improved capability to 
        defend the homeland against possible increased future missile 
        threats from North Korea and Iran;
            (6) the Missile Defense Agency should continue its robust, 
        rigorous, and realistic testing of the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system at a pace of one flight test per year, as 
        described in the Integrated Master Test Plan, including salvo 
        testing, multiple simultaneous engagement testing, and 
        operational testing;
            (7) if successfully developed, the Standard Missile-3 Block 
        IIB interceptor would provide an essential first layer of 
        defense of the homeland against an emerging Intercontinental 
        Ballistic Missile threat from Iran, using a cost-effective 
        forward-based early intercept system that could permit holding 
        Ground-Based Interceptors in reserve, and if such interceptor 
        could be deployed on ships, it would also provide a significant 
        enhancement to defense against possible future threats from 
        North Korea;
            (8) the Precision Tracking Space System has the potential 
        to improve dramatically the capability of homeland and regional 
        missile defense systems against large numbers of missiles 
        launched simultaneously, and should remain a high priority for 
        development;
            (9) the Department of Defense has taken a number of 
        prudent, affordable, cost-effective, and operationally 
        significant steps to hedge against the possibility of future 
        growth in the missile threat to the homeland from North Korea 
        and Iran; and
            (10) the Department of Defense should continue to evaluate 
        the evolution of the long-range missile threat from North Korea 
        and Iran and consider other possibilities for prudent, 
        affordable, cost-effective, and operationally significant steps 
        to improve the posture of the United States to defend the 
        homeland against possible future growth in the threat.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
        shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report

SEC. 232. REGIONAL BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the introduction to the Ballistic Missile Defense 
        Review of February 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
        states that ``I have made defending against near-term regional 
        threats a top priority of our missile defense plans, programs 
        and capabilities''.
            (2) In describing the threat of regional ballistic 
        missiles, the report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Review 
        states that ``there is no uncertainty about the existence of 
        regional threats. They are clear and present. The threat from 
        short-range, medium-range, and intermediate-range ballistic 
        missiles (SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs) in regions where the United 
        States deploys forces and maintains security relationships is 
        growing at a particularly rapid pace''.
            (3) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of 
        the Senate on April 25, 2012, Dr. Bradley Roberts, Deputy 
        Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense 
        Policy stated, with respect to regional missile defense, that 
        ``the need arises from the rapidly emerging threats to our 
        armed forces in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia from 
        regional missile proliferators and the basic challenge such 
        proliferation poses to the safety and security of our forces 
        and allies and to our power projection strategy''.
            (4) Iran has the largest inventory of regional ballistic 
        missiles in the Middle East, with hundreds of missiles that can 
        reach southeastern Europe and all of the Middle East, including 
        Israel. Iran is improving its existing missiles and developing 
        new and longer-range missiles.
            (5) North Korea has a large and growing inventory of short-
        range and medium-range ballistic missiles that can reach United 
        States forces and allies in South Korea and Japan. North Korea 
        is improving its existing missiles and developing new and 
        longer-range missiles.
            (6) In September 2009, President Barack Obama announced 
        that he had accepted the unanimous recommendation of the 
        Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to establish 
        a European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense, 
        designed to protect deployed United States forces and allies 
        and partners in Europe against the large and growing threat of 
        ballistic missiles from Iran.
            (7) In November 2010, at the Lisbon Summit, the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to adopt the core 
        mission of missile defense of its population, territory and 
        forces. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to 
        enhance its missile defense command and control system, the 
        Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense, to provide a 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization command and control 
        capability. This is in addition to contributions of missile 
        defense capability from individual nations.
            (8) During 2011, the United States successfully implemented 
        Phase 1 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, including 
        deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey, deployment of an 
        Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ship in the eastern 
        Mediterranean Sea with Standard Missile-3 Block IA 
        interceptors, and establishment of a missile defense command 
        and control system in Germany.
            (9) During 2011, the United States successfully negotiated 
        all the international agreements with North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization allies needed to permit future phases of the 
        European Phased Adaptive Approach, including agreements with 
        Romania and Poland to permit the deployment of Aegis Ashore 
        missile defense systems on their territory, an agreement with 
        Turkey to permit deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar on its 
        territory, and an agreement with Spain to permit the forward 
        stationing of four Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships at 
        Rota.
            (10) Phase 2 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is 
        planned for deployment in 2015, and is planned to include the 
        deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptors on Aegis 
        Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore site in 
        Romania.
            (11) Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is 
        planned for deployment in 2018, and is planned to include the 
        deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptors on 
        Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore 
        site in Poland.
            (12) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is 
        planned for deployment in 2020, and is planned to include the 
        deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptors at 
        Aegis Ashore sites. This interceptor is intended to protect 
        both Europe and the United States against potential future 
        long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.
            (13) At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in 
        Chicago in 2012, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans 
        to announce it has achieved an ``interim capability'' for the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense system, 
        including initial capability of its Active Layered Theater 
        Ballistic Missile Defense system at a command and control 
        facility in Germany.
            (14) The United States has a robust program of missile 
        defense cooperation with Israel, including joint development of 
        the Arrow Weapon System and the new Arrow-3 upper tier 
        interceptor, designed to defend Israel against ballistic 
        missiles from Iran. These jointly developed missile defense 
        systems are designed to be interoperable with United States 
        ballistic missile defenses, and these interoperable systems are 
        tested in large military exercises. The United States has 
        deployed an AN/TPY-2 radar in Israel to enhance missile defense 
        against missiles from Iran.
            (15) The United States is working with the nations of the 
        Gulf Cooperation Council on enhanced national and regional 
        missile defense capabilities against growing missile threats 
        from Iran. As part of this effort, the United Arab Emirates 
        plans to purchase two batteries of the Terminal High Altitude 
        Air Defense (THAAD) system, as well as other equipment.
            (16) The United States has a strong program of missile 
        defense cooperation with Japan, including the co-development of 
        the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA interceptor for the 
        Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system, intended to be deployed 
        by Japan and in Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive 
        Approach, Japan's fleet of Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense 
        ships using the SM-3 Block IA interceptors, and the United 
        States deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the threat from regional ballistic missiles, 
        particularly from Iran and North Korea, is serious and growing, 
        and puts at risk forward-deployed United States forces and 
        allies and partners in Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-
        Pacific region;
            (2) the Department of Defense has an obligation to provide 
        force protection of forward-deployed United States forces, 
        assets, and facilities from regional ballistic missile attack;
            (3) the United States has an obligation to meet its 
        security commitments to its allies, including ballistic missile 
        defense commitments;
            (4) the Department of Defense has a balanced program of 
        investment and capabilities to provide for both homeland 
        defense and regional defense against ballistic missiles, 
        consistent with the Ballistic Missile Defense Review and with 
        the prioritized and integrated needs of the commanders of the 
        combatant commands;
            (5) the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile 
        defense is an appropriate and necessary response to the 
        existing and growing ballistic missile threat from Iran to 
        forward deployed United States forces and allies and partners 
        in Europe;
            (6) the Department of Defense--
                    (A) should, as a high priority, continue to 
                develop, test, and plan to deploy all four phases of 
                the European Phased Adaptive Approach, including all 
                variants of the Standard Missile-3 interceptor; and
                    (B) should also continue with its other phased and 
                adaptive regional missile defense efforts tailored to 
                the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region;
            (7) European members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization are making valuable contributions to missile 
        defense in Europe, by hosting elements of United States missile 
        defense systems on their territories, through individual 
        national contributions to missile defense capability, and by 
        collective funding and development of the Active Layered 
        Theater Ballistic Missile Defense system; and
            (8) the Department of Defense should continue with the 
        development of the key enablers of enhanced regional missile 
        defense, including the Precision Tracking Space System.

                combatant commands in an affordable and balanced 
                manner.
                    (C) A description of the progress made in the

            (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
        annex.

SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) For more than a decade, the United States and Russia 
        have discussed a variety of options for cooperation on shared 
        early warning and ballistic missile defense. For example, on 
        May 1, 2001, President George W. Bush spoke of a ``new 
        cooperative relationship'' with Russia and said ``it should be 
        premised on openness, mutual confidence and real opportunities 
        for cooperation, including the area of missile defense. It 
        should allow us to share information so that each nation can 
        improve its early warning capability, and its capability to 
        defend its people and territory. And perhaps one day, we can 
        even cooperate in a joint defense''.
            (2) Section 1231 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law by 
        Public Law 106-398; 1654A-329) authorized the Department of 
        Defense to establish in Russia a ``joint center for the 
        exchange of data from systems to provide early warning of 
        launches of ballistic missiles and for notification of launches 
        of such missiles'', also known as the Joint Data Exchange 
        Center (JDEC).
            (3) On March 31, 2008, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon 
        England stated that ``we have offered Russia a wide-ranging 
        proposal to cooperate on missile defense--everything from 
        modeling and simulation, to data sharing, to joint development 
        of a regional missile defense architecture--all designed to 
        defend the United States, Europe, and Russia from the growing 
        threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. An extraordinary series 
        of transparency measures have also been offered to reassure 
        Russia. Despite some Russian reluctance to sign up to these 
        cooperative missile defense activities, we continue to work 
        toward this goal''.
            (4) On July 6, 2009, President Barack Obama and Russian 
        President Dmitry Medvedev issued a joint statement on missile 
        defense issues, which stated that ``Russia and the United 
        States plan to continue the discussion concerning the 
        establishment of cooperation in responding to the challenge of 
        ballistic missile proliferation. . . We have instructed our 
        experts to work together to analyze the ballistic missile 
        challenges of the 21st century and to prepare appropriate 
        recommendations''.
            (5) The February 2010 report of the Ballistic Missile 
        Defense Review established as one of its central policy pillars 
        that increased international missile defense cooperation is in 
        the national security interest of the United States and, with 
        regard to cooperation with Russia, the United States ``is 
        pursuing a broad agenda focused on shared early warning of 
        missile launches, possible technical cooperation, and even 
        operational cooperation''.
            (6) at the November 2010 Lisbon Summit, the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to develop a missile defense 
        system to ``protect NATO European populations, territory and 
        forces'' and also to seek cooperation with Russia on missile 
        defense. In its Lisbon Summit Declaration, the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization reaffirmed its readiness to ``invite Russia 
        to explore jointly the potential for linking current and 
        planned missile defence systems at an appropriate time in 
        mutually beneficial ways''. The new NATO Strategic Concept 
        adopted at the Lisbon Summit states that ``we will actively 
        seek cooperation on missile defense with Russia'', that ``NATO-
        Russia cooperation is of strategic importance'', and that ``the 
        security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia 
        is intertwined''.
            (7) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the leadership of the 
        Senate, President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization ``invited Russia to cooperate on missile defense, 
        which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to those 
        deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against common 
        threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the 
        Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving 
        NATO-Russian relations. This comes even as we have made clear 
        that the system we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a 
        joint system, and it will not in any way limit United States' 
        or NATO's missile defense capabilities. Effective cooperation 
        with Russia could enhance the overall efficiency of our 
        combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time 
        provide Russia with greater security''.
            (8) Section 221(a)(3) of the Ike Skelton National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 124 
        Stat. 4167) states that it is the sense of Congress ``to 
        support the efforts of the United States Government and the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation with 
        the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense relative to 
        Iranian missile threats''.
            (9) In a speech in Russia on March 21, 2011, Secretary of 
        Defense Robert Gates cited ``the NATO-Russian decision to 
        cooperate on defense against ballistic missiles. We've 
        disagreed before, and Russia still has uncertainties about the 
        European Phased Adaptive Approach, a limited system that poses 
        no challenges to the large Russian nuclear arsenal. However, 
        we've mutually committed to resolving these difficulties in 
        order to develop a roadmap toward truly effective anti-
        ballistic missile collaboration. This collaboration may include 
        exchanging launch information, setting up a joint data fusion 
        center, allowing greater transparency with respect to our 
        missile defense plans and exercises, and conducting a joint 
        analysis to determine areas of future cooperation''.
            (10) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        Senate on April 13, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
        for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Bradley H. Roberts 
        stated that the United States has been pursuing a Defense 
        Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia since 2004, and 
        that such an agreement is necessary ``for the safeguarding of 
        sensitive information in support of cooperation'' on missile 
        defense, and to ``provide the legal framework for undertaking 
        cooperative efforts''. Further, Dr. Roberts stated that the 
        United States would not provide any classified information to 
        Russia without first conducting a National Disclosure Policy 
        review. He also stated that the United States is not 
        considering sharing ``hit-to-kill'' technology with Russia.
            (11) In a March 2012 answer to a question from the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on missile defense 
        cooperation with Russia, Acting Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Policy Jim Miller wrote that ``I support U.S.-Russian 
        cooperation on missile defenses first and foremost because it 
        could improve the effectiveness of U.S. and NATO missile 
        defenses, thereby improving the protection of the United 
        States, our forces overseas, and our Allies. Missile defense 
        cooperation with Russia is in the security interests of the 
        United States, NATO, and Russia, first and foremost because it 
        could strengthen capabilities across Europe to intercept 
        Iranian missiles''. He also wrote that ``[t]he United States 
        has pursued missile defense cooperation with Russia with the 
        clear understanding that we would not accept constraints on 
        missile defense, and that we would undertake necessary 
        qualitative and quantitative improvements to meet U.S. Security 
        needs''.
            (12) In February 2012, an international group of 
        independent experts known as the Euro-Atlantic Security 
        Initiative issued a report proposing missile defense 
        cooperation between the United States (with its North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization allies) and Russia. The group, whose 
        leaders included Stephen Hadley, the National Security Advisor 
        to President George W. Bush, proposed that the nations share 
        satellite and radar early warning data at joint cooperation 
        centers in order to improve their ability to detect, track, and 
        defeat medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles 
        from the Middle East.
            (13) In a letter dated April 13, 2012, Robert Nabors, 
        Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of 
        Legislative Affairs, wrote that ``it is Administration policy 
        that we will only provide information to Russia that will 
        enhance the effectiveness of our missile defenses. The 
        Administration will not provide Russia with sensitive 
        information that would in any way compromise our national 
        security, including hit-to-kill technology and interceptor 
        telemetry''.
            (14) The United States and Russia already engage in 
        substantial cooperation on a number of international security 
        efforts, including nuclear nonproliferation, anti-piracy, 
        counter-narcotics, nuclear security, counter-terrorism, and 
        logistics resupply through Russia of coalition forces in 
        Afghanistan. These areas of cooperation require each side to 
        share and protect sensitive information, which they have both 
        done successfully.
            (15) The United States currently has shared early warning 
        agreements and programs of cooperation with eight nations in 
        addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The United 
        States has developed procedures and mechanisms for sharing 
        early warning information with partner nations while ensuring 
        the protection of sensitive United States information.
            (16) Russia and the United States each have missile launch 
        early warning and detection and tracking sensors that could 
        contribute to and enhance each others' ability to detect, 
        track, an defend against ballistic missile threats from Iran.
            (17) The Obama Administration has provided regular 
        briefings to Congress on its discussions with Russia on 
        possible missile defense cooperation.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with 
        Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, 
        its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and Russia, 
        particularly against missile threats from Iran;
            (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile 
        defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral basis and a 
        multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia Council;
            (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not ``in 
        any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense 
        capabilities'', as acknowledged in the December 18, 2010, 
        letter from President Obama to the leadership of the Senate, 
        and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature;
            (4) the United States should not provide Russia with 
        sensitive missile defense information that would in any way 
        compromise United States national security, including ``hit-to-
        kill'' technology and interceptor telemetry; and
            (5) the United States should pursue missile defense 
        cooperation with Russia in a manner that ensures that--
                    (A) United States classified information is 
                appropriately safeguarded and protected from 
                unauthorized disclosure;
                    (B) prior to sharing classified information with 
                Russia, the United States conducts a National 
                Disclosure Policy review and determines the types and 
                levels of information that may be shared and whether 
                any additional procedures are necessary to protect such 
                information;
                    (C) prior to entering into missile defense 
                technology cooperation projects, the United States 
                enters into a Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement 
                with Russia that establishes the legal framework for a 
                broad spectrum of potential cooperative defense 
                projects; and
                    (D) such cooperation does not limit the missile 
                defense capabilities of the United States or its North 
                Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.

                previous Multiple Kill Vehicle technology development 
                program;
                    (D) seeks to maximize, to the greatest extent 
                practicable, commonality between subsystems of a next 
                generation Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle and other exo-
                atmospheric kill vehicle programs; and
                    (E) meets Department of Defense criteria, as 
                established in the February 2010 Ballistic Missile 
                Defense Review, for affordability, reliability, 
                suitability, and operational effectiveness to defend 
                against limited attacks from evolving and future 
                threats from long-range missiles.
            (2) Evaluation of payloads.--The assessment required by 
        paragraph (1) shall include an evaluation of the potential 
        benefits and drawbacks of options for both unitary and multiple 
        Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle payloads.
            (3) Standard missile-3 block iib interceptor.--As part of 
        the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Director shall 
        evaluate whether there are potential options and opportunities 
        arising from the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptor 
        development program for development of an exo-atmospheric kill 
        vehicle, or kill vehicle technologies or components, that could 
        be used for potential upgrades to the Ground-Based Interceptor 
        or for a next generation Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of

SEC. 239. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE SUBMITTAL TO CONGRESS OF THE 
              HOMELAND DEFENSE HEDGING POLICY AND STRATEGY REPORT OF 
              THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1340) 
        requires a homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report 
        from the Secretary of Defense.
            (2) The report was required to be submitted not later than 
        75 days after the date of the enactment of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, namely by March 16, 
        2012.
            (3) The Secretary of Defense has not yet submitted the 
        report as required.
            (4) In March 2012, General Charles Jacoby, Jr., Commander 
        of the United States Northern Command, the combatant command 
        responsible for operation of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system to defend the homeland against ballistic missile 
        threats, testified before Congress that ``I am confident in my 
        ability to successfully defend the homeland from the current 
        set of limited long-range ballistic missile threats'', and that 
        ``[a]gainst current threats from the Middle East, I am 
        confident we are well postured''.
            (5) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) 
        is intended to augment the currently deployed homeland defense 
        capability of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system against 
        a potential future Iranian long-range missile threat by 
        deploying an additional layer of forward-deployed interceptors 
        in Europe in the 2020 timeframe.
            (6) The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, 
        has testified to Congress that, although the intelligence 
        community does ``not know if Iran will eventually decide to 
        build nuclear weapons'', it judges ``that Iran would likely 
        choose missile delivery as its preferred method of delivering a 
        nuclear weapon''. He also testified that ``Iran already has the 
        largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, and 
        it is expanding the scale, reach, and sophistication of its 
        ballistic missile forces, many of which are inherently capable 
        of carrying a nuclear payload''.
            (7) The 2012 Annual Report to Congress on the Military 
        Power of Iran by the Department of Defense states that, in 
        addition to increasing its missile inventories, ``Iran has 
        boosted the lethality and effectiveness of its existing missile 
        systems with accuracy improvements and new submunitions 
        payloads'', and that it continues to develop missiles that can 
        strike Israel and Eastern Europe. It also states that ``Iran 
        has launched multistage space launch vehicles that could serve 
        as a testbed for developing long-range ballistic missiles 
        technologies'', and that ``[w]ith sufficient foreign 
        assistance, Iran may be technically capable of flight-testing 
        an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015''.
            (8) Despite the failure of its April 2012 satellite launch 
        attempt, North Korea warned the United States in October 2012 
        that the United States mainland is within range of its 
        missiles.
            (9) The threat of limited ballistic missile attack against 
        the United States homeland from countries such as North Korea 
        and Iran is increasing.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report 
        required by section 233 of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 2012 is necessary to inform Congress on 
        options to protect the United States homeland against the 
        evolving ballistic missile threat, including potential options 
        prior to the deployment of Phase 4 of the European Phased 
        Adaptive Approach to missile defense; and
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should comply with the 
        requirements of section 233 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 by submitting the 
        homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report to 
        Congress.

SEC. 272. SENSE OF SENATE ON INCREASING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF 
              TRAINING EXERCISES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) modeling and simulation will continue to play a 
        critical role in the training of the members of the Armed 
        Forces;
            (2) while increased modeling and simulation has reduced 
        overall costs of training of members of the Armed Forces, there 
        are still significant costs associated with the human resources 
        required to execute certain training exercises where role-
        playing actors for certain characters such as opposing forces, 
        the civilian populace, other government agencies, and non-
        governmental organizations are required;
            (3) technological advances in areas such as varying levels 
        of autonomy for systems, multi-player gaming techniques, and 
        artificial intelligence could reduce the number of personnel 
        required to support certain training exercises for members of 
        the Armed Forces, and thereby reduce the overall cost of the 
        exercises; and
            (4) the Secretary of Defense should develop a plan to 
        increase the use of emerging technologies in autonomous 
        systems, the commercial gaming sector, and artificial 
        intelligence for training exercises for members of the Armed 
        Forces to increase training effectiveness and reduce costs.

core values of each Armed Force under the jurisdiction of such 
Secretary.
    (d) Consultation.--Not less than annually, the Secretary of Defense 
shall meet with the Secretaries of the military departments, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and senior enlisted members of the Armed Forces to 
discuss the progress being made toward developing and implementing the 
plan established under subsection (a).

        audit reports and supporting materials, that are relevant to 
        such assessment; and
            (2) provide that the refusal of a contractor to permit 
        access to contractor internal audit reports and supporting 
        materials that are relevant to such an assessment is a basis 
        for disapproving the contractor business system or systems to 
        which such materials are relevant and taking the remedial 
        actions authorized under section 893.

        a complaint under subsection (b), or in the case of an 
        extension of time under paragraph (b)(2)(B), not later than 30 
        days after the expiration of the extension of time, and there

        complainant, the complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted 
        all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint, and 
        the complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity

        enforcement of such order in the United States district court 
        for a district in which the reprisal was found to have 
        occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court 
        may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, 
        compensatory and exemplary damages, and attorney fees and 
        costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may 
        also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head 
        of the executive agency.

        aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain 
        review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and any

        States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is 
        alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such 
        review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the 
        order by the head of the executive agency. Review shall conform

        Government, including critical knowledge or institutional 
        memory of key operations areas and subject-matter expertise.

        risk assessment for the operation performed under subsection

                contractor performance of critical functions;
                    (B) measurable milestones for the implementation of 
                planned risk mitigation or risk reduction measures; and

              NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION MEMBER NATIONS TO THE 
              SUCCESS OF THE NORTHERN DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The remote and austere environments in which United 
        States troops are required to operate as part of the 
        International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in 
        Afghanistan have increased the need for reliable lines of 
        supply in southwest Asia.
            (2) The country of Afghanistan presents unique logistics 
        challenges, which have precipitated the development of several 
        redundant lines of supply.
            (3) United States Transportation Command and the Defense 
        Logistics Agency (DLA), in consultation with United States 
        Embassy officials and other parties, have successfully 
        established memoranda of understanding and other agreements 
        with nations in and around southwest Asia to ensure the 
        reliability of lines of supply to Afghanistan.
            (4) The lines of supply through Pakistan have been 
        repeatedly threatened by instability in that country. 
        Airlifting goods to Afghanistan, while safer, is expensive.
            (5) The Northern Distribution Network (NDN) was established 
        in late 2008 to ensure that a safe and cost-effective line of 
        supply is available for United States troops in Afghanistan.
            (6) The two prongs of supply provided by the Northern 
        Distribution Network ship nonlethal goods from the Baltic ports 
        in the north and the Caucauses in the west to southwest Asia 
        and Afghanistan.
            (7) The Northern Distribution Network has been successful 
        and now handles more than 50 percent of cargo shipped to 
        Afghanistan.
            (8) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member 
        nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes have 
        contributed significantly to the success of the Northern 
        Distribution Network.
            (9) The United States has strong economic ties to Northern 
        Distribution Network nations that are members of the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization, and these nations may be able to 
        provide quality goods and services for near and long-term use 
        by the Department of Defense.
            (10) Since 2009 the port of Riga, on the Baltic Sea, has 
        been a critical overland entry point for goods being shipped 
        using the Northern Distribution Network. Latvia is a member of 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and has been an ally of 
        the United States in the region for many years.
            (11) In September 2010, the Defense Logistics Agency, the 
        General Services Administration, and other parties hosted a 
        local procurement conference in Riga, Latvia.
            (12) One hundred nine Latvian vendors attended the 
        September 2010 conference in Riga, and contracts with Latvian 
        vendors have been entered into as a result.
            (13) In May 2012, Latvia hosted an international workshop 
        in Riga to examine ways of transforming the Northern 
        Distribution Network from a route for the delivery of United 
        States and other Allies' non-lethal goods to Afghanistan into a 
        commercial route that would support the economic growth of 
        Afghanistan and the southwest Asia region.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes 
        are key economic and security partners of the United States and 
        are to be commended for their contribution to ensuring United 
        States and International Security Assistance Force troops have 
        reliable lines of supply to achieve the mission in Afghanistan;
            (2) when quality products at competitive prices are 
        available, significant effort should be made to procure goods 
        locally from Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization member nations along the Northern Distribution 
        Network routes; and
            (3) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes 
        remain allies of the United States in the region, and a 
        mutually beneficial relationship should continue to be 
        cultivated between the United States and Latvia and such other 
        nations in the future.

        report pursuant to paragraph (1), the head of the executive 
        agency shall make a written determination whether the recipient 
        of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement; any subgrantee

        access to, enterprise-level services.
            (7) Separation of server and end-user device computing to 
        facilitate server and data center consolidation and a more 
        secure tiered and zoned network architecture.
    (b) Personnel Plan.--
            (1) In general.--As part of the actions taken under 
        subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish and carry out a 
        plan to reassign personnel billets currently allocated to 
        network operations and security that will become available 
        pursuant to the reduction in network enclaves required by that 
        subsection to tasks related to potential offensive cyber 
        operations in order to achieve an appropriate balance between 
        the offensive and defensive missions of the United States Cyber 
        Command and its components. The plan shall include targets for 
        the number of personnel to be reassigned to tasks related to 
        offensive operations, and the rate at which such personnel 
        shall be added to the workforce for such tasks.
            (2) Disposition of personnel.--In developing the plan 
        required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall--
                    (A) determine whether the number of personnel 
                required to be reassigned to tasks related to offensive 
                operations in order to achieve the balance described in 
                paragraph (1) will be met, in pace and numbers, through 
                the reassignment of personnel billets pursuant to the 
                plan; and
                    (B) if the Secretary determines that the number of 
                personnel so required will not be so met (whether 
                because of insufficient numbers of personnel in billets 
                to be reassigned or because personnel available for 
                reassignment cannot be trained or directed to tasks 
                related to offensive operations), take appropriate 
                actions to ensure the availability to the United States 
                Cyber Command of appropriate numbers of personnel 
                qualified to undertake tasks related to offensive 
                operations.
            (3) Additional elements.--In developing the plan required 
        by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall also--
                    (A) identify targets for the number of personnel to 
                be reassigned to tasks related to offensive cyber 
                operations, and the rate at which such personnel shall 
                be added to the workforce for such tasks; and
                    (B) identify targets for use of National Guard 
                personnel to support cyber workforce rationalization 
                and the actions taken under subsection (a).
            (4) Submittal to congress.--The Secretary shall submit the 
        plan required by paragraph (1) to the congressional defense 
        committees at the time of the submittal to Congress of the 
        budget of the President for fiscal year 2014 pursuant to

SEC. 924. NEXT-GENERATION HOST-BASED CYBER SECURITY SYSTEM FOR THE 
              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Strategy for Acquisition of System Required.--The Chief 
Information Officer of the Department of Defense shall, in coordination 
with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and 
Logistics, develop a strategy to acquire next-generation host-based 
cybersecurity tools and capabilities (in this section referred to as a 
``next-generation system'') for the Department of Defense.
    (b) Elements of System.--It is the sense of Congress that any next-
generation system acquired under the strategy required by subsection 
(a) should meet the following requirements:
            (1) To overcome problems and limitations in current 
        capabilities, the system should not rely on anti-virus or 
        signature-based threat detection techniques that--
                    (A) cannot address new or rapidly morphing threats:
                    (B) consume substantial amounts of communications 
                capacity to remain current with known threats and to 
                report current status; or
                    (C) consume substantial amounts of resources to 
                store rapidly growing threat libraries.
            (2) The system should provide an open architecture-based 
        framework for so-called ``plug-and-play'' integration of a 
        variety of types of deployable tools in addition to cyber 
        intrusion detection tools, including tools for--
                    (A) insider threat detection;
                    (B) continuous monitoring and configuration 
                management;
                    (C) remediation following infections; and
                    (D) protection techniques that do not rely on 
                detection of the attack, such as virtualization, and 
                diversification of attack surfaces.
            (3) The system should be designed for ease of deployment to 
        potentially millions of host devices of tailored security 
        solutions depending on need and risk, and to be compatible with 
        cloud-based, thin-client, and virtualized environments as well 
        as battlefield devices and weapons systems.
    (c) Submittal to Congress.--The Chief Information Office shall 
submit to Congress a report setting forth the strategy required by 
subsection (a) together with the budget justification materials of the 
Department of Defense submitted to Congress with the budget of the 
President for fiscal year 2015 pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, 
United States Code.

SEC. 934. SENSE OF SENATE ON POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS TO DEPARTMENT OF 
              DEFENSE NETWORKS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Cybersecurity threats are pervasive and serious, 
        including through the supply chain of information technology 
        equipment and software.
            (2) Semiconductor manufacturing is already dominated by 
        foreign producers, presenting supply chain risk management 
        challenges.
            (3) In a number of instances, foreign manufacturers of 
        telecommunications equipment, including advanced wireless 
        technology, are gaining global market share due to high quality 
        and low prices. Competitive market forces ensure that 
        commercial providers of consumer, business, and government 
        systems and services will choose equipment and associated 
        software from these manufacturers. In some cases, like Huawei 
        Industries, this competitive position stems in part from 
        inappropriate government subsidies and other forms of 
        assistance.
            (4) Some of these companies also present clear 
        cybersecurity supply chain risks that the Government must 
        address.
            (5) The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United 
        States has blocked the attempt by Huawei to acquire United 
        States technology firms on two occasions and the National 
        Security Agency and the Secretary of Commerce have advised two 
        major United States telecommunications carriers against 
        selecting Huawei as a supplier.
            (6) The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383) provided authority and 
        mechanisms for the Secretary of Defense to control these supply 
        chain risks, but only for National Security Systems, leaving 
        many information technology systems and missions exposed to 
        supply chain risks.
            (7) Blocking sales from providers of information technology 
        systems and services due to concerns about cybersecurity risks, 
        while maintaining our commitment to free trade and fair and 
        transparent competition, poses difficult policy challenges.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Department of Defense--
            (1) must ensure it maintains full visibility and adequate 
        control of its supply chain, including subcontractors, in order 
        to mitigate supply chain exploitation; and
            (2) needs the authority and capability to mitigate supply 
        chain risks to its information technology systems that fall 
        outside the scope of National Security Systems.

SEC. 935. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On June 23, 2009, the Secretary of Defense directed the 
        Commander of the United States Strategic Command to establish 
        the United States Cyber Command, which became operational on 
        May 21, 2010, and operates as a sub-unified command subordinate 
        to the United States Strategic Command.
            (2) In May 2012, media reports indicated that General 
        Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
        planned to recommend to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta that 
        the two-year-old United States Cyber Command be elevated to 
        full combatant command status.
            (3) On August 14, 2012, General Keith Alexander, the 
        Commander of the United States Cyber Command and the Director 
        of the National Security Agency, addressed the TechNet Land 
        Forces conference and stated that ``[i]n 2007 we drafted . . . 
        a paper . . . about establishing a Cyber Command . . . [which 
        concluded that] . . . the most logical is to set it up as a sub 
        unified and grow it to a unified, and I think that's the 
        process that we're going to work our way through''.
            (4) On October 11, 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta 
        discussed cybersecurity in a speech to the Business Executives 
        for National Security in New York, New York, specifically 
        calling for a strengthening of the United States Cyber Command 
        and stating that the Department of Defense ``must ensure that 
        [the United States Cyber Command] has the resources, that it 
        has the authorities, that it has the capabilities required to 
        perform this growing mission. And it must also be able to react 
        quickly to events unfolding in cyberspace and help fully 
        integrate cyber into all of the department's plans and 
        activities.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the serious cyber threat to national

            (2) acknowledges the importance of the unified command 
        structure of the Department in directing military operations in 
        cyberspace and recognizes that a change in the status of the 
        United States Cyber Command has Department-wide and national 
        security implications, which require careful consideration;
            (3) expects to be briefed and consulted about any proposal 
        to elevate the United States Cyber Command to a unified command 
        before a decision by the Secretary make such a proposal to the 
        President and to receive, at a minimum--

                Cyber Command to a unified command;
                    (C) an estimate of the cost of creating a unified 
                United States Cyber Command and a justification of the 
                expenditure; and
                    (D) if the Secretary considers it advisable to 
                continue the designation of the Commander of the United 
                States Cyber Command as also being the Director of the 
                National Security Agency--
                            (i) an explanation of how a single 
                        individual could serve as a commander of a 
                        combatant command that conducts overt, albeit 
                        clandestine, cyber operations under title 10, 
                        United States Code, as well as the director of

                        Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in a manner 
                        that affords deniability to the United States; 
                        and
                            (ii) a statement of whether the Secretary 
                        believes it is appropriate either to appoint a 
                        line officer as the Director of the National 
                        Security Agency or to take the unprecedented 
                        step of appointing an intelligence officer as a 
                        unified commander; and
            (4) believes that appropriate policy foundations and 
        standing rules of engagement must be in place before any 
        decision to create a unified United States Cyber Command.

SEC. 1004. REPORT ON EFFECTS OF BUDGET SEQUESTRATION ON THE DEPARTMENT 
              OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The inability of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit 
        Reduction to find $1,200,000,000,000 in savings will trigger 
        automatic funding reductions known as ``sequestration'' to the 
        Department of Defense of $492,000,000,000 between 2013 and 2021 
        under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985 (2 USC 901a).
            (2) These reductions are in addition to reductions of 
        $487,000,000,000 already being implemented by the Department of 
        Defense, and would decrease the readiness and capabilities of 
        the Armed Forces while increasing risks to the effective 
        implementation of the National Security Strategy of the United 
        States.
            (3) The leaders of the Department of Defense have 
        consistently testified that threats to the national security of 
        the United States have increased, not decreased. Secretary of 
        Defense Leon Panetta said that these reductions would ``inflict 
        severe damage to our national defense for generations'', 
        comments that have been echoed by the Secretaries of the Army, 
        Navy, and Air Force.
            (4) While reductions in funds available for the Department 
        of Defense will automatically commence January 2, 2013, 
        uncertainty regarding the reductions has already exacerbated 
        Department of Defense efforts to plan future defense budget.
            (5) Sequestration will have a detrimental effect on the 
        industrial base that supports the Department of Defense.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than August 15, 2012, the 
        Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed 
        Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a 
        detailed report on the impact on the Department of Defense of 
        the sequestration of funds authorized and appropriated for 
        fiscal year 2013 for the Department of Defense, if 
        automatically triggered on January 2, 2013, under section 251A 
        of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
        1985.
            (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) An assessment of the potential impact of 
                sequestration on the readiness of the Armed Forces, 
                including impacts to steaming hours, flying hours, and 
                full spectrum training miles, and an estimate of the 
                increase or decrease in readiness (as defined in the C 
                status C-1 through C-5).
                    (B) An assessment of the potential impact of 
                sequestration on the ability of the Department of 
                Defense to carry out the National Military Strategy of 
                the United States, and any changes to the most recent 
                Risk Assessment of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
                Staff under section 153(b) of title 10, United States 
                Code arising from sequestration.
                    (C) A list of the programs, projects, and 
                activities across the Department of Defense, the 
                military departments, and the elements and components 
                of the Department of Defense that would be reduced or 
                terminated as a result of sequestration.
                    (D) An estimate of the number and value of all 
                contracts that will be terminated, restructured, or 
                revised in scope as a result of sequestration, 
                including an estimate of potential termination costs 
                and of increased contract costs due to renegotiation 
                and reinstatement of contracts.

SEC. 1023. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RECAPITALIZATION FOR THE NAVY AND COAST 
              GUARD.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) More than 70 percent of the world's surface is 
        comprised of navigable oceans.
            (2) More than 80 percent of the population of the world 
        lives within 100 miles of an ocean.
            (3) More than 90 percent of the world's commerce traverses 
        an oceans.
            (4) The national security of the United States is 
        inextricably linked to the maintenance of global freedom of 
        access for both the strategic and commercial interests of the 
        United States.
            (5) To maintain that freedom of access the sea services of 
        the United States, composed of the Navy, the Marine Corps, and 
        the Coast Guard, must be sufficiently positioned as 
        rotationally globally deployable forces with the capability to 
        decisively defend United States citizens, homeland, and 
        interests abroad from direct or asymmetric attack and must be 
        comprised of sufficient vessels to maintain global freedom of 
        action.
            (6) To achieve appropriate capabilities to ensure national 
        security the Government of the United States must continue to 
        recapitalize the fleets of the Navy and Coast Guard and must 
        continue to conduct vital maintenance and repair of existing 
        vessels to ensure such vessels meet service life goals.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the sea services of the United States should be funded 
        and maintained to provide the broad spectrum of capabilities 
        required to protect the national security of the United States;
            (2) such capabilities should include--
                    (A) the ability to project United States power 
                rapidly anywhere on the globe without the need for host 
                nation basing permission or long and potentially 
                vulnerable logistics supply lines;
                    (B) the ability to land and recover maritime forces 
                from the sea for direct combat action, to evacuate 
                United States citizens from hostile situations, and to 
                provide humanitarian assistance where needed;
                    (C) the ability to operate from the subsurface with 
                overpowering conventional combat power, as well as 
                strategic deterrence; and
                    (D) the ability to operate in collaboration with 
                United States maritime partners in the common interest 
                of preventing piracy at sea and maintaining the 
                commercial sea lanes available for global commerce;
            (3) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
        Secretary of the Navy, should maintain the recapitalization 
        plans for the Navy as a priority in all future force structure 
        decisions; and
            (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security should maintain the 
        recapitalization plans for the Coast Guard as a priority in all 
        future force structure decisions.

SEC. 1024. NOTICE TO CONGRESS FOR THE REVIEW OF PROPOSALS TO NAME NAVAL 
              VESSELS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Navy traces its ancestry to October 13, 1775, when 
        an Act of the Continental Congress authorized the first vessel 
        of a navy for the United Colonies. Vessels of the Continental 
        Navy were named for early patriots and military heroes, Federal 
        institutions, colonial cities, and positive character traits 
        representative of naval and military virtues.
            (2) An Act of Congress on March 3, 1819, made the Secretary 
        of the Navy responsible for assigning names to vessels of the 
        Navy. Traditional sources for vessel names customarily 
        encompassed such categories as geographic locations in the 
        United States; historic sites, battles, and ships; naval and 
        military heroes and leaders; and noted individuals who made 
        distinguished contributions to United States national security.
            (3) These customs and traditions provide appropriate and 
        necessary standards for the naming of vessels of the Navy.
    (b) Notice to Congress.--Section 7292 of title 10, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(d)(1) The Secretary of the Navy may not announce or implement 
any proposal to name a vessel of the Navy until 30 days after the date 
on which the Secretary submits to the Committees on Armed Services of 
the Senate and the House of Representatives a report setting forth such 
proposal.
    ``(2) Each report under this subsection shall describe the 
justification for the proposal covered by such report in accordance 
with the standards referred to in section 1024(a) of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--This section and the amendment made by this 
section shall go into effect on the date that is 30 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 1064. REPORT ON PROGRAM ON RETURN OF RARE EARTH PHOSPHORS FROM 
              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FLUORESCENT LIGHTING WASTE TO THE 
              DOMESTIC RARE EARTH SUPPLY CHAIN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In its December 2011 report entitled ``Critical 
        Materials Strategy'', the Department of Energy states that the 
        heavy rare earth phosphors, dysprosium, europium, terbium, and 
        yttrium, are particularly important given their relative 
        scarcity and their importance to clean energy, energy 
        efficiency, hybrid and electric vehicles, and advanced defense 
        systems, among other key technologies.
            (2) While new sources of production of rare earth elements 
        show promise, these are focused primarily on the light rare 
        earth elements.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the recycling of end-use technologies that use rare 
        earth elements can provide near-term opportunities to 
        recapture, reprocess, and reuse some of the rare earth elements 
        contained in them;
            (2) fluorescent lighting materials could prove to be a 
        promising recyclable source of heavy rare earth elements;
            (3) a cost-benefit analysis would be helpful in determining 
        the viability of a Department of Defense program to recycle 
        fluorescent lighting waste in order to increase its supplies of 
        heavy rare earth elements; and
            (4) the recycling of heavy rare earth elements may be one 
        component of a long term strategic plan to address the global 
        demand for such elements, without which such elements could be 
        unnecessarily lost.
    (c) Report Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than March 1, 2013, the 
        Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense 
        committees a report on the results of a cost-benefit analysis 
        on, and on recommendations concerning, the feasibility and 
        advisability of establishing a program within the Department of 
        Defense to--
                    (A) recapture fluorescent lighting waste; and
                    (B) make such waste available to entities that have 
                the ability to extract rare earth phosphors, reprocess 
                and separate them in an environmentally safe manner, 
                and return them to the domestic rare earth supply 
                chain.
            (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall 
        include analysis of measures that could be taken to--
                    (A) provide for the disposal and mitigation of 
                residual mercury and other hazardous byproducts to be 
                produced by the recycling process; and
                    (B) address concerns regarding the potential export 
                of heavy rare earth materials obtained from United 
                States Government sources to non-allied nations.

SEC. 1065. REPORT ON ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT ARMED FORCES HISTORICAL

assessment of the current capacities and qualities of the historical 
storage and preservation facilities of each of the Armed Forces,

        for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, including the loss of a 
        specialized workforce and supplier base.

SEC. 1071. STRATEGIC DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Nuclear Posture Review of 2010 said, with respect 
        to modernizing the triad, ``for planned reductions under New 
        START, the United States should retain a smaller Triad of 
        SLBMs, ICBMs, and heavy bombers. Retaining all three Triad legs 
        will best maintain strategic stability at reasonable cost, 
        while hedging against potential technical problems or 
        vulnerabilities''.
            (2) The Senate stated in Declaration 12 of the Resolution 
        of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the New START Treaty 
        that ``In accordance with paragraph 1 of Article V of the New 
        START Treaty, which states that, `Subject to the provisions of 
        this Treaty, modernization and replacement of strategic 
        offensive arms may be carried out,' it is the sense of the 
        Senate that United States deterrence and flexibility is assured 
        by a robust triad of strategic delivery vehicles. To this end, 
        the United States is committed to accomplishing the 
        modernization and replacement of its strategic nuclear delivery 
        vehicles, and to ensuring the continued flexibility of United 
        States conventional and nuclear delivery systems''.
            (3) The Senate required the President, prior to the entry 
        into force of the New START Treaty, to certify to the Senate 
        that the President intended to modernize or replace the triad 
        of strategic nuclear delivery systems.
            (4) The President made this certification in a message to 
        the Senate on February 2, 2011, in which the President stated, 
        ``I intend to (a) modernize or replace the triad of strategic 
        nuclear delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air-launched 
        cruise missile, an ICBM, and a nuclear-powered ballistic 
        missile submarine (SSBN) and SLBM; and (b) maintain the United 
        States rocket motor industrial base''.
    (b) Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--Chapter 23 of title 10, United States 
        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new

SEC. 1083. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NON-UNITED STATES CITIZENS WHO ARE 
              GRADUATES OF UNITED STATES EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WITH 
              ADVANCED DEGREES IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND 
              MATHEMATICS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) It is a national security concern that more than half 
        of all graduates with advanced scientific and technical degrees 
        from United States institutions of higher education are non-
        United States citizens who have very limited opportunities upon 
        graduation to contribute to the science and technology 
        activities of the Department of Defense and the United States 
        defense industrial base.
            (2) The capabilities of the Armed Forces are highly reliant 
        upon advanced technologies that provide our forces with a 
        technological edge on the battlefield.
            (3) In order to maintain and advance our military 
        technological superiority, the United States requires the best 
        and brightest scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to 
        discover, develop, and field the next generation of weapon 
        systems and defense technologies.
            (4) The Department of Defense and the defense industrial 
        base compete with other sectors for a limited number of United 
        States citizens who have appropriate advanced degrees and 
        skills.
            (5) While an overarching national priority is to increase 
        the numbers of United States citizens who have appropriate 
        advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics (STEM), it would be beneficial if the Department of 
        Defense and the defense industrial base were able to access the 
        pool of talent of non-United States citizens with advanced 
        scientific and technical degrees from United States 
        institutions of higher education, many of whom are otherwise 
        returning to their home countries.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) that the Department of Defense should make every 
        reasonable and practical effort to increase the number of 
        United States citizens who pursue advanced degrees in science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics; and
            (2) to strongly urge the Department of Defense to 
        investigate innovative mechanisms (subject to all appropriate 
        security requirements) to access to the pool of talent of non-
        United States citizens with advanced scientific and technical 
        degrees from United States institutions of higher education, 
        especially in those scientific and technical areas that are 
        most vital to the national defense (such as those identified by 
        the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering 
        and the Armed Forces).

SEC. 1084. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE MAINTENANCE BY THE UNITED STATES OF A 
              TRIAD OF STRATEGIC NUCLEAR DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) The April 2010 Nuclear Posture Review concluded that 
        even with the reductions specified in the New START Treaty, the 
        United States should retain a nuclear ``Triad'' of land-based 
        intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched 
        ballistic missiles and nuclear capable heavy bombers, noting 
        that ``[r]etaining all three Triad legs will best maintain 
        strategic stability at reasonable cost, while hedging against 
        potential technical problems or vulnerabilities''.
            (2) The resolution of ratification for the New START 
        Treaty, which the Senate approved on December 22, 2010, stated 
        that ``it is the sense of the Senate that United States 
        deterrence and flexibility is assured by a robust triad of 
        strategic delivery vehicles. To this end, the United States is 
        committed to accomplishing the modernization and replacement of 
        its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and to ensuring the 
        continued flexibility of United States conventional and nuclear 
        delivery systems''.
            (3) In a message to the Senate on February 2, 2011, 
        President Obama certified that he intended to ``modernize or 
        replace the triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems: a 
        heavy bomber and air-launched cruise missile, an ICBM, and a 
        nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) and SLBM'' 
        and to ``maintain the United States rocket motor industrial 
        base''.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States should maintain a triad of strategic 
        nuclear delivery systems; and
            (2) the United States is committed to modernizing the 
        component weapons and delivery systems of that triad.

SEC. 1085. PLAN TO PARTNER WITH STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO ADDRESS 
              VETERANS CLAIMS BACKLOG.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs defines any claim 
        for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of 
        Veterans Affairs as backlogged if the claim has been pending 
        for 125 days or more.
            (2) According to the Department, as of November 24, 2012, 
        there were 899,540 pending claims, with 604,583 (67.2 percent) 
        of those considered backlogged.
            (3) The Department's data further shows that, on November 
        22, 2010, there were 749,934 claims pending, with only 244,129 
        (32.6 percent) of those considered backlogged.
            (4) During the past two years, both the overall number of 
        backlogged claims and the percentage of all pending claims that 
        are backlogged have doubled.
            (5) In order to reduce the claims backlog at regional 
        offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs located in Texas, 
        the Texas Veterans Commission announced two initiatives on July 
        19, 2012, to partner with the Department of Veterans Affairs--
                    (A) to assist veterans whose claims are already 
                backlogged to complete development of those claims; and
                    (B) to help veterans who are filing new claims to 
                fully develop those claims prior to filing them, 
                shortening the processing time required.
            (6) The common goal of the two initiatives of the Texas 
        Veterans Commission, called the ``Texas State Strike Force 
        Team'' and the ``Fully Developed Claims Team Initiative'', is 
        to reduce the backlog of claims pending in Texas by 17,000 
        within one year.
            (7) During the first two months of these new initiatives, 
        the Texas Veterans Commission helped veterans complete 
        development of more than 2,500 backlogged claims and assisted 
        veterans with the submission of more than 800 fully developed 
        claims.
            (8) In testimony before the Subcommittee on Disability 
        Assistance and Memorial Affairs of the Committee on Veterans' 
        Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 21, 2012, 
        Diana Rubens, Deputy Under Secretary for Field Operations of 
        the Veterans Benefits Administration, indicated that the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs has experienced positive 
        outcomes in projects with the Texas Veterans Commission, 
        stating that both Veterans Service Organizations ``and state 
        and county service officers . . . are important partners in 
        VBA's transformation to better serve Veterans.''.
            (9) At the same hearing, Mr. John Limpose, director of the 
        regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Waco, 
        Texas, testified that the ``TVC is working very, very well'' 
        with regional offices of the Department in Texas, calling the 
        Texas Veterans Commission a ``very positive story that we can 
        branch out into . . . all of our stakeholders.''.

        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
        shall submit to Congress a plan to reduce the current backlog

                described in subparagraph (B) to eliminate such 
                backlog, including through increasing the percentage of 
                claims that are fully developed prior to submittal to 
                the Secretary and ensuring that new claims are fully 
                developed prior to their submittal.

            (2) placement or emplacement of obstructions near or on 
        Department of Defense airfields, training airspace, or air 
        training routes has the potential of increasing risk to 
        military aircraft and personnel as well as impacting training 
        and readiness; and
            (3) the Department of Defense should develop comprehensive 
        rules and regulations to address construction and use of land 
        in close proximity to Department of Defense airfields, training 
        areas, or air training routes to ensure compatibility with

        mid-summer 2013;
            (2) as part of accomplishing this transition of the lead 
        responsibility for security to the Government of Afghanistan, 
        draw down United States troops to a level sufficient to meet

            (3) as previously announced by the President, continue to 
        draw down United States troop levels at a steady pace through 
        the end of 2014; and
            (4) end all regular combat operations by United States

SEC. 1222. SENSE OF CONGRESS COMMENDING THE ENDURING STRATEGIC 
              PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 
              AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States and Afghanistan have been allies in 
        the conflict against al Qaeda and its affiliates for over a 
        decade, with the shared goal of ensuring that Afghanistan is 
        never again a sanctuary for al Qaeda.
            (2) The United States and Afghanistan are committed to the 
        framework agreed to at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (NATO) Summit in Lisbon in 2010, and reaffirmed at the NATO 
        Summit in Chicago in 2012, for the transition from coalition 
        forces to the Afghan National Security Forces of lead 
        responsibility for security throughout Afghanistan by the end 
        of 2014.
            (3) In June 2011, President Barack Obama said, ``What we 
        can do, and will do, is build a partnership with the Afghan 
        people that endures--one that ensures that we will be able to 
        continue targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan 
        government.''
            (4) In November 2011, a traditional loya jirga in Kabul 
        declared that ``strategic cooperation with the United States of 
        America, which is a strategic ally of the people and government 
        of Afghanistan, is considered important in order to ensure 
        political, economic, and military security'' and also stated, 
        ``Signing a strategic cooperation document with the United 
        States conforms with the national interest of Afghanistan and 
        is of significant importance.''

            (6) At the signing of the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
        Agreement, President Obama said, ``Today we're agreeing to be 
        long-term partners in combating terrorism, and training Afghan 
        security forces, strengthening democratic institutions and 
        supporting development, and protecting human rights of all 
        Afghans. With this agreement, the Afghan people, and the world, 
        should know that Afghanistan has a friend and a partner in the 
        United States.''
            (7) At a May 20, 2012, bilateral meeting with President 
        Karzai at the NATO Summit in Chicago, President Obama said that 
        the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement ``reflects a 
        future in which two sovereign nations--the United States and 
        Afghanistan--are operating as partners, to the benefit of our 
        countries' citizens, but also for the benefit of peace and 
        security and stability in the region and around the world''.
            (8) President Karzai said at the May 20, 2012, bilateral 
        meeting with President Obama, ``Mr. President, the partnership 
        that we signed a few weeks ago in Kabul has turned a new page 
        in our relations. And the new page is a page of two sovereign 
        countries working together for the mutual interests--peace and 
        security and in all other areas.''
            (9) On May 26, 2012, the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of 
        the Afghan parliament, approved the Agreement by a vote of 191-
        7 with 2 abstentions.

        of the Afghan parliament, approved the Agreement by a vote of 
        67-13.
            (11) On July 8, 2012, at the Tokyo Conference on 
        Afghanistan, the international community and the Government of 
        Afghanistan reaffirmed their partnership in the economic growth 
        and development of Afghanistan through a process of mutual 
        commitments and accountability.
            (12) On July 4, 2012, the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
        Agreement entered into force.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the members of the United States Armed Forces, 
        intelligence community, and diplomatic and development 
        community of the United States are to be commended for their 
        dedicated efforts and sacrifices in support of military and 
        stability operations in Afghanistan that have helped strengthen 
        security in Afghanistan, laid the foundation for transition to 
        a long-term partnership between the United States and a 
        sovereign Afghanistan, and supported the Government and people 
        of Afghanistan as they continue to build their capacity to 
        effectively and justly govern;
            (2) the United States negotiating team for the Enduring 
        Strategic Partnership Agreement, including the United States 
        Embassy personnel in Kabul under the leadership of Ambassador 
        Ryan Crocker, is to be commended for its committed diplomatic 
        efforts;
            (3) the Governments of the United States and Afghanistan 
        are to be commended for concluding the Enduring Strategic 
        Partnership Agreement;
            (4) Congress supports the objectives and principles of the 
        Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement, including protecting 
        and promoting shared democratic values, advancing long-term 
        security, reinforcing regional security and cooperation, 
        fostering social and economic development, upholding the rights 
        of women and minorities, and strengthening institutions and 
        governance in Afghanistan;
            (5) it is essential that the Government and people of 
        Afghanistan fulfill Afghanistan's international commitments as 
        agreed at the Tokyo Conference of July 2012, the Bonn 
        Conference of December 2011, the Kabul Conference of July 2011, 
        and other venues to combat corruption, protect the equal rights 
        of all citizens of Afghanistan and enforce the rule of law, 
        hold free and fair elections in 2014, and build inclusive and 
        effective institutions of democratic governance;
            (6) a key national security interest of the United States 
        is to maintain a long-term political, economic, and military 
        relationship with Afghanistan, including a limited presence of 
        United States Armed Forces for the purpose of training, 
        advising, and supporting Afghan National Security Forces and 
        cooperating on shared counterterrorism objectives;
            (7) the negotiation and conclusion of a Bilateral Security 
        Agreement, as called for in the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
        Agreement, will provide a fundamental framework for the long-
        term security relationship between the United States and 
        Afghanistan; and
            (8) Congress has a critical role in continuing to provide 
        the support and assistance necessary to achieve the goals of 
        the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement.

SEC. 1223. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF BILATERAL SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH 
              AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Authorization for the Use of Military Force (Public 
        Law 107-40; 115 Stat. 224) authorizes the President to use all 
        necessary and appropriate force against those nations, 
        organizations, or persons the President determines planned, 
        authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that 
        occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations 
        or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of 
        international terrorism against the United States by such 
        nations, organizations, or persons.
            (2) President Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon 
        Panetta have stated that the United States continues to fight 
        in Afghanistan to defeat the al Qaeda threat and the Taliban, 
        which harbored al Qaeda in Afghanistan, where the attacks of 
        September 11, 2001, were planned and where the attackers 
        received training.
            (3) On May 1, 2012, the United States entered into the 
        ``Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement Between the United 
        States of America and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'', 
        which establishes an enduring strategic partnership between the 
        United States and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
            (4) The Agreement reaffirms the presence and operations of 
        United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan, and establishes 
        long-term commitments between the two countries, including the 
        continued commitment of United States forces and political and 
        financial support to the Government of Afghanistan.
            (5) The Agreement also commits the United States to 
        establishing a long-term Bilateral Security Agreement, with the 
        goal of concluding a Bilateral Security Agreement within one 
        year to supersede the present Status of Forces agreements with 
        the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
            (6) Congress was not consulted regarding the framework or 
        substance of the Agreement.
            (7) In the past, Congress has been consulted, and, in some 
        cases, has provided its advice and consent to ratification of 
        such agreements, including those where the use of force was not 
        authorized nor required in the country.
    (b) Notification Requirement.--Not later than 30 days before 
entering into any Bilateral Security Agreement or other agreement with 
the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan that will affect the Status of 
Forces agreements and long-term commitments between the United States 
and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the President shall submit the 
agreement to the appropriate congressional committees for review. If 
the President fails to comply with such requirement, 50 percent of the 
unobligated balance of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made 
available for the Executive Office of the President shall be withheld.
    (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 1249. PLAN FOR PROMOTING THE SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN AND GIRLS 
              DURING THE SECURITY TRANSITION PROCESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Department of Defense's April 2012 
        Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in 
        Afghanistan:
                    (A) ``U.S. and coalition forces will continue to 
                degrade the Taliban-led insurgency in order to provide 
                time and space to increase the capacity of the Afghan 
                National Security Forces and the Afghan Government so 
                they can assume full responsibility for Afghanistan's 
                security by the end of 2014.''
                    (B) ``Transition to Afghan security lead began in 
                July 2011 and transition to full Afghan security 
                responsibility will be complete country-wide by the end 
                of 2014.''
                    (C) ``The security of the Afghan people and the 
                stability of the government are used to judge 
                provincial readiness to move to each successive stage 
                of transition implementation.''
                    (D) For each area designated for transition, a 
                transition implementation plan is developed by the 
                Government of Afghanistan, NATO, and ISAF and approved 
                by the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB). JANIB 
                is also responsible for recommending areas to enter and 
                exit the transition process.
            (2) According to a 2002 study on Women, Peace and Security 
        submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
        pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), ``the 
        suspension of or restriction on women's enjoyment of their 
        human rights'' can act as an early-warning indicator of 
        impending or renewed conflict. In Afghanistan, restrictions on 
        women's mobility and rights can signal the presence of 
        extremist or insurgent elements in a community.
            (3) The security of Afghan women and girls in areas 
        undergoing security transitions will be an important gauge of 
        the transition strategy's success. Indicators by which to 
        measure women's security include the mobility of women and 
        girls, the participation of women in local government bodies, 
        the rate of school attendance for girls, women's access to 
        government services, and the prevalence of violence against 
        women.
            (4) Maintaining and improving physical security for Afghan 
        women and girls throughout the country is critical in order for 
        women and girls to take advantage of opportunities in 
        education, commerce, politics, and other areas of public life, 
        which in turn is essential for the future stability and 
        prosperity of Afghanistan.
            (5) Women who serve as public officials at all levels of 
        the Government of Afghanistan face serious threats to their 
        personal security and that of their families. Many female 
        officials have been the victims of violent crimes, but they are 
        generally not afforded official protection by the Government of 
        Afghanistan or security forces.
            (6) Protecting the security and human rights of Afghan 
        women and girls requires the involvement of Afghan men and boys 
        through education about the important benefits of women's full 
        participation in social, economic, and political life. Male 
        officials and security personnel can play a particularly 
        important role in supporting and protecting women and girls.
            (7) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May 
        2012 states: ``As the Afghan National Police further develop 
        and professionalize, they will evolve towards a sustainable, 
        credible, and accountable civilian law enforcement force that 
        will shoulder the main responsibility for domestic security. 
        This force should be capable of providing policing services to 
        the Afghan population as part of the broader Afghan rule of law 
        system.''
            (8) Women face significant barriers to full participation 
        in the ANA and ANP, including a discriminatory or hostile work 
        environment and the lack of separate facilities designed for 
        female personnel.
            (9) As of September 2012, female recruitment and retention 
        rates for the Afghan National Security Forces are far below 
        published targets, as follows:
                    (A) Approximately 1,700 women serve in the Afghan 
                National Security Forces, or less than half of one 
                percent of the total force.
                    (B) In 2010, President Hamid Karzai announced plans 
                to recruit and train 5,000 women in the Afghan National 
                Police, or approximately 3 percent of the force, by 
                2014. Currently, there are approximately 1,370 women in 
                the ANP, or 0.87 percent of the police force.
                    (C) Approximately 350 women currently serve in the 
                Afghan National Army, representing only 0.17 percent of 
                the force. The Government of Afghanistan has said that 
                its goal is to achieve a force that is 10 percent 
                female. As of May 2012, approximately 3 percent of new 
                ANA recruits were women.
            (10) Male security personnel often do not respond to 
        threats or incidences of violence against women, particularly 
        at the local level. They largely lack the training and 
        understanding needed to respond appropriately and effectively 
        to situations involving women. According to the Department of 
        Defense's April 2012 Report on Progress Toward Security and 
        Stability in Afghanistan:
                    (A) The Afghan Ministry of Defense ``lacks the 
                combination of policies, procedures, and execution to 
                promote opportunity and fair and respectful treatment 
                of women in the force''.
                    (B) The Afghan Ministry of Interior ``faces 
                significant challenges in fully integrating and 
                protecting women in the ANP workforce, especially among 
                operational units at the provincial and district 
                levels''.
                    (C) In the Afghan National Police, ``Many 
                Provincial Headquarters Commanders do not accept 
                policewomen, as they prefer male candidates and lack 
                adequate facilities to support females.''
                    (D) ``While women are greatly needed to support 
                police operations, a combination of cultural 
                impediments, weak recruitment, and uneven application 
                of policies hinder significant progress.''
                    (E) ``Although stronger documentation, 
                implementation, and enforcement of policies, 
                procedures, and guidance to better integrate women will 
                help, time will be needed to change the cultural mores 
                that form the basis of many of the current 
                impediments.''
            (11) The United States, the North American Treaty 
        Organization, and United States coalition partners have made 
        firm commitments to support the human rights of the women and 
        girls of Afghanistan, as evidenced by the following actions:
                    (A) According to the United States National Action 
                Plan on Women, Peace and Security, ``integrating women 
                and gender considerations into peace-building processes 
                helps promote democratic governance and long-term 
                stability,'' which are key United States strategic 
                goals in Afghanistan.
                    (B) The National Action Plan also states that ``the 
                engagement and protection of women as agents of peace 
                and stability will be central to United States efforts 
                to promote security, prevent, respond to, and resolve 
                conflict, and rebuild societies.'' This policy applies 
                to United States Government efforts in Afghanistan, 
                where addressing the security vulnerabilities of Afghan 
                women and girls during the period of security 
                transition is an essential step toward long-term 
                stability.
                    (C) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO 
                in May 2012 states: ``We emphasize the importance of 
                full participation of all Afghan women in the 
                reconstruction, political, peace and reconciliation 
                processes in Afghanistan and the need to respect the 
                institutional arrangements protecting their rights. We 
                remain committed to the implementation of United 
                Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on 
                women, peace and security. We recognize also the need 
                for the protection of children from the damaging 
                effects of armed conflict as required in relevant 
                UNSCRs.''
            (12) The Strategic Partnership Agreement signed between the 
        United States and Afghanistan by President Obama and President 
        Karzai in June 2012 states, ``Consistent with its Constitution 
        and international obligations, Afghanistan shall ensure and 
        advance the essential role of women in society, so that they 
        may fully enjoy their economic, social, political, civil and 
        cultural rights.''
    (b) Plan To Promote Security of Afghan Women.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in 
        concurrence with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a plan to promote the 
        security of Afghan women during the security transition 
        process.
            (2) Elements.--The plan required under paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following elements:
                    (A) A plan to monitor and respond to changes in 
                women's security conditions in areas undergoing 
                transition, including the following actions:
                            (i) Seeking to designate a Civilian Impact 
                        Advisor on the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board 
                        (JANIB) to assess the impact of transition on 
                        male and female civilians and ensure that 
                        efforts to protect women's rights and security 
                        are included in each area's transition 
                        implementation plan.
                            (ii) Reviewing existing indicators against 
                        which sex-disaggregated data is collected and, 
                        if necessary, developing additional indicators, 
                        to ensure the availability of data that can be 
                        used to measure women's security, such as--
                                    (I) the mobility of women and 
                                girls;
                                    (II) the participation of women in 
                                local government bodies;
                                    (III) the rate of school attendance 
                                for girls;
                                    (IV) women's access to government 
                                services; and
                                    (V) the prevalence of violence 
                                against women; and incorporating those 
                                indicators into ongoing efforts to 
                                assess overall security conditions 
                                during the transition period.
                            (iii) Integrating assessments of women's 
                        security into current procedures used to 
                        determine an area's readiness to proceed 
                        through the transition process.
                            (iv) Working with Afghan partners, 
                        coalition partners, and relevant United States 
                        Government departments and agencies to take 
                        concrete action to support women's rights and 
                        security in cases of deterioration in women's 
                        security conditions during the transition 
                        period.
                    (B) A plan to increase gender awareness and 
                responsiveness among Afghan National Army and Afghan 
                National Police personnel, including the following 
                actions:
                            (i) Working with Afghan and coalition 
                        partners to utilize training curricula and 
                        programming that addresses the human rights of 
                        women and girls, appropriate responses to 
                        threats against women and girls, and 
                        appropriate behavior toward female colleagues 
                        and members of the community; assessing the 
                        quality and consistency of this training across 
                        regional commands; and assessing the impact of 
                        this training on trainee behavior.
                            (ii) Working with national and local ANA 
                        and ANP leaders to develop and utilize 
                        enforcement and accountability mechanisms for 
                        ANA and ANP personnel who violate codes of 
                        conduct related to the human rights of women 
                        and girls.
                            (iii) Working with Afghan and coalition 
                        partners to implement the above tools and 
                        develop uniform methods and standards for 
                        training and enforcement among coalition 
                        partners and across regions.
                    (C) A plan to increase the number of female members 
                of the ANA and ANP, including the following actions:
                            (i) Providing, through consultation with 
                        Afghan partners, realistic and achievable 
                        objectives for the recruitment and retention of 
                        women to the ANA and ANP by the end of the 
                        security transition period in 2014.
                            (ii) Working with national and local ANA 
                        and ANP leaders and coalition partners to 
                        address physical and cultural challenges to the 
                        recruitment and retention of female ANA and ANP 
                        personnel, including through targeted 
                        recruitment campaigns, expanded training and 
                        mentorship opportunities, parity in pay and 
                        promotion rates with male counterparts, and 
                        availability of facilities for female 
                        personnel.
                            (iii) Working with national and local ANA 
                        and ANP leaders to increase understanding about 
                        the unique ways in which women members of the 
                        security forces improve the force's overall 
                        effectiveness.
                            (iv) Working with national and local ANA 
                        and ANP leaders to develop a plan for 
                        maintaining and increasing the recruitment and 
                        retention of women in the ANA and ANP following 
                        the completion of the security transition.
            (3) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall include in each 
        report on progress toward security and stability in Afghanistan 
        that is submitted to Congress under sections 1230 and 1231 of 
        the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 
        (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 385, 390) a section describing 
        actions taken to implement the plan required under this 
        subsection.
    (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 1250. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ISRAELI IRON DOME DEFENSIVE WEAPON 
              SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The citizens of Israel have suffered under a continual 
        barrage of missiles, rockets, and mortar shells from the Hamas-
        controlled Gaza Strip.
            (2) Hamas has been designated by the Secretary of State as 
        a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
            (3) Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza have routinely 
        used human shields and launched rockets from civilian areas.
            (4) Israel has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid 
        Palestinian civilian casualties, including aborting attacks on 
        military targets because of the presence of civilians, alerting 
        civilians to leave areas of potential conflict, and allowing 
        the importation of medical and other supplies into Gaza.
            (5) Israel faces additional rocket and missile threats from 
        Lebanon and Syria.
            (6) The Government of Iran has supplied Hamas with advanced 
        longer range missiles such as the Fajar-5.
            (7) Hamas has deployed these weapons to be fired from 
        within their own civilian population.
            (8) The Government of Israel, taking seriously the threat 
        of short range rockets and mortars, designed, developed, and 
        produced the Iron Dome system to address those threats.
            (9) The Iron Dome system has successfully intercepted 
        hundreds of rockets targeting population centers in Israel.
            (10) The Iron Dome system has maintained a success rate of 
        close to 90 percent.
            (11) The Government of Israel currently maintains 5 Iron 
        Dome batteries, a number insufficient to protect all of Israel.
            (12) It appears that approximately 10 additional Iron Dome 
        batteries are needed to protect all of Israel.
            (13) The United States Government, recognizing the threat 
        to Israeli citizens and desirous of promoting peace, approved 
        funding to assist the Government of Israel in procuring Iron 
        Dome batteries.
            (14) Israel maintains a significant inventory of Iron Dome 
        interceptors which has been reduced due to attacks from Gaza.
            (15) Israel used a significant number of precision-guided 
        munitions in order to destroy military targets while minimizing 
        civilian casualties in its recent defensive effort in Gaza.
            (16) President Barack Obama has expressed his intention to 
        seek additional funding for Iron Dome and other United States-
        Israel missile defense systems.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) reaffirms its commitment to the security of our ally 
        and strategic partner, Israel;
            (2) fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against 
        acts of terrorism;
            (3) sympathizes with the families of Israelis who have come 
        under the indiscriminate rocket fire from Hamas-controlled 
        Gaza;
            (4) recognizes the exceptional success of the Iron Dome 
        Missile Defense system in defending the population of Israel;
            (5) desires to help ensure that Israel has the means to 
        defend itself against terrorist attacks, including through the 
        acquisition of additional Iron Dome batteries and interceptors; 
        and
            (6) urges the Departments of Defense and State to explore 
        with their Israeli counterparts and alert Congress of any needs 
        the Israeli Defense Force may have for additional Iron Dome 
        batteries, interceptors, or other equipment depleted during the 
        current conflict.

SEC. 1251. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE SITUATION IN THE SENKAKU ISLANDS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the East China Sea is a vital part of the maritime 
        commons of Asia, including critical sea lanes of communication 
        and commerce that benefit all nations of the Asia-Pacific 
        region;
            (2) the peaceful settlement of territorial and 
        jurisdictional disputes in the East China Sea requires the 
        exercise of self-restraint by all parties in the conduct of 
        activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and 
        destabilize the region, and differences should be handled in a 
        constructive manner consistent with universally recognized 
        principles of customary international law;
            (3) while the United States takes no position on the 
        ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku islands, the United States 
        acknowledges the administration of Japan over the Senkaku 
        Islands;
            (4) The unilateral action of a third party will not affect 
        the United States' acknowledgment of the administration of 
        Japan over the Senkaku Islands;
            (5) the United States has national interests in freedom of 
        navigation, the maintenance of peace and stability, respect for 
        international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce;
            (6) the United States supports a collaborative diplomatic 
        process by claimants to resolve territorial disputes without 
        coercion, and opposes efforts at coercion, the threat of use of 
        force, or use of force by any claimant in seeking to resolve 
        sovereignty and territorial issues in the East China Sea; and
            (7) the United States reaffirms its commitment to the 
        Government of Japan under Article V of the Treaty of Mutual

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Iran's energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors and 
        Iran's ports are facilitating the Government of Iran's nuclear 
        proliferation activities by providing revenue to support 
        proliferation activities.
            (2) The United Nations Security Council and the United 
        States Government have expressed concern about the 
        proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear program.

        Agency (in this section referred to as the ``IAEA'') has in

        possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program.
            (4) The Government of Iran continues to defy the 
        requirements and obligations contained in relevant IAEA Board

        derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's

            (6) The National Iranian Tanker Company is the main carrier 
        for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-designated National 
        Iranian Oil Company and a key element in the petroleum supply

            (1) Rulemaking.--The provisions of this subsection are 
        enacted by Congress--

                Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, 
                and as such they shall be considered as part of the 
                rules of each House, respectively, or of that House to 
                which they specifically apply, and such rules supersede 
                other rules only to the extent that they are

                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change such rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, 
                in the same manner and to the same extent as in the 
                case of any other rule of that House.
            (2) Military compensation and retirement modernization 
        bill.--For the purpose of this subsection, the term ``military 
        compensation and retirement modernization bill'' means only a 
        bill consisting of the proposed legislative language 
        recommended by the Commission and submitted to Congress by the 
        President pursuant to subsection (a).
            (3) Introduction of legislative proposal in house and 
        senate.--If the President transmits to Congress under 
        subsection (a) a copy of the recommendations of the Commission 
        (including the legislative language recommended by the 
        Commission), together with a certification of the approval of 
        the President of the recommendations, the proposed legislative 
        language recommended by the Commission and submitted to 
        Congress by the President pursuant to that subsection--
                    (A) shall be introduced in the Senate (by request) 
                on the next day on which the Senate is in session by 
                the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the 
                Senate; and
                    (B) shall be introduced in the House of 
                Representatives (by request) on the next legislative 
                day by the chair of the Committee on Armed Services of 
                the House of Representatives.
            (4) Consideration in the house of representatives.--
                    (A) Referral and reporting.--Any committee of the 
                House of Representatives to which the military 
                compensation and retirement modernization bill is 
                referred shall report it to the House without amendment 
                not later than the end of the 60-day period beginning 
                on the date on which the bill is introduced. If a 
                committee fails to report the bill to the House within 
                that period, it shall be in order to move that the 
                House discharge the committee from further 
                consideration of the bill. Such a motion shall not be 
                in order after the last committee authorized to 
                consider the bill reports it to the House or after the 
                House has disposed of a motion to discharge the bill. 
                The previous question shall be considered as ordered on 
                the motion to its adoption without intervening motion 
                except 20 minutes of debate equally divided and 
                controlled by the proponent and an opponent. If such a 
                motion is adopted, the House shall proceed immediately 
                to consider the Commission bill in accordance with 
                subparagraphs (B) and (C). A motion to reconsider the 
                vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in 
                order.
                    (B) Proceeding to consideration.--After the last 
                committee authorized to consider a military 
                compensation and retirement modernization bill reports 
                it to the House or has been discharged (other than by 
                motion) from its consideration, it shall be in order to 
                move to proceed to consider the military compensation 
                and retirement modernization bill in the House. Such a 
                motion shall not be in order after the House has 
                disposed of a motion to proceed with respect to the 
                military compensation and retirement modernization 
                bill. The previous question shall be considered as 
                ordered on the motion to its adoption without 
                intervening motion. A motion to reconsider the vote by 
                which the motion is disposed of shall not be in order.
                    (C) Consideration.--The military compensation and 
                retirement modernization bill shall be considered as 
                read. All points of order against the bill and against 
                its consideration are waived. The previous question 
                shall be considered as ordered on the bill to its 
                passage without intervening motion except 2 hours of 
                debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent 
                and an opponent and one motion to limit debate on the 
                bill. A motion to reconsider the vote on passage of the 
                bill shall not be in order.
                    (D) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage of the 
                military compensation and retirement modernization bill 
                shall occur not later than the end of the 90-day period 
                beginning on the date on which the bill is introduced.
            (5) Expedited procedure in the senate.--
                    (A) Committee consideration.--A military 
                compensation and retirement modernization bill 
                introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) shall be 
                jointly referred to the committee or committees of 
                jurisdiction, which committees shall report the bill 
                without any revision and with a favorable 
                recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or 
                without recommendation, not later than the end of the 
                60-day period beginning on the date on which the bill 
                is introduced. If any committee fails to report the 
                bill within that period, that committee shall be 
                automatically discharged from consideration of the 
                bill, and the bill shall be placed on the appropriate 
                calendar.
                    (B) Motion to proceed.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII 
                of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order, 
                not later than 2 days of session after the date on 
                which a military compensation and retirement 
                modernization bill is reported or discharged from all 
                committees to which it was referred, for the majority 
                leader of the Senate or the majority leader's designee 
                to move to proceed to the consideration of the military 
                compensation and retirement modernization bill. It 
                shall also be in order for any Member of the Senate to 
                move to proceed to the consideration of the military 
                compensation and retirement modernization bill at any 
                time after the conclusion of such 2-day period. A 
                motion to proceed is in order even though a previous 
                motion to the same effect has been disagreed to. All 
                points of order against the motion to proceed to the 
                military compensation and retirement modernization bill 
                are waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. The 
                motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. A motion 
                to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to 
                or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of the military 
                compensation and retirement modernization bill is 
                agreed to, the military compensation and retirement 
                modernization bill shall remain the unfinished business 
                until disposed of.
                    (C) Consideration.--All points of order, other than 
                budget points of order, against the military 
                compensation and retirement modernization bill and 
                against consideration of the bill are waived. 
                Consideration of the bill and of all debatable motions 
                and appeals in connection therewith shall not exceed a 
                total of 10 hours which shall be divided equally 
                between the majority and minority leaders or their 
                designees. A motion further to limit debate on the bill 
                is in order, shall require an affirmative vote of 
                three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn, and 
                is not debatable. Any debatable motion or appeal is 
                debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided 
                equally between those favoring and those opposing the 
                motion or appeal. All time used for consideration of 
                the bill, including time used for quorum calls and

        related hazards; and

SEC. 3133. REGIONAL RADIOLOGICAL SECURITY ZONES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A terrorist attack using high-activity radiological 
        materials, such as in a dirty bomb, could inflict billions of 
        dollars of economic costs and considerable societal and 
        economic dislocation, with effects and costs possibly lasting 
        for years.
            (2) It may be easier for terrorists to obtain the materials 
        for, and to fabricate, a dirty bomb than an improvised nuclear 
        device.
            (3) Radiological materials are in widespread use worldwide, 
        with estimates of the number of radiological sources ranging 
        from 100,000 to millions.
            (4) Many nations have a security and regulatory regime for 
        their radiological sources that is much less developed than 
        that of the United States.
            (5) Radiological materials are used at many civilian sites 
        including hospitals, industrial sites, and other locations that 
        have little security, placing these materials at risk of theft.
            (6) Many radiological materials have become lost, disused, 
        unwanted, or abandoned, with the Global Threat Reduction 
        Initiative of the National Nuclear Security Administration 
        having recovered more than 30,000 radioactive sources in the 
        United States, repatriated more than 2,400 United States-origin 
        sources from other countries, and helped recover more than 
        13,000 radioactive sources and radioisotope thermoelectric 
        generators in other countries.
            (7) High-activity radiological materials can be used in a 
        dirty bomb.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that United 
States and global nonproliferation efforts should place a high priority 
on programs to secure high-activity radiological sources to reduce the 
threat of radiological terrorism.
    (c) Study.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the National 
        Nuclear Security Administration shall submit to the appropriate 
        committees of Congress a study in accordance with paragraph 
        (3).
            (2) Consultation.--The Administrator may, in conducting the 
        study required under paragraph (1), consult with the Secretary 
        of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, the Nuclear 
        Regulatory Commission, and such other departments and agencies 
        of the United States Government as the Administrator considers 
        appropriate.
            (3) Matters included.--The study under paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) An assessment of the radioactive isotopes and 
                associated activity levels that present the greatest 
                risk to national and international security.
                    (B) A review of current United States Government 
                efforts to secure radiological materials abroad,

                       Subtitle D--Other Matters

SEC. 3141. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE NUCLEAR SECURITY 
              ENTERPRISE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration 
        was established as an independent entity within the Department 
        of Energy to manage and secure the nuclear weapons stockpile of 
        the United States and to manage nuclear nonproliferation and 
        naval reactor programs.
            (2) Serious security and health incidents continue to occur 
        at sites of the National Nuclear Security Administration.
            (3) In September 2012, an official of the Government 
        Accountability Office testified to Congress that lax laboratory 
        attitudes toward safety procedures, laboratory inadequacies in 
        identifying and addressing safety problems with appropriate 
        corrective actions, and inadequate oversight by site offices of 
        the National Nuclear Security Administration were responsible 
        for nearly 100 safety incidents since 2000.
            (4) On July 28, 2012, three unarmed individuals compromised 
        security at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, 
        Tennessee, and according to the Government Accountability 
        Office, ``gained access to the protected security area directly 
        adjacent to one of the nation's most critically important 
        nuclear weapons-related facilities''.
            (5) In June 2006, hackers attacked an unclassified computer 
        system at the National Nuclear Security Administration's 
        Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and gained access to 
        a file containing the names and social security numbers of more 
        than 1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security 
        Administration.
            (6) As early as February 2005, the Inspector General of the 
        Department of Energy identified problems with the retrieval of 
        badges from terminated employees at Los Alamos National 
        Laboratory and other sites of the National Nuclear Security 
        Administration.
            (7) In 2004, a pattern of safety and security incidents 
        that occurred over the course of a year prompted the stand-down 
        of Los Alamos National Laboratory.
            (8) The National Nuclear Security Administration, 
        independent of the safety and security reform efforts of the 
        Department of Energy, has launched an overhaul of its 
        contracting oversight, placing an emphasis on contractor self-
        policing through an untested ``contractor assurance'' approach.
            (9) The Government Accountability Office has given the 
        contractor administration and project management capabilities 
        of the National Nuclear Security Administration a ``high risk'' 
        designation and found there to be insufficient qualified 
        Federal acquisition professionals to ``plan, direct, and 
        oversee project execution''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) there is a need for strong, independent oversight of 
        the United States nuclear security enterprise;
            (2) any attempt to reform oversight of the nuclear security 
        enterprise that transfers oversight from the Department of 
        Energy to the National Nuclear Security Administration, reduces 
        protections for worker health and safety at facilities of the 
        National Nuclear Security Administration to levels below the 
        standards of the Department of Energy, or transfers 
        construction appropriations for the nuclear security enterprise 
        from the Department of Energy appropriation account to the 
        military construction appropriation account, should be 
        carefully evaluated;
            (3) the Office of Health, Safety, and Security of the 
        Department of Energy, which reports to the Secretary of Energy 
        but is also accountable for routinely reporting to Congress on 
        the performance with respect to safety and security of the 
        Department, including the National Nuclear Security 
        Administration, and the role of that Office in overseeing 
        safety and security at the National Nuclear Security 
        Administration, should not be diminished but should be 
        routinely evaluated;
            (4) any future modifications to the management or structure 
        of the nuclear security enterprise should be done in a way that 
        maintains or increases oversight of critical construction, 
        security, and acquisition capabilities;
            (5) to the extent possible, oversight of programs of the 
        National Nuclear Security Administration by the Department of 
        Defense should increase to ensure current and future 
        warfighting requirements are met; and
            (6) the Nuclear Weapons Council should provide proper 
        oversight in the execution of its responsibilities under 
        section 179 of title 10, United States Code.

                    (B) the reactor operator has provided assurances 
                that, whenever an alternative nuclear reactor fuel, 
                enriched in the isotope U-235 to less than 20 percent, 
                can be used in that reactor, it will use that 
                alternative in lieu of highly enriched uranium; and
                    (C) the reactor operator has provided a current 
                report on the status of its efforts to convert the 
                reactor to an alternative nuclear reactor fuel enriched 
                in the isotope U-235 to less than 20 percent, and an 
                anticipated schedule for completion of conversion.
            (4) Public participation and review.--The Secretary shall--
                    (A) develop a program plan and annually update the

                      DIVISION F--STOLEN VALOR ACT

                       TITLE LI--STOLEN VALOR ACT

SEC. 5011. SHORT TITLE.

    This division may be cited as the ``Stolen Valor Act of 2012''.

SEC. 5012. FINDINGS.

    Congress find the following:
            (1) Because of the great respect in which military service 
        and military awards are rightfully held by the public, false 
        claims of receiving such medals or serving in the military are 
        especially likely to be harmful and material to employers, 
        voters in deciding to whom paid elective positions should be 
        entrusted, and in the award of contracts.
            (2) Military service and military awards are held in such 
        great respect that public and private decisions are correctly 
        influenced by claims of heroism.
            (3) False claims of military service or military heroism 
        are an especially noxious means of obtaining something of value 
        because they are particularly likely to cause tangible harm to 
        victims of fraud.
            (4) False claims of military service or the receipt of 
        military awards, if believed, are especially likely to dispose 
        people favorably toward the speaker.
            (5) False claims of military service or the receipt of 
        military awards are particularly likely to be material and 
        cause people to part with money or property. Even if such 
        claims are unsuccessful in bringing about this result, they 
        still constitute attempted fraud.
            (6) False claims of military service or the receipt of 
        military awards that are made to secure appointment to the 
        board of an organization are likely to cause harm to such 
        organization through their obtaining the services of an 
        individual who does not bring to that organization what he or 
        she claims, and whose falsehood, if discovered, would cause the 
        organization's donors concern that the organization's board 
        might not manage money honestly.
            (7) The easily verifiable nature of false claims regarding 
        military service or the receipt of military awards, the 
        relative infrequency of such claims, and the fact that false 
        claims of having served in the military or received such awards 
        are rightfully condemned across the political spectrum, it is 
        especially likely that any law prohibiting such false claims 
        would not be enforced selectively.
            (8) Congress may make criminal the false claim of military 
        service or the receipt of military awards based on its powers 
        under article I, section 8, clause 2 of the Constitution of the 
        United States, to raise and support armies, and article I, 
        section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution of the United States, 
        to enact necessary and proper measures to carry into execution 
        that power.

            Subtitle C--Sense of Congress Regarding Spectrum

SEC. 5317. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SPECTRUM.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Nation's mobile communications industry is a 
        significant economic engine, by one estimate directly or 
        indirectly supporting 3,800,000 jobs, or 2.6 percent of all 
        United States employment, contributing $195,500,000,000 to the 
        United States gross domestic product and driving 
        $33,000,000,000 in productivity improvements in 2011;
            (2) while wireless carriers are continually implementing 
        new and more efficient technologies and techniques to maximize 
        their existing spectrum capacity, there is a pressing need for 
        additional spectrum for mobile broadband services, with one 
        report predicting that global mobile data traffic will increase 
        18-fold between 2011 and 2016 at a compound annual growth rate 
        of 78 percent, reaching 10.8 exabytes per month by 2016;
            (3) as the Nation faces the growing demand for spectrum, 
        consideration should be given to both the supply of spectrum 
        for licensed networks and for unlicensed devices;
            (4) while this additional demand can be met in part by 
        reallocating spectrum from existing non-governmental uses, the 
        long-term solution must include reallocation and sharing of 
        Federal Government spectrum for private sector use;
            (5) recognizing the important uses of spectrum by the 
        Federal Government, including for national and homeland 
        security, law enforcement and other critical federal uses, 
        existing law ensures that Federal operations are not harmed as 
        a result of a reallocation of spectrum for commercial use, 
        including through the establishment of the Spectrum Relocation 
        Fund to reimburse Federal users for the costs of planning and 
        implementing relocation and sharing arrangements and, with 
        respect to spectrum vacated by the Department of Defense, 
        certification under section 1062 of P.L. 106-65 by the 
        Secretaries of Defense and Commerce and the Chairman of the 
        Joint Chiefs of Staff that replacement spectrum provides 
        comparable technical characteristics to restore essential 
        military capability; and
            (6) given the need to determine equitable outcomes for the 
        Nation in relation to spectrum use that balance the private 
        sector's demand for spectrum with national security and other 
        critical federal missions, all interested parties should be 
        encouraged to continue the collaborative efforts between 
        industry and government stakeholders that have been launched by 
        the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
        to assess and recommend practical frameworks for the 
        development of relocation, transition, and sharing arrangement 
        and plans for 110 megahertz of federal spectrum in the 1695-
        1710 MHz and the 1755-1850 MHz bands.

            Passed the Senate December 4, 2012.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
