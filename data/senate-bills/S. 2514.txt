            (2) The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program of the 
        Department of Defense is a critical element of the Department's 
        plans for assuring United States access to space.
            (3) Significant contractions in the commercial space launch 
        marketplace have eroded the overall viability of the United 
        States space launch industrial base and could hamper the 
        ability of the Department of Defense to provide assured access 
        to space in the future.
            (4) The continuing viability of the United States space 
        launch industrial base is a critical element of any strategy to 
        ensure the long-term ability of the United States to assure 
        access to space.
            (5) The Under Secretary of the Air Force, as acquisition 
        executive for space programs in the Department of Defense, has 
        been authorized to develop a strategy to address United States 
        space launch and assured access to space requirements.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Under 
Secretary of the Air Force should--
            (1) evaluate all options for sustaining the United States 
        space launch industrial base;
            (2) develop an integrated, long-range, and adequately 
        funded plan for assuring United States access to space; and

        the budget for the fiscal year covered by the defense budget 
        materials and the future-years defense program submitted to 
        Congress in relation to such budget under section 221 of this 
        title provide for funding ship construction for the Navy at a 
        level that is sufficient for the procurement of the ships 
        provided for in the plan on schedule.
            ``(4) If the budget for the fiscal year provides for 
        funding ship construction at a level that is not sufficient for 
        the recapitalization of the force of Navy ships at the annual 
        rate necessary to sustain the force, an assessment (coordinated 
        with the commanders of the combatant commands in advance) that

        force structure that will result from funding ship construction 
        at such insufficient level.

        operations, rotational deployments, and in the war on 
        terrorism.

        religious diversity and represent unparalleled levels of 
        freedom of conscience, speech, and worship that set the United

            (6) Religious organizations have richly blessed the

                proliferation threats in the states of the former 
                Soviet Union that jeopardize United States national 
                security.
            (2) Cooperative Threat Reduction funds, for a fiscal year, 
        are the funds authorized to be appropriated for Cooperative

        opportunities to achieve long-standing United States 
        nonproliferation goals.
    (2) The amount that may be obligated under paragraph (1) in any 
fiscal year for projects and activities described in that paragraph may

    (f) Exception.--(1) The Secretary may obligate and expend

subsection (b) without regard to subsection (e) if the Secretary

project or activity under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to 
the congressional defense committees a report containing a detailed 
justification for the obligation of funds. The report on a project or

            (A) A description of the critical emerging proliferation

        nonproliferation goal to be achieved, by the project or 
        activity.
            (B) A description of the agreement, if any, under which the

        threat reduction assistance, including whether or not the need

        cooperative threat reduction program or programs to account for 
        such assistance.
            (F) A description of the mechanisms to be used by the 
        Secretary to assure that proper audits and examinations of the 
        project or activity are carried out.

U.S.C. 5852) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``Funds'' and inserting ``(a) 
        Eligibility.--Except as provided in subsection (b), funds''; 
        and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(b) Waiver of Eligibility Requirements.--(1) Funds may be 
obligated for a fiscal year under subsection (a) for assistance or 
other programs and activities for an independent state of the former 
Soviet Union that does not meet one or more of the requirements for

SEC. 1205. RUSSIAN TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, in addition 
        to rogue states, are known to be working to acquire weapons of 
        mass destruction, and particularly nuclear warheads.
            (2) The largest and least secure potential source of 
        nuclear warheads for terrorists or rogue states is Russia's 
        arsenal of nonstrategic or ``tactical'' nuclear warheads, which 
        according to unclassified estimates numbers from 7,000 to 
        12,000 warheads. Security at Russian nuclear weapon storage 
        sites is insufficient, and tactical nuclear warheads are more 
        vulnerable to terrorist or rogue state acquisition due to their 
        smaller size, greater portability, and greater numbers compared 
        to Russian strategic nuclear weapons.
            (3) Russia's tactical nuclear warheads were not covered by 
        the START treaties or the recent Moscow Treaty. Russia is not 
        legally bound to reduce its tactical nuclear stockpile and the 
        United States has no inspection rights regarding Russia's 
        tactical nuclear arsenal.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--(1) One of the most likely nuclear weapon 
attack scenarios against the United States would involve detonation of 
a stolen Russian tactical nuclear warhead smuggled into the country.
    (2) It is a top national security priority of the United States to 
accelerate efforts to account for, secure, and reduce Russia's 
stockpile of tactical nuclear warheads and associated fissile material.
    (3) This imminent threat warrants a special nonproliferation 
initiative.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, 
the President shall report to Congress on efforts to reduce the 
particular threats associated with Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal 
and the outlines of a special initiative related to reducing the threat 
from Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile.

Subtitle F--Disposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium at Savannah River, 
                             South Carolina

SEC. 3181. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In September 2000, the United States and the Russian 
        Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition 
        Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of 
        weapons-grade plutonium.
            (2) The agreement with Russia is a significant step toward 
        safeguarding nuclear materials and preventing their diversion 
        to rogue states and terrorists.
            (3) The Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34 metric 
        tons of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States before the 
        end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a mixed-oxide fuel 
        to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.
            (4) The Department has formulated a plan for implementing 
        the agreement with Russia through construction of a mixed-oxide 
        fuel fabrication facility, the so-called MOX facility, and a 
        pit disassembly and conversion facility at the Savannah River 
        Site, Aiken, South Carolina.
            (5) The United States and the State of South Carolina have 
        a compelling interest in the safe, proper, and efficient 
        operation of the plutonium disposition facilities at the 
        Savannah River Site. The MOX facility will also be economically 
        beneficial to the State of South Carolina, and that economic 
        benefit will not be fully realized unless the MOX facility is 
        built.
            (6) The State of South Carolina desires to ensure that all 
        plutonium transferred to the State of South Carolina is stored 
        safely; that the full benefits of the MOX facility are realized 
        as soon as possible; and, specifically, that all defense 
        plutonium or defense plutonium materials transferred to the 
        Savannah River Site either be processed or be removed 
        expeditiously.

SEC. 3182. DISPOSITION OF WEAPONS-USABLE PLUTONIUM AT SAVANNAH RIVER 
              SITE.

    (a) Plan for Construction and Operation of MOX Facility.--(1) Not

        oxide fuel by December 31, 2009; and
            (B) a schedule of operations of the MOX facility designed 
        so that 34 metric tons of defense plutonium and defense 
        plutonium materials at the Savannah River Site will be 
        processed into mixed oxide fuel by January 1, 2019.
    (3)(A) Not later than February 15 each year, beginning in 2004 and 
continuing for as long as the MOX facility is in use, the Secretary 
shall submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the plan 
required by paragraph (1).
