consumer maintains or has maintained an account, to the extent that 
information is in the files of the agency, when presented with a 
written request for that information, signed by the Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, or the Director's designee, which 
certifies compliance with this section. The Director or the Director's 
designee may make such a certification only if the Director or the 
Director's designee has determined in writing that--

        authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation; and
            ``(2) there are specific and articulable facts giving 
        reason to believe that the consumer--
                    ``(A) is a foreign power (as defined in section 101 
                of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) 
                or a person who is not a United States person (as 
                defined in such section 101) and is an official of a 
                foreign power; or

                engaging or has engaged in international terrorism (as 
                that term is defined in section 101(c) of the Foreign 
                Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) or clandestine

section 604 or any other provision of this title, a consumer reporting 
agency shall furnish identifying information respecting a consumer, 
limited to name, address, former addresses, places of employment, or 
former places of employment, to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
when presented with a written request, signed by the Director or the 
Director's designee, which certifies compliance with this subsection. 
The Director or the Director's designee may make such a certification 
only if the Director or the Director's designee has determined in 
writing that--
                    ``(A) such information is necessary to the conduct 
                of an authorized counterintelligence investigation; and
                    ``(B) there is information giving reason to believe 
                that the consumer has been, or is about to be, in

                power (as defined in section 101 of the Foreign 
                Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978).
    ``(c) Court Order for Disclosure of Consumer Reports.--
Notwithstanding section 604 or any other provision of this title, if 
requested in writing by the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, or a designee of the Director, a court may issue an 
order ex parte directing a consumer reporting agency to furnish a 
consumer report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, upon a showing 
in camera that--
            ``(1) the consumer report is necessary for the conduct of 
        an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation; and
            ``(2) there are specific and articulable facts giving 
        reason to believe that the consumer whose consumer report is 
        sought--

                    ``(B) is engaging or has engaged in international 
                terrorism (as that term is defined in section 101(c) of 
                the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) or

identity of financial institutions or a consumer report respecting any 
consumer under subsection (a), (b), or (c) and no consumer reporting

subject to the availability of appropriations, pay to the consumer 
reporting agency assembling or providing reports or information in

books, papers, records, or other data required or requested to be 
produced under this section.
    ``(f) Limit on Dissemination.--The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
may not disseminate information obtained pursuant to this section 
outside of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, except to the 
Department of Justice as may be necessary for the approval or conduct 
of a foreign counterintelligence investigation, or, where the 
information concerns a person subject to the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice, to appropriate investigative authorities within the military 
department concerned as may be necessary for the conduct of a joint 
foreign counterintelligence investigation.
    ``(g) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to prohibit information from being furnished by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation pursuant to a subpoena or court order, or in 
connection with a judicial or administrative proceeding to enforce the 
provisions of this Act. Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
authorize or permit the withholding or information from the Congress.
    ``(h) Reports to Congress.--On a semiannual basis, the Attorney 
General of the United States shall fully inform the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the Select Committee

Affairs of the Senate concerning all requests made pursuant to 
subsections (a), (b), and (c).
    ``(i) Damages.--Any agency or department of the United States 
obtaining or disclosing any consumer reports, records, or information 
contained therein in violation of this section is liable to the 
consumer to whom such consumer reports, records, or information relate 
in an amount equal to the sum of--
            ``(1) $100, without regard to the volume of consumer 
        reports, records, or information involved;
            ``(2) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a 
        result of the disclosure;

        together with reasonable attorney fees, as determined by the 
        court.
    ``(j) Disciplinary Actions for Violations.--If a court determines 
that any agency or department of the United States has violated any 
provision of this section and the court finds that the circumstances 
surrounding the violation raise questions of whether or not an officer 
or employee of the agency or department acted willfully or 
intentionally with respect to the violation, the agency or department 
shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether or not 
disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who 
was responsible for the violation.
    ``(k) Good-Faith Exception.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this title, any consumer reporting agency or agent or employee thereof 
making disclosure of consumer reports or identifying information 
pursuant to this subsection in good-faith reliance upon a certification 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation pursuant to provisions of this 
section shall not be liable to any person for such disclosure under 
this title, the constitution of any State, or any law or regulation of 
any State or any political subdivision of any State.

        repair organizations which offer to improve the credit standing 
        of such consumers.
            ``(2) Certain advertising and business practices of some 
        companies engaged in the business of credit repair services

        those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in 
        credit matters.
    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:
            ``(1) To ensure that prospective buyers of the services of 
        credit repair organizations are provided with the information 
        necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase 
        of such services.
            ``(2) To protect the public from unfair or deceptive 
        advertising and business practices by credit repair 
        organizations.

``SEC. 403. DEFINITIONS.

    ``For purposes of this title--
            ``(1) Consumer.--The term `consumer' means an individual.

contract or agreement between the consumer and the credit repair 
organization is executed:

       ```Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law

    ```You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your 
credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, 
neither you nor any ``credit repair'' company or credit repair 
organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable 
information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must 
remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is 
over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.
    ```You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a 
credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, 
however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, 
insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit 
report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide 
someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You 
are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are 
unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if 
you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason 
to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report 
due to fraud.
    ```You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that 
violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits 
deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.
    ```You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit 
repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date 
you signed it.
    ```Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to 
ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes 
may occur.
    ```You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you 
dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit 
bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or 
incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for 
this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you 
have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.
    ```If the credit bureau's reinvestigation does not resolve the 
dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the 
credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the 
record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your 
statement about disputed information with any report it issues about 
you.
    ```The Federal Trade Commission regulates credit bureaus and credit 
repair organizations. For more information contact:
