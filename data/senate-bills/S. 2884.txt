  (b) ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS- Funds appropriated or otherwise made available
  to the Air Force for the procurement of aircraft for fiscal year 1991 may
  not be obligated for the procurement of the two new production B-2 aircraft
  authorized by this Act until--
  (1) the conditions provided for in section 111 of the National Defense
  Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-189;
  103 Stat. 1371), limiting the obligation of fiscal year 1990 funds for
  the B-2 aircraft, have been met; and
  (2) the Secretary of Defense has submitted to the congressional defense
  committees the certification required by section 112 of such Act.
  (c) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The United States has devoted substantial resources over the past several
  decades to the strategic bomber force, including substantial resources for--
  (A) significant upgrades to B-52 aircraft;
  (B) research, development, and procurement of B-1 aircraft; and
  (C) research, development, and procurement of air-launched cruise missiles.
  (2) The United States has currently invested a total of $26,700,000,000
  in research and development and low-rate initial production in connection
  with the B-2 bomber aircraft program.
  (3) Funds have been approved for the procurement of 15 production B-2
  aircraft through fiscal year 1990, but Congress has made no determination
  as to the total number of such aircraft that should be produced.
  (4) Congress has established, in accordance with the `fly before you buy'
  principle, a series of rigorous test and evaluation requirements, most of
  which have not yet been completed, to assess the efficiency, effectiveness,
  and cost of the B-2 aircraft.
  (5) Serious questions have been raised about the ability of the B-2 program
  to meet cost, schedule, performance, and financial integrity requirements.
  (6) Fiscal year 1991 will constitute the sixth consecutive fiscal year
  for which the amount appropriated for national defense functions of the
  Government declined (after adjusting for inflation) from the preceding
  fiscal year.
  (7) Expected limitations on future defense budgets make it essential that
  the Nation's defense priorities be carefully analyzed so as to obtain the
  most efficient and effective funding of the Armed Forces, including the
  various elements of the Nation's strategic forces.
  (d) SENSE OF CONGRESS- In light of the findings in subsection (c), it is
  the sense of Congress that--
  (1) it is not prudent or possible at this time to commit to production of
  B-2 aircraft beyond the number of aircraft authorized by this and prior Acts;
  (2) before a commitment is made to proceed with procurement of B-2
  aircraft beyond the number of aircraft authorized by this and prior Acts,
  the Secretary of Defense must resolve those issues associated with cost,
  schedule, performance and financial integrity of the program and submit
  to the congressional defense committees the certifications required by
  subsection (e)(3).
  (e) ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON OBLIGATION OF FUNDS FOR NEW B-2 AIRCRAFT- The
  funds described in subsection (b) may not be obligated for the procurement
  of the two new production B-2 aircraft authorized by this Act until each
  of the following conditions has been met:

  Panel conducts an independent review of the test data resulting from the
  early Block 2 flight testing and submits to the Secretary of Defense a
  report on the results of that review, together with the panel's findings
  and conclusions.
  (2) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation submits to the Secretary
  of Defense the Director's evaluation of the results of the Block 2 flight
  testing to the date of the report of the Defense Science Board referred
  to in paragraph (1).

  (C) The results of early Block 2 flight testing of the B-2 aircraft
  (including testing of low- observables and flying qualities and performance)
  are satisfactory.
  (D) No significant technical or operational problems have been identified
  during early Block 2 flight testing.
  (E) The performance milestones for the B-2 aircraft for the previous
  fiscal year for both developmental test and evaluation and operational
  test and evaluation (as contained in the latest full performance matrix
  for the B-2 aircraft program established under section 232(a) of Public
  Law 100-456 and section 121 of Public Law 100-180) have been met.
  (F) The B-2 aircraft has a high probability of being able to perform its
  intended missions.
  (G) Any proposed modification to the performance matrix referred to in
  subparagraph (E) will be provided in writing in advance to the congressional
  defense committees.
  (H) The cost reduction initiatives established for the B-2 program can
  be achieved (such certification to be submitted together with details for
  the savings to be realized).
  (I) The quality assurance practices and fiscal management controls of the
  prime contractor and major subcontractors associated with the B-2 program
  meet or exceed accepted United States Government standards.
  (4) A period of 30 calendar days expires after the date on which the
  certification required by paragraph (3) is received.
  (f) FULL PERFORMANCE MATRIX REQUIREMENTS- (1) Of the amounts made available
  for fiscal year 1991 for the procurement of two new production B-2 aircraft,

SEC. 222. LIMITATIONS ON THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) has become too focused on a
  projected 1993 Presidential decision on whether the United States will deploy
  a space-based kinetic energy weapon system, known as `brilliant pebbles'.
  (2) There has been tremendous instability in the Phase I architecture of
  the strategic defense system.
  (3) A decision to deploy the phase I architecture of that system would
  have grave implications for offensive arms reduction negotiations with
  the Soviet Union and for continued United States compliance with the 1972
  Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
  (4) Changes in the international political environment over the past year
  permit the United States to pursue the SDI program at a more measured pace,
  with increased emphasis on theater and anti-tactical ballistic missile
  contingencies.
  (5) A broad-based research program on the feasibility of highly effective
  missile defenses remains in the national interest.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
  (1) the Strategic Defense Initiative should not be focused on the projected
  1993 Presidential decision on deployment of a space-based kinetic energy
  weapon system;
  (2) the Strategic Defense Initiative should continue a balanced, robust
  program of research on those technologies that offer the prospect of highly
  effective anti-ballistic missile defenses;
  (3) priority under the Strategic Defense Initiative should be given,
  in the near term, to research on a defense system that (A) would protect
  against an accidental missile launch against the United States or a limited
  ballistic missile attack against the United States by a third-world country,
  and (B) if deployed, would not be in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
  Missile Treaty.
  (4) the Strategic Defense Initiative should include a vigorous pursuit of
  a variety of theater and anti-tactical ballistic missile defenses which
  would be of value to allies of the United States and to the military forces
  of the United States temporarily or permanently deployed within range of
  tactical ballistic missiles of a potential enemy; and
  (5) the Strategic Defense Initiative should continue support, as it has
  over the past six years, for those critical technology efforts that have
  both civil and military applications in areas other than ballistic missile
  defense systems.
  (c) LIMITATIONS ON SPENDING- Of the funds authorized to be appropriated
  pursuant to section 201 for the Strategic Defense Initiative--
  (1) not more than $345,000,000 may be obligated for the ground-based radar,
  space-based surveillance and tracking system program, and ground-based
  surveillance and tracking system program;
  (2) not more than $142,000,000 may be obligated for the ground-based
  interceptor program;
  (3) not more than $129,000,000 may be obligated for the brilliant pebbles
  program;
  (4) not more than $894,300,000 may be obligated for other phase I programs;
  (5) not more than $944,400,000 may be obligated for follow-on technologies
  programs;
  (6) not more than $320,000,000 may be obligated for key technologies
  activities;
  (7) not more than $227,800,000 may be obligated for operational support
  and management activities;
  (8) not more than $180,000,000 may be obligated for test and evaluation
  activities;
  (9) not more than $180,000,000 may be obligated for theater defense
  activities, of which not more than $42,000,000 may be expended for an
  advanced development program for an anti-tactical ballistic missile system
  with the Government of Israel;
  (10) not more than $116,800,000 may be obligated for the innovative science
  and technology and small business innovative research programs; and
  (11) not more than $93,700,000 may be obligated for engineering analysis
  activities.
  (d) BUDGET INFORMATION- With respect to each program and activity specified
  in clauses (1) through (11) of subsection (c), the Secretary of Defense
  shall include in budget justification materials submitted to Congress after
  the date of the enactment of this Act for any fiscal year, and in each
  annual report submitted to Congress after such date pursuant to section
  224 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and
  1991 (10 U.S.C. 2431 note), a description of the program or activity, any
  changes made in the program or activity since the last budget justification
  materials were submitted to Congress or the last annual report was submitted,
  as the case may be, and the amount budgeted for that program or activity
  for the fiscal year concerned.
  (e) REPORT- (1) The Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional
  defense committees a report on the allocation of funds appropriated for
  the Strategic Defense Initiative for fiscal year 1991. The report shall
  specify the amount of such funds allocated for each program, project,
  and activity of the Strategic Defense Initiative, including the amount
  allocated for each of the programs named in subsection (c).
  (2) The report required by paragraph (1) shall be submitted not later than
  90 days after the date of the enactment of legislation appropriating funds
  for the Strategic Defense Initiative for fiscal year 1991.
  (f) CONSTRUCTION OF TERMS- As used in this section:
  (1) The terms `Phase I', `follow-on technologies', `key technologies',
  `operational support and management', `test and evaluation', `theater
  defense', `innovative science and technology', `small business innovative
  research', and `engineering analysis' shall be interpreted consistent
  with the use of those terms in the testimony of Lieutenant General George
  L. Monahan, and the materials presented by General Monahan, before the
  Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on June 20, 1990, except that

  procedures prescribed pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) for procurement
  of commercial products (including incidental services) by the Department
  of Defense.
  (2) The Secretary shall designate one component of the Department of Defense
  for participation in the test program. A component may not be selected
  for such designation if the total dollar value of all procurement actions
  taken during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1989, by that component
  exceeded 15 percent of the dollar value of all procurement actions of the
  Department of Defense in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1989.
  (3) The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations implementing the test
  program procedures for the participating component to award contracts for
  commercial products without discussions on the basis of factors specified
  in the solicitation. Notwithstanding section 2305(b)(4)(A)(ii) of title 10,
  United States Code, the factors that may be specified in the solicitation
  include cost, product quality, and product performance (including the past
  performance of products and sources) if the solicitation also--
  (A) contains a market acceptability demonstration requirement described
  in section 303H(e) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services
  Act of 1949 (as amended by subsection (f)); and
  (B) is expected to result in the purchase of commercial products that do
  not require modification for use by the component.
  (4)(A) The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations implementing the test
  program procedures for the participating component--
  (i) to prescribe a list of commercial products for procurement using
  such procedures;
  (ii) to establish a list of sources of one or more of such commercial
  products; and
  (iii) to issue a series of solicitations for the acquisition of such
  commercial products to sources on the established source lists over a
  specified period when the head of the participating component reasonably
  anticipates that all such sources will have an opportunity to respond to
  at least one solicitation for such a product (involving approximately the
  same total quantity as is provided for in every other solicitation for
  such product) within a two-year period.
  (B) The regulations shall require the participating component to publish
  each list of commercial products that may be procured under the procedures
  prescribed pursuant to this paragraph. A product may be on the list only if--
  (i) no modification of the product by the offeror is necessary for the
  product to be usable by the component;
  (ii) the product is frequently procured by the United States in large
  quantities;
  (iii) award of a contract for such product to a source after the use of such
  procedures will not bias the participating component in favor of awarding
  future contracts for the procurement of the same product to that source;
  (iv) the head of the component reasonably anticipates that the product
  will be procured several times in relatively equal quantities as a result
  of a series of solicitations over a two-year period;
  (v) the head of the participating component reasonably anticipates that
  a contract for such product could be awarded on the basis of an initial
  proposal that would result in the lowest overall cost to the government;
  (vi) based upon past experience, the Secretary of Defense reasonably
  anticipates that a large number of qualified offerors would respond to a
  solicitation for a contract for such product and a significant savings in
  personnel and administrative costs could be achieved using such procedures;
  and
  (vii) a notice of a proposal to place the product on the list of products,
  including a product description conforming to section 18(b) of the Office
  of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416(b)) and section 8(f)
  of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(f)), has been published in the
  Federal Register and the Commerce Business Daily for a period of not less
  than 60 days.
  (C) The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A) shall authorize the
  participating component to solicit participation by interested persons in a
  list of sources to be prescribed under the test program. Participation in
  the list shall be solicited by publication of one or more public notices
  in the Commerce Business Daily. The notice shall include--
  (i) a product description conforming to section 18(b) of the Office of
  Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416(b)) and section 8(f) of the
  Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(f));
  (ii) the scope of the requirement to be covered by the solicitations,
  including the number of solicitations expected, anticipated quantities,
  and the time period during which such solicitations will be issued; and
  (iii) a requirement that each interested source submit appropriate product
  information with the request of the source to be placed on the source list.
  (D) A list of sources for a series of solicitations established under the
  procedures prescribed pursuant to this paragraph shall include--
  (i) each person who requests to be placed on the list and submits the
  required information specified in the public notice within the time period
  specified in that notice; and
  (ii) any additional person who submits the required information sufficiently
  in advance of a solicitation to ensure that the submission can be adequately
  evaluated before the solicitation is issued.
  (E) The Secretary shall prescribe in the regulations procedures for a source
  to protest a decision not to place such source on a source list under the
  test program. The availability of such procedures may not be construed to
  preclude a source from seeking relief under existing bid protest procedures.
  (F) The Secretary shall prescribe in the regulations the minimum number
  of qualified sources that must be included on a source list established
  under the procedures prescribed pursuant to this paragraph. The minimum
  number of sources may not be less than 100 source during the one-year period
  beginning on the effective date of such regulations. After the expiration of
  such one-year period, the Secretary may modify the regulations to specify a
  number of sources less than 100 sources, but not less than 25 sources, if the
  Secretary determines that the modification is necessary in order to ensure
  that the procedures prescribed under this paragraph are tested effectively.
  (G) A component may issue solicitations for procurement of a product
  to sources on a source list established under this paragraph in such a
  manner that--
  (i) each source on the list is invited to respond to at least one
  solicitation for such product before any source is invited to respond to
  a second solicitation;
  (ii) all sources on the list, or as many sources as practicable, have an
  opportunity to respond to at least one such solicitation; and
  (iii) each solicitation is open to not fewer than 20 percent of the sources
  on the source list and the sources are selected to receive the solicitation
  under procedures prescribed by the Secretary to ensure equitable opportunity
  for participation by all of the selected sources.
  (H) A solicitation for a product may not be issued pursuant to the
  regulations prescribed under this paragraph if the estimated price of the
  procurement exceeds a maximum amount which the Secretary shall prescribe
  for such a solicitation in such regulations.
  (5) A participating component may not use both sets of procedures prescribed
  pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) for the procurement of one product.
  (6) No solicitation may be issued pursuant to the regulations prescribed
  to implement the test program more than three years after the date on
  which such regulations take effect.
  (7)(A) Within 180 days after the termination of the test program, the
  Comptroller General of the United States shall evaluate the test program
  and submit a report to the congressional defense committees, the Committee
  on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Government
  Operations of the House of Representatives. The report shall contain the
  Comptroller General's evaluation of the effects of the test program on--
  (i) the price and quality of products procured by the participating
  component;
  (ii) paperwork requirements and procurement lead times for the procurement
  of products by such component;
  (iii) competition and the bid protest system; and
  (iv) levels of participation of small businesses and small, disadvantaged
  businesses in the test program.
  (B) The head of the participating component shall collect and make available
  to the Comptroller General appropriate data on contracts awarded under
  the test program in order to enable the Comptroller General to complete
  the evaluation required by this paragraph. The Administrator for Federal
  Procurement Policy, in consultation with the Comptroller General, shall
  provide guidance to the head of the participating component regarding the
  data to be collected for review by the Comptroller General.
  (c) REGULATIONS- (1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment
  of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall publish for public comment--
  (A) proposed new regulations to carry out the requirements in the amendments
  made by subsection (a) (including any proposed regulation that rescinds,
  waives, or limits any regulation inconsistent with the requirements of
  such amendments); and
  (B) proposed regulations to implement the test program required by subsection
  (b).
  (2) Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,
  the Secretary shall promulgate (A) final regulations to carry out such
  amendments and to rescind, waives, or limit any regulation inconsistent
  with the requirements of such amendments, and (B) final regulations to
  implement the test program.
  (d) PROPOSALS TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS ON ACQUISITION OF
  COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS- (1) The Secretary of Defense may submit to Congress
  proposed legislation regarding any provision of law that the Secretary
  considers an unnecessary restriction on the acquisition of commercial
  items. Any such proposed legislation shall include--
  (A) a description of the existing law and its effect on the acquisition
  of commercial items, including specific examples;
  (B) draft legislation;
  (C) a description of the manner in which the proposal will alter existing
  acquisition practices to facilitate the acquisition of commercial items;
  (D) a description of the manner in which the proposal will preserve the
  integrity of the acquisition process; and
  (E) any costs or savings associated with the proposal.
  (2) In this subsection, the term `commercial item' has the meaning given
  such term in section 2325(b)(8) of title 10, United States Code, as amended
  by subsection (a).
  (e) TECHNICAL AMENDMENT- The item relating to section 2325 in the table

  supplies are stated in terms of--
  `(i) functions to be performed;

  `(iii) essential physical characteristics;
  `(B) such requirements are defined so that nondevelopmental items may be
  procured to fulfill such requirements;
  `(C) such requirements are fulfilled through the procurement of

  `(b)(1)(A) The Federal Acquisition Regulation issued under section 25(c)
  of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 421(c)) shall

  the uniform contract and subcontract clauses developed under this subsection.
  `(c) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall ensure, to the maximum extent

  and
  `(2) Federal agencies take advantage of warranties offered by commercial
  contractors and use such warranties for the repair and replacement of
  commercial items.
  `(d)(1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall ensure that, to the maximum

  `(C) clarification that an agency may not, in the case of any item for
  which the Administrator of General Services has accepted a certificate of
  established catalog price, require a contractor to demonstrate that such
  an item meets the requirements of section 304(d)(5)(A)(ii) of the Federal
  Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 254(d)(5)(A)(ii))
  during the period in which a contract to which the certification relates
  is in effect.
  `(e) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall direct agencies to require,
  where appropriate and in accordance with criteria prescribed in the
  regulations, offerors to demonstrate in their offers that products being
  offered have--

  indicate that the products are suitable for the agency's use or that the
  processes used to manufacture the products meet established commercial or
  other specified standards; or

  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) Japan has developed highly sophisticated research and manufacturing
  capabilities.
  (2) Those capabilities have produced technologies that can be usefully
  applied to the development and manufacture of both commercial products
  and defense equipment.
  (3) The availability of those technologies to the United States would
  greatly enhance the development and manufacture of defense equipment for
  the Armed Forces of the United States.
  (4) Since the exchange of notes between the United States and Japan on the
  transfer of Japanese military technologies in 1983, the level and quality of
  technological cooperation between the two countries have been unsatisfactory.
  (5) Effective cooperation in technology research and development between
  the United States and Japan would enhance the security of both countries.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
  (1) the United States and Japan should strengthen their cooperation with
  regard to technology that would contribute to the security of both countries;
  (2) technological cooperation between the two countries should be based
  upon an equitable and mutual sharing of the costs and benefits of that
  cooperation; and
  (3) the Secretary of Defense should improve the staffing, funding, and
  organization of those activities within the Department of Defense responsible
  for implementing and overseeing technological cooperation with Japan.
  (c) COOPERATION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT- In light of the expressions
  in subsections (a) and (b), Congress urges and requests the President and
  directs the Secretary of Defense to pursue vigorously opportunities for
  the United States and Japan to cooperate in the development of technologies
  that benefit the security of both countries, particularly those technologies
  that have both commercial and military applications, commonly referred to as
  `dual-use' technologies.

  participation of such business concerns as subcontractors and suppliers
  in Department of Defense contract business.
  (c) PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS- (1) A business concern meeting the eligibility
  requirements set out in subsection (d) may enter into agreements under
  subsection (e) and furnish assistance to disadvantaged small business
  concerns under the pilot program pursuant to such agreement upon making
  application to the Secretary of Defense and being approved for participation
  in the pilot program by the Secretary. A business concern approved for
  participation pursuant to this paragraph shall be known, for the purposes
  of the pilot program, as a `mentor firm'.

  as a protege firm under the pilot program. However, the Secretary may
  disapprove the participation of a disadvantaged small business concern in
  the program on the basis of criteria which the Secretary shall specify in
  the regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (k). If the Secretary
  disapproves the participation of a disadvantaged small business concern in
  the program, he shall transmit a written notification of such disapproval to
  the disadvantaged small business concern and the mentor firm furnishing the
  assistance. Assistance furnished that disadvantaged small business concern
  by the mentor firm after the mentor firm receives such notification may
  not be considered as assistance furnished under the pilot program.
  (d) MENTOR FIRM ELIGIBILITY- A business concern generally eligible for
  award of contracts by the Department of Defense is eligible to enter into an
  agreement with a protege firm under subsection (e) and to furnish assistance
  under the pilot program pursuant to that agreement if, during the fiscal
  year preceding the fiscal year in which the business concern enters into
  the agreement, the total amount of the Department of Defense contracts
  awarded such business concern and the subcontracts awarded such business
  concern under Department of Defense contracts was equal to or greater than--
  (1) $100,000,000; or
  (2) such lesser amount as the Secretary specifies in the regulations
  prescribed pursuant to subsection (k) for application to any business concern
  which is a disadvantaged small business concern or, except for the size
  of that business concern, would be a disadvantaged small business concern.

  protege firm under the pilot program, a mentor firm shall enter into a
  mentor-protege agreement with the protege firm regarding the assistance to

  costs incurred by the protege firm for the performance.
  (4) Advance payments under such a subcontract.
  (5) Loans.
  (6) Cash in exchange for an ownership interest in the protege firm, not
  to exceed 10 percent of the total ownership interest.

  counted in the amount for which the mentor firm receives credit for purposes
  of determining whether the mentor firm attains a subcontracting participation
  goal applicable to such mentor firm under a Department of Defense contract.

  subcontracting participation goal, if any, applicable to such mentor firm
  under the contract.
  (5) A mentor firm shall receive credit toward the attainment of a
  subcontracting participation goal applicable to such mentor firm under a
  Department of Defense contract for each subcontract for a product or service
  awarded under such contract by a mentor firm to a business concern that,

  mentor firm and such business concern entered into the mentor-protege
  agreement referred to in clause (B) of such paragraph.
  (h) NONAFFILIATION TREATMENT- For purposes of the Small Business Act,
  a protege firm may not be considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely
  on the basis that the protege firm is receiving assistance referred to in
  subsection (f) from such mentor firm under the pilot program.
  (i) PARTICIPATION IN PILOT PROGRAM NOT TO BE A CONDITION FOR AWARD OF A
  CONTRACT OR SUBCONTRACT- A mentor firm may not require a business concern

  need for global power projection in low-intensity and medium-intensity
  conflicts.
  (C) An assessment of how such requirements would be affected by the loss
  of United States military bases, and the loss of access to other military
  bases, in such overseas locations as the Philippines.
  (D) An assessment of how the reduced reliance expected to be placed by
  the Armed Forces on NATO and other allied shipping and military bases for
  employment of the Armed Forces unilaterally in contingent actions affects
  the requirements for airlift, sealift, amphibious lift, and prepositioned
  war materials.
  (E) An assessment of whether increased dependence should be placed
  upon sealift capabilities in view of the factors assessed pursuant
  to subparagraphs (A) through (D) and the potential benefits of sealift
  vessels which might be developed that would be faster than the sealift
  vessels currently available from commercial sources.
  (F) A discussion of initiatives that can be undertaken to reduce the
  time required to move forces and material from home bases to combat
  areas, including measures that can be undertaken to reduce (i) the time
  necessary for loading and unloading personnel and equipment at airports
  and seaports, (ii) the time necessary for moving ground forces to airports

SEC. 1104. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF
COUNTERNARCOTICS FUNDS AND REPORT REQUIREMENT.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) Secretary Cheney has declared that combating illegal drugs is a high
  priority national security mission for the Department of Defense;
  (2) All funds authorized and appropriated for Operations and Maintenance
  and Military Personnel in the Department of Defense's counternarcotics
  budget for Fiscal Year 1990 have not been obligated;
  (3) If such funds are not obligated during Fiscal Year 1990 such funds
  will no longer be available for counternarcotics efforts; and
  (4) Such funds should not be allowed to lapse.
  (b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary
  of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must continue to
  emphasize the Department of Defense's commitment to this extremely important
  mission so that the entire chain of command ensures that funds are fully
  and effectively utilized so as to maximize the military's contribution to
  the national counter-drug efforts.
  (c) REPORT- Not later than January 15, 1991, the General Accounting
  Office shall report to the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and
  the House of Representatives, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on
  Defense, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, and the Senate
  Caucus on International Narcotics Control on the Department of Defense's
  counternarcotics budget, providing the following:
  (1) An analysis of the funds authorized and appropriated in Fiscal
  Year 1989; how these funds were obligated and expended, including a
  month-by-month breakdown of obligations and expenditures; if there were
  delays in obligating and expending these funds; why such delays occurred;
  and the amount of funds which had lapsed at the end of the fiscal year.
  (2) An analysis of the funds authorized and appropriated in Fiscal
  Year 1990; how these funds were obligated and expended, including a
  month-by-month breakdown of obligations and expenditures; if there were
  delays in obligating and expending these funds; why such delays occurred;
  and the amount of funds which had lapsed at the end of the fiscal year.
  (3) An analysis of whether there is any information available with respect
  to the obligations and expenditures from the Fiscal Year 1989 and Fiscal
  Year 1990 counternarcotics budget that suggest a systemic problem in
  reference to the timely obligation and expenditure of counternarcotics funds.
  (4) An analysis of the effectiveness of the role of the Department of
  Defense Coordinator for Drug Enforcement Policy and Support; whether his
  dual responsibility as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs
  and as Drug Coordinator complicates his ability to coordinate all entities
  within the Department of Defense in the counternarcotics mission; and the
  adequacy of personnel levels in his Office to meet his responsibility for
  coordinating these funds and ensuring that the funds are obligated and
  expended in a timely manner.
  (5) Recommendations for correcting any problems found in the course of
  this review.
SEC. 1105. STUDY OF UTILITY OF OH-58D HELICOPTER IN DETECTION OF CROSS-BORDER
INTRUSIONS BY DRUG SMUGGLERS
  (a) STUDY REQUIRED- The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a study on the
  feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing OH-58D Scout helicopters for
  detecting, monitoring, and conducting surveillance of the ground movements
  of drug smugglers along the southwest border of the United States. In
  carrying out such study, the Secretary shall consider in particular the
  following matters:
  (1) The suitability of the OH-58D helicopter for performing the missions
  described in the first sentence.
  (2) The feasibility of having personnel of the Army National Guard operate
  and maintain OH-58D helicopters when such personnel are not in Federal
  service.
  (3) The desirability of having the Army pay for operation and maintenance
  expenses in connection with the OH-58D helicopters pursuant to a plan
  developed by the United States Customs Service or having the Secretary of
  Defense pay such expenses out of funds appropriated for National Guard
  counterdrug activities pursuant to a plan developed by the Governors of
  Southwestern States.
  (4) The feasibility of coordinating National Guard activities and civilian
  law enforcement activities though the command, control and intelligence
  center of the United States Customs Service at Riverside, California.
  (b) INTERAGENCY COORDINATION- The Secretary shall carry out the study
  required by subsection (a) in consultation with the Commissioner of the

  containing the results of the study required by subsection (a) not more
  than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary
  shall include in the report the conclusions of the Secretary based on
  the study together with such comments and recommendation as the Secretary
  considers appropriate.
SEC. 1106. ANDEAN ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS
  (a) The Congress finds that--
  (1) support for democratic process and civilian governance in Andean
  countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, the first two of which have only
  recently emerged from periods of military rule, is a necessary precondition
  for the successful fight against narcotics production and traffic and
  long-term stability in that region;
  (2) separation of military and civilian law enforcement functions has
  historically been a critical element in democracies around the world,
  including the United States;
  (3) there is a need to determine whether existing United States policies
  unduly emphasize assistance to military entities rather than civilian law
  enforcement entities in the Andean anti-drug effort and whether such policies
  might tend to undermine the dual long-term policy goals of the United States
  of stopping the traffic of drugs at their sources and the preservation of
  civilian control over the newly established democracies of this region; and
  (4) there is a need to assess the impact that United States assistance
  in the Andean anti-drug effort will have on reducing drug activity and
  supporting democratic processes in this region.
  (b)(1) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act,
  the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense shall, in consultation
  with the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, jointly
  submit a report to the Senate and the House of Representatives detailing
  current United States policies, anti-narcotics enforcement activities and
  associated training programs in the Andean region.
  (2) Such report shall also include an analysis of the impact of the
  Andean countries' militaries' role in counter-narcotics enforcement on
  democratic institutions in the region and how civilian institutions might
  be strengthened in order to assure the successful pursuit of anti-narcotics
  strategy.
  (3) Such report shall contain specific legislative recommendations as may
  be necessary to clarify and streamline United States assistance activities
  in order to avoid unnecessary duplications and contradictions in meeting
  United States policy goals in the Andean region.
SEC. 1107. CREATION OF A MULTILATERAL COUNTER NARCOTICS STRIKE FORCE
  It is the sense of the Congress that the President should call for
  international negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on the establishment
  of an international strike force to counter major international drug
  traffickers.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) the United States Congress has in the past sought approval for a
  multilateral strike force dedicated to the war on drugs;
  (2) the proposal to create a multilateral, international counternarcotics
  force as proposed by Prime Minister Michael Manley of Jamaica, is a plan
  worthy of consideration; and
  (3) the Manley plan is the first operative proposal for the use of a
  multilateral force against the drug cartels in Latin America made by a
  government leader in the Western Hemisphere.
  (b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS- It is therefore the sense of the Congress that--
  (1) Prime Minister Manley of Jamaica is to be commended for his proposal; and
  (2) the United States should work through the United Nations and other
  multilateral organizations to determine the feasibility of such a force and
  to assist in the establishment of this force, if it is found to be feasible.

  political tensions within the Soviet Union, concern has heightened regarding
  the possible unauthorized or accidental use of Soviet nuclear weapons.
  (4) It has been four years since the Department of Defense conducted
  a comprehensive review of its nuclear control procedures and failsafe
  mechanisms.
  (5) The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in its 1990 Joint Military Net Assessment,
  concluded that with the recent changes in the global security environment,
  `the risk of nuclear deterrence failing is assessed to be low and at this
  moment to be decreasing'.
  (6) While Congress is concerned about continued Soviet strategic offensive
  and defensive modernization and the unpredictable status of the Soviet
  domestic situation, at this stage the lessened prospects that nuclear weapons
  of the United States might have to be employed may afford an opportunity to
  reconsider past reluctance to utilize certain positive control measures,
  such as the installation of permissive action links (PALs) on nuclear
  weapons deployed at sea by the United States and the installation of
  post-launch destruct mechanisms on intercontinental ballistic missiles
  (ICBMs) and submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) deployed by the
  United States, as long as appropriate security measures can be developed
  to protect the integrity of such destruct mechanisms.
  (7) On September 15, 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed
  to establish Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers (NRRCs) in Washington and Moscow.
  (8) The NRRCs have made a useful contribution to lowering the risks
  of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war and are capable of taking on
  expanded roles.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
  (1) the President of the United States and the President of the Union of
  Soviet Socialist Republics are to be commended for their June 1, 1990, joint
  statement to pursue additional nuclear confidence-building measures; and
  (2) in keeping with that joint statement, the President should--
  (A) invite the Soviet Union to join with the United States in conducting
  separate but parallel, comprehensive reviews of each nation's own nuclear
  control procedures and failsafe mechanisms; and
  (B) propose to the Soviet Union that the two nations initiate discussions
  with the objective of agreeing on additional roles and functions that could
  be assigned to the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers to further lessen the
  risks of the outbreak of nuclear war as the result of misinterpretation,
  miscalculation, or accident.
  (c) REPORT ON ADDITIONAL MEASURES- Not later than March 1, 1991, the
  President shall submit to Congress a report (in classified and unclassified
  form) assessing additional nuclear risk reduction measures which could be
  implemented pursuant to the joint statement of June 1, 1990, referred to
  in subsection (b), including the following:
  (1) Assigning the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers (NRRCs) such expanded
  roles as the following:
   (A) Serving as the locus for discussions between the two nations on
   responding to possible nuclear terrorism.
  (B) Transmitting notifications that may be required under future arms
  control treaties.
  (C) Transmitting notifications and information requests required under
  Article 5 of the 1971 Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Risk of Outbreak
  of Nuclear War Between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist
  Republics.
  (D) Providing a forum for discussions between the United States and the
  Soviet Union on restricting nuclear, chemical, and missile proliferation.
  (E) Serving as a meeting place for high-level military discussions on
  nuclear doctrines, forces and activities, and regional security concerns.
  (2) Installation of post-launch destruct mechanisms on all intercontinental
  ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine launched ballistic missiles
  (SLBMs) deployed by the United States.
  (3) Installation by the United States of permissive action links (PALs)
  on all nuclear weapons at sea.

Part D--Congressional Findings; Policies; and Commendations
SEC. 1241. OVERVIEW PRESENTATION OF MILITARY STRATEGY
  It is the sense of the Congress that the President should provide for the
  Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the minority
  leaders of the House and Senate, and the chairmen and ranking minority
  members of the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of the House
  and Senate to be given annually an overview presentation on the United
  States top-level military strategy and its implementation by strategic
  forces, including the impact on targeting requirements, resources, and
  force structure.
SEC. 1242. START AND STRATEGIC MODERNIZATION
  (a) FINDINGS- The Senate makes the following findings:
  (1) The United States and the Soviet Union are engaged in the Strategic
  Arms Reduction Talks (START).
  (2) In the Joint Statement on the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms signed
  in June 1990, the two sides reaffirmed their determination to have the
  treaty completed and ready for signature by the end of this year.
  (3) Under the provisions of a START Treaty, both sides will carry out
  significant reductions in strategic offensive arms.
  (4) In the Joint Statement on Future Negotiations on Nuclear and Space
  Arms and Further Enhancing Strategic Stability, the United States and
  the Soviet Union agreed to pursue new talks on strategic offensive arms,
  and on the relationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms.
  (5) The objectives of these negotiations will be to reduce further the
  risk of outbreak of war, particularly nuclear war, and to ensure strategic
  stability, transparency and predictability through further stabilizing
  reductions in the strategic arsenals of both countries.
  (6) The President's effort to negotiate such agreements is dependent upon
  the maintenance of a vigorous research and development and modernization
  program as required for a prudent defense posture.
  (7) The Soviet Union has maintained a robust strategic modernization program
  throughout the course of the START negotiations which continues today.
  (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--
  (1) the Senate fully supports United States efforts to enhance strategic
  stability; and
  (2) the United States should pursue stabilizing strategic arms reduction
  agreements while maintaining a vigorous research and development and
  modernization program for United States strategic forces.
SEC. 1243. STRATEGIC ARMS REDUCTION TREATY
  It is the sense of the Senate that, pursuant to its constitutional
  responsibilities of advice and consent in respect to treaties, the Senate
  requests that before concluding a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
  the President provide--
  (1) a special classified and unclassified report to the Senate on whether
  the SS-23 INF missiles of Soviet manufacture, which the Soviets have
  confirmed have existed in the territories of East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
  and Bulgaria, constitute a violation of the INF Treaty or constitute
  deception in the INF negotiations, and whether the United States has
  reliable assurances that the missiles will be destroyed; and
  (2) a special classified and unclassified report to the Senate on whether
  the Soviet Krasnoyarsk radar, which Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze
  admitted is a clear violation of the ABM Treaty, has been verifiably
  dismantled in accordance with United States criteria.
SEC. 1244. THEATER DEFENSE PROGRAM
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The Director of Central Intelligence, William Webster, has testified
  before Congress that between 15 and 20 developing nations will possess
  ballistic missile capabilities by the end of the century.
  (2) The Director has also testified that by the year 2000, at least six
  third-world countries will have ballistic missiles with ranges of up to
  1,800 miles, and three of them may develop ballistic missiles with a range
  of 3,400 miles.
  (3) The Director has also testified `. . . that as many as 20 countries may
  be developing chemical weapons; and we expect this trend to continue despite
  ongoing multilateral efforts to stop their proliferation . . . At least
  10 countries are working to produce both previously known and futuristic
  biological weapons.'.
  (4) During the war between Iraq-Iran each used ballistic missiles and
  chemical payloads.
  (5) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has also informed Congress that,
  in addition to the five nuclear weapons countries--United States, Soviet
  Union, England, France, and China--`about half of a dozen additional
  countries have either acquired a capability to explode a nuclear device
  or are pursuing such a capability'.
  (6) DIA has also informed Congress that the proliferation of ballistic
  missiles is occurring at an ever-increasing pace. In just the last 2 years:
  (A) Over 1,000 ballistic missiles have been fired in combat in Iran, Iraq,
  and Afghanistan.
  (B) Flight tests of ballistic missiles have occurred in India, Pakistan,
  and South Africa.
  (C) Iraq has conducted an initial flight test of a space launch vehicle,
  which will enhance greatly their already extensive ballistic missile
  capability.
  (D) The longest range (1800+ mile) ballistic missiles in the Middle East
  have been supplied to Saudi Arabia by China.
  (7) The proliferation of ballastic missile, chemical weapons and nuclear
  technology poses a direct threat to many of our friends and allies. Moreover,
  U.S. contingency and projection forces are also threatened by these
  technologies, and this threat will increase in the future.
  (b) Therefore, it is the sense of the Congress that:
  (1) The proliferation to developing countries of ballistic missiles and
  chemical and nuclear weapons technology applicable to missile warhead
  development are potentially destabilizing, a threat to U.S. security
  commitments, and also pose a significant threat to the national security
  of our friends and allies around the the world.
  (2) Of the funds authorized for the Strategic Defense Initiative, up to
  $300,000,000 should be made available for the development of anti-tactical
  ballistic missile (ATBM) systems to counter such threats to U.S. forward
  deployed and projected forces. In this regard, the Congress recommends
  that the development of systems such as the Extended Range Interceptor
  and the Theater High Altitute Air Defense should be accelerated.
  (3) The SDI Organization should ensure that the Navy and Marine Corps are
  involved in developmental programs for future ATBM systems suitable for
  deployment with their projection and expeditionary forces.
  (4) Since the ARROW ATBM has been sucessful joint development program and,
  when deployed, will become an important asset for the defense of Israel
  against the threat of short range ballistic missiles in the region, the
  Secretary of Defense should negotiate, on an equitable basis, a memorandum
  of agreement to continue the program. Therefore, of the funds available
  for the Theater Defense program element in SDI program, not more than
  $50,000,000 should be made available for the ARROW program.
  (5) Of the funds authorized to the Army for Research, Development, Testing,
  and Evaluation, not more than $50,000,000 should be made available to
  conduct additional tests of the PATRIOT II system against existing types
  of ballistic missile threats.
  (6) The Army should establish a vigorous program to develop and test a
  rapidly deployable ATBM capability for U.S. units. For the near-term, the
  focus should be on the PATRIOT II system. From within these funds made
  available for PATRIOT II testing, the Army should also develop support
  systems, such as tracking and attack assessment radars, for existing and
  future ATBM systems.
SEC. 1245. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CLOSURE OF UNITED STATES MILITARY
INSTALLATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) It was reported in the July 28, 1990, European edition of the Stars
  and Stripes publication that General John R. Galvin, Commander-in-Chief
  of the United States European Command, has submitted to the Secretary of
  Defense a list of United States military installations located outside
  the United States that the General recommends be closed.
  (2) During consideration of legislative proposals authorizing appropriations
  for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1991 by the Committee on
  Armed Services of the Senate, General Galvin indicated he would announce a
  list of 100 United States military installations outside the United States
  he recommends for closure.
  (3) Many Members of Congress strongly believe that United States military
  installations outside the United States should be closed in lieu of closing
  military installations located in the United States.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- In light of the findings expressed in subsection
  (a), it is the sense of Congress that--
  (1) the Secretary of Defense should make public any recommendations made to
  the Secretary of Defense by General John R. Galvin regarding the closure
  of United States military installations outside the United States and
  any other recommendations submitted to the Secretary by other commanders
  of combatant commands regarding the closure of United States military
  installations outside the United States; and
  (2) the closure of such installations located outside the United States
  should be accomplished at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense at
  the earliest opportunity.
SEC. 1246. UNITED STATES FACILITIES IN GERMANY
  (a)(1) The Government of the United States has publicly committed itself
  to the reduction of the military forces which it deploys in Western Europe
  in general, and in the Federal Republic of Germany in particular.
  (2) The United States Army already is drawing up plans for the closure and
  realignment of United States military facilities in the Federal Republic
  of Germany.
  (3) Many United States military facilities in the Federal Republic of
  Germany are located on municipal property of high value.
  (4) The continuance of cordial relations between the peoples of the United
  States and Federal Republic of Germany is a matter of major concern, both
  for the health of United States-German relations and the strength of the
  North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
  (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the Department of Defense should,
  whenever possible, consult closely with the central, state, and municipal
  authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to closing those
  United States facilities located in municipal areas with high property
  values, particularly when those facilities could be developed for commercial
  or residential purposes.
SEC. 1247. PHILIPPINE EARTHQUAKE RELIEF EFFORT
  (a) FINDINGS- The Senate makes the following findings:
  (1) The men and women in the United States Air Force, Marine Corps, and
  Navy serving in the Pacific region have given substantial and significant
  assistance to the Government and people of the Philippines following the
  July 16 earthquake, which resulted in the deaths of over one thousand six
  hundred people, as well as severe dislocation and devastation.
  (2) United States military personnel stationed in the Philippines have
  traditionally exhibited a strong respect and admiration for the people of
  the Philippines.
  (3) A Marine Corps pilot was killed in a helicopter crash during an

  (6) Navy medical personnel from Subic Bay have provided critical medical
  assistance to those injured in the earthquake.
  (7) More than one thousand one hundred and forty tons of supplies and
  equipment have been airlifted to the Philippines or transported over land
  to Baguio City and Cabanatuan City, areas devastated by the earthquake.
  (8) Military civil engineering teams have restored more than half the
  damaged water systems and all of the electrical systems, and have provided
  heavy equipment to aid in rescue operations.
  (9) Six hundred and fifty units of blood were donated by members of Clark
  Air Force Base and other Pacific Air Force bases, and one hundred and
  twenty units of blood were donated by members of Subic Bay Naval Facility.
  (b) It is the sense of the Senate, that--
  (1) the earthquake relief assistance provided by United States military
  forces has played an essential role in the Philippine recovery from the
  July 16 earthquake; and
  (2) those United States Armed Forces and their dependents who have assisted
  in Philippine earthquake relief should be commended by the United States
  Senate for their considerable efforts on behalf of the Philippine people
  in their recovery efforts.
SEC. 1248.  COMMEMORATION OF THE EFFORTS OF THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE HISTORICAL
FOUNDATION
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The Battle of the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign of World War II, commonly
  known as the Battle of the Bulge, was fought in the Ardennes region of
  eastern Belgium and northern Luxembourg, from December 16, 1944, to January
  25, 1945, in the deepest snow and during the coldest temperatures in the

  fought in the Battle of the Bulge, making the battle the largest land
  battle ever fought by United States military forces.
  (3) The battle claimed 81,000 United States casualties, including 19,000
  killed.
  (4) In 1988, many of the veterans of the battle, including the 7,000 member
  organization known as the Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge, organized
  the Battle of the Bulge Historical Foundation to commemorate the heroic
  sacrifices made by the men and women who saw action during the Battle of
  the Bulge, to pay homage to the servicemen killed in that battle, and to
  inform the present and future youth of this Nation regarding the costs of
  war and the price of liberty.
  (5) The efforts of the foundation are directed toward expanding the existing
  United States Army Museum, located at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, to
  include a gallery dedicated to the battle, the participants of the battle,
  and World War II.
  (6) The Museum and the foundation have agreed to act jointly to achieve
  goals relating to the commemoration of that battle.
  (7) Installation of a gallery at the museum will result in the museum having
  the only gallery in the United States devoted exclusively to commemorating
  that battle.
  (8) The Battle of the Bulge Historical Foundation has set as a goal to

  North Africa, Sicily, Italy, the Normandy invasion, the Battle of the Bulge,
  and the crossing of the Rhine and Elbe Rivers.
  (3) in Korea, during the depths of the bitter winter of 1950, General
  Ridgway took command of the seriously demoralized Eighth Army, motivated
  and inspired it to `Stand and Fight,' and led it on the offensive again;
  (4) under his leadership, the military forces of the United Nations Command
  in Korea recaptured territory that had been lost earlier to overwhelming
  enemy forces and forced the onset of armistice negotiations; and

Part F--Missile Technology
SEC. 1271. SHORT TITLE
  This Part may be cited as the `Missile Technology Control Act of 1990'.
SEC. 1272. FINDINGS
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) the global spread of weapons of mass destruction, accompanied by
  the proliferation of sophisticated missile delivery systems and missile
  technology, poses a serious threat to stability and peace in many regions;
  (2) the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) was established in 1987
  to restrict such proliferation;
  (3) notwithstanding the existence of the MTCR, companies situated in
  countries which are adherents to the MTCR have transferred, in violation
  of the principles of that agreement, missile equipment and technology
  to nonadherents;
  (4) the MTCR is further weakened as it does not include the Soviet Union,
  China, Argentina, North Korea, Brazil, and other countries, which have
  transferred missiles and missile technology to countries without this
  capability;
  (5) missile proliferation could be better controlled if MTCR adherents
  shared a common interpretation of the MTCR principles and strictly enforced
  its provisions;
  (6) the spread of missiles can be effectively restricted only if all
  countries involved in the transfer of such missiles and technology agree
  to restrict such transfers;
  (7) coordination and cooperation between the agencies charged with
  responsibility for carrying out United States policy on missile control
  is essential; and
  (8) greater consultation between the President and the Congress is needed to
  ensure that Congress is being kept fully informed about missile proliferation
  and development, and ongoing measures to halt missile proliferation.
SEC. 1273. PURPOSE
  It is the purpose of this part--
  (1) to restrict the proliferation of missiles and missile equipment and
  technology;
  (2) to encourage greater international adherence to the Missile Technology
  Control Regime (MTCR) of 1987;
  (3) to strengthen the MTCR through increased cooperation among adherents
  to strengthen coordination of export controls;
  (4) to seek further bilateral and multilateral agreements which complement
  the MTCR;
  (5) to encourage countries without missiles to forego the development or
  acquisition of these weapons; and
  (6) to require stricter enforcement procedures and improved cooperation
  among the United States agencies responsible for controlling missile and
  missile technology exports.
SEC. 1274. AMENDMENT TO THE ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT
  The Arms Export Control Act is amended by inserting after chapter 6 (22
  U.S.C. 2795b. et seq.) the following new chapter:
`CHAPTER 7--CONTROL OF MISSILES AND MISSILE EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
`SEC. 71. POLICY
  `It is the policy of the United States to improve the control of and
  reduce the proliferation of missiles and missile equipment and technology
  by taking all appropriate measures--
  `(1) to improve enforcement and seek a common and broader interpretation
  among Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) members of MTCR principles;
  `(2) to increase the number of countries that adhere to the MTCR;
  `(3) to explore with nations that do not adhere to the MTCR and which
  export missiles and missile equipment and technology the negotiation of
  bilateral and multilateral agreements consistent with the principles of
  the MTCR or which, at a minimum, do not undercut the MTCR;
  `(4) to promote the international review of measures and development
  of common standards to reduce the proliferation of missiles and missile
  equipment and technology; and
  `(5) to seek binding multilateral agreements prohibiting the global spread
  of missiles that are subject to MTCR guidelines.
`SEC. 72. DENIAL OF THE TRANSFER OF MISSILE EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY BY
UNITED STATES PERSONS
  `(a) SANCTION- If the President determines that a United States person
  has transferred, or conspired to transfer or facilitated the transfer in

TITLE XIV--GUARD AND RESERVE INITIATIVE
Part A--Utilization of Reserve Components
SEC. 1401. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON GREATER UTILIZATION OF THE RESERVE
COMPONENTS OF THE ARMED FORCES
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The reserve components of the Armed Forces are an essential element
  of the national security establishment of the United States.
  (2) The overall reduction in the threat and the likelihood of continued
  fiscal constraints require the United States to increase utilization of
  the reserve components of the Armed Forces.
  (3) The Department of Defense has not adequately implemented the Total
  Force Policy since its inception in 1973.
  (4) The Department of Defense should shift a greater share of force structure
  and budgetary resources to the reserve components of the Armed Forces.
  (5) Expanding the reserve components is the most effective way to retain
  quality personnel as the force structure of the active components is
  reduced over the next five years.
  (6) The United States should recommit itself to the concept of the citizen
  soldier as a cornerstone of national defense policy for the future.
  (7) The President and the Secretary of Defense should take note of and

Part E--Miscellaneous
SEC. 1441. EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING UNITED STATES
ARMORED FORCES
  (a)(1) Since dramatic changes have occurred in the military situation
  in Europe;
  (2) Since the Warsaw Pact is no longer a credible military threat to NATO;
  (3) Since it appears that the heavy armored armies of both NATO and the
  Warsaw Pact will be substantially reduced by arms control agreements or
  unilateral actions;
  (4) Since the need for armor forces has not disappeared and many countries
  in the world possess large inventories of modern tanks;
  (5) Since the Soviet Union will still produce fourteen hundred new tanks
  in 1990;
  (6) Since with significantly increased warning times of enemy attack,
  greater reliance will be placed on United States Reserve Component Forces
  for armored heavy force reinforcement missions;
  (7) Since there is a need to enhance the capabilities of Reserve Component
  Armored Forces to assume increased responsibilities for armored heavy
  force reinforcement missions;
  (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--
  (1) the United States Army should take timely and necessary steps to
  enhance the capabilities of Reserve Component Armored Forces;
  (2) the United States Army Armor Center will remain the center for
  training, education, doctrine and combat development for United States
  Armored Forces--for both active and reserve components; and

  armored forces are adequately prepared for the increased reliance that
  will be placed on their greater role in armored heavy force reinforcement
  missions.
SEC. 1442. COMMENDATION OF THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES
  (a) The Senate finds that--
  (1) the birth of this Nation, the citizen-soldier of the United States
  has protected their fellow citizens from tyranny, invasion, violence,
  and natural disasters;
  (2) the revolution that threw off our yoke of colonialism, to assisting
  the Panamanians in their struggle over tyranny, the citizen-soldiers of
  the national guard and reserves, have fought in the defense of freedom;
  (3) as the resolve and sacrifice of our national guard and reserves over
  the last forty-five years gave them a lead role in our Nation's winning
  the cold war;
  (4) as we enter the final decade of this century with our Nation facing new
  and varied threats to peace, it is imperative that our guard and reserve
  be prepared to respond in a changing world;
  (5) as the national guard and reserves make up a large part of our Nation's
  combat and support units, their mobilization and training will remain
  vital to our national security;
  (6) as the outstanding Americans who serve in the national guard and
  reserves have maintained their level of excellence through their hard work
  and dedication to duty, our citizen soldiers have proved our Nation can
  continue to rely on them in any national emergency; and
  (7) the qualities that have given the national guard and reserves its
  venerable history, are still present today.
  (b) Therefore, the United States Senate acknowledge the valuable contribution
  that the men and women of our national guard and reserves have made to our
  Nation's security, and to continue to support their role as the foundation
  of our national defense in a changing world.

  facilities outside the United States.
  (2) The United States has also provided substantial resources over the
  years to the economic and military development of friendly foreign countries.
  (3) The provision of resources described in subparagraphs (1) and (2)
  was carried out pursuant to several collective security arrangements.
  (4) Efforts by the United States have enhanced the economic and military
  capabilities of a significant number of the friends and allies of the
  United States.
  (5) The recent changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the
  disintegration of the Warsaw Pact as a military alliance, have created an
  environment that will permit the withdrawal of military personnel of the
  United States from several military facilities in Europe and other areas
  of the world.
  (6) The United States is entitled to recoup the residual value of the
  facilities constructed or improved by it unilaterally or in conjunction
  with other governments.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- In light of the findings in subsection (a), it is
  the sense of the Congress that--
  (1) in the case of any military facility outside the United States released
  in whole or in part to a host country, the Secretary of Defense, acting
  through the military component commands or the sub-unified commands to the
  combatant commands, should be the lead official in negotiations relating
  to the residual value of such facility;
  (2) although environmental cleanup is a factor that should be considered in
  connection with the determination of residual value of a released facility,
  the cost to the United States, if any, of the environmental cleanup of a
  facility should not exceed the residual value of the facility;
  (3) determination of the residual value of military facilities released to
  host countries in whole or in part by the United States should be handled
  on a facility by facility basis; and
  (4) the Secretary of Defense should seek recompense based on the highest
  possible residual value of a facility released to a host nation.

TITLE XLI--NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY
SEC. 4101. SHORT TITLE
  This title may be cited as the `National Energy Security Act of 1990'.
SEC. 4102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) the United States is the leader of the free world and has world wide
  responsibilities to promote economic and political security;
  (2) the exercise of traditional responsibilities here and abroad in
  foreign policy requires that the United States be free of the risk of
  energy blackmail in times of shortages;
  (3) the level of the United States oil security is directly related to the
  level of domestic production of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas;
  (4) the ability of the United States to exercise its free will and to carry
  out its responsibilities as leader of the free world could be jeopardized
  by an excessive dependence on foreign oil imports;
  (5) increasing dependence on foreign oil imports has and continues to
  impose severe risks to the lives of United States service men and women
  and unacceptable costs to the national defense; and
  (6) an emergency national energy security plan should be developed and
  implemented to ensure that adequate supplies of energy shall be available
  at all times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile acts.
  (b) PURPOSE- The purpose of this title is to establish an emergency national
  energy security plan designed to reduce United States dependence on foreign
  oil supplies to a level which does not pose an unacceptable threat to the
  national security.
SEC. 4103. DUTIES OF THE PRESIDENT
  (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF CEILING- There is established a national oil import
  ceiling (referred to in this title as the `ceiling level') of foreign
  crude and oil product imports at 50 percent of United States consumption.
  (b) REPORT- (1) The President shall prepare and submit an annual report to
  Congress containing a national oil security projection which shall contain a
  forecast of domestic oil and natural gas liquid demand and production, and
  imports of crude and oil product for the subsequent year. The report shall
  indicate the likelihood of foreign crude and oil product imports exceeding
  the ceiling level during the next year and the actions which the President
  will take to maintain crude and oil product imports below the ceiling level.
  (2) At the time of the budget transmitted under section 1105(a) of title
  31, United States Code, by the President to the Congress, the projection
  prepared pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be presented to Congress with a
  description of the actions which the President would take under section 4104.
SEC. 4104. NATIONAL ENERGY PRODUCTION AND SECURITY ACTION PLAN
  (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF ACTION PLAN- The President shall at all times monitor
  the level of foreign crude and oil product imports as a share of United
  States oil consumption. Upon a finding that the ceiling level has been
  exceeded for any six months within any continuous twelve month period,
  the President shall within 30 days submit an Energy Production and Security
  Action Plan (referred to in this title as the `Action Plan') to the Speaker
  of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. The Action
  Plan shall indicate specific actions to be taken to reduce crude and product
  imports below the ceiling level. Notwithstanding any other provision of
  law, the Action Plan shall be immediately implemented by the President upon
  enactment of a joint resolution by the Congress approving the Action Plan.
  (b) ACTION PLAN- The Energy Production and Security Action Plan shall
  include but not be limited to--
  (1) a certification by the President that the ceiling level has been
  exceeded;
  (2) a list of Federal land tracts, offshore and onshore, in order of their
  potential for oil and gas discovery, including any Federal land outside units
  of the National Park System, currently off-limits to oil and gas leasing;
  (3) a schedule for leasing the tracts identified in subparagraph (B) in
  order of their potential for oil and gas discovery, including number of
  tracts to be leased and the timing for individual lease sales;
  (4) energy conservation actions including improved fuel efficiency for
  automobiles and the development and utilization of alternative transportation
  fuels; and
  (5) production incentives for domestic oil and gas including recommendations
  on the imposition of oil import fees, royalty reductions, tax and other
  incentives for stripper well production and the production of offshore,
  frontier, and other oil produced with tertiary recovery techniques.
Passed the Senate August 4, 1990.
