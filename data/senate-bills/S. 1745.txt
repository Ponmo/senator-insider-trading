    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The worldwide proliferation of ballistic missiles is a 
        potential threat to the United States national interests 
        overseas and challenges United States defense planning.
            (2) In the absence of a national missile defense, the 
        United States remains vulnerable to long-range missile threats.
            (3) Russia has a ground-based missile defense system 
        deployed around Moscow.
            (4) Several countries, including Iraq, Iran, and North 
        Korea may soon be technologically capable of threatening the 
        United States and Russia with ballistic missile attack.

days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Content of Report.--The report shall contain the following:
            (1) A list of all countries thought to have nuclear, 
        chemical, or biological weapons, the estimated numbers of such 
        weapons that each country has, and the destructive potential of 
        the weapons.
            (2) A list of all countries thought to have ballistic 
        missiles, the estimated number of such missiles that each 
        country has, and an assessment of the ability of those 
        countries to integrate their ballistic missile capabilities 
        with their nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons 
        technologies.
            (3) A comparison of the United States civil defense 
        capabilities with the civil defense capabilities of each 
        country that has nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and 
        ballistic missiles capable of delivering such weapons.
            (4) An estimate of the number of American fatalities and 
        injuries that could result, and an estimate of the value of 
        property that could be lost, from an attack on the United 
        States by ballistic missiles carrying nuclear, chemical, or 
        biological weapons if the United States were left undefended by 
        a national missile defense system covering all 50 States.
            (5) Assuming the use of any existing theater ballistic 
        missile defense system for defense of the United States, a list 
        of the States that would be left exposed to nuclear ballistic 
        missile attacks and the criteria used to determine which States 
        would be left exposed.
            (6) The means by which the United States is preparing to 
        defend itself against the potential threat of ballistic missile 
        attacks by North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and other countries 
        obtaining ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear, 
        chemical, and biological weapons in the near future.
            (7) For each country that is capable of attacking the 
        United States with ballistic missiles carrying a nuclear, 
        biological, or chemical weapon, a comparison of--
                    (A) the vulnerability of the United States to such 
                an attack if theater missile defenses were used to 
                defend against the attack; and
                    (B) the vulnerability of the United States to such

        importance to the United States.
            (3) The United States has played a military role in the 
        Middle East, most recently in the Persian Gulf War, and may 
        likely be called upon again to deter aggression in the region.
            (4) United States troops have used desalting technologies 
        to guarantee the availability of fresh water in past 
        deployments in the Middle East.
            (5) Adequate, efficient, and cheap access to high-quality 
        fresh water will be vital to maintaining the readiness and 
        sustainability of United States troops, and those of our

enrollee unless the disenrollment is agreed to by the Secretary and the 
designated provider.
    (d) Additional Enrollment Authority.--Other covered beneficiaries 
may also receive health care services from a designated provider, 
except that the designated provider may market such services to, and 
enroll, only those covered beneficiaries who--
            (1) do not have other primary health insurance coverage 
        (other than medicare coverage) covering basic primary care and

beneficiary who desires to enroll in the managed care program of a 
designated provider is also entitled to hospital insurance benefits

et seq.), the covered beneficiary shall elect whether to receive health 
care services as an enrollee or under part A of title XVIII of the

for health care that the private facility or provider provides to 
enrollees of a designated provider.
    (b) Authorized Adjustments.--The payment rules imposed under 
subsection (a) shall be subject to such modifications as the Secretary 
considers appropriate. The Secretary may authorize a lower rate than 
the maximum rate that would otherwise apply under subsection (a) if the 
lower rate is agreed to by the designated provider and the private 
facility or health care provider.
    (c) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to 
implement this section after consultation with the other administering

a designated provider shall be full risk capitation. The capitation 
payments shall be negotiated and agreed upon by the Secretary and the 
designated provider. In addition to such other factors as the parties 
may agree to apply, the capitation payments shall be based on the 
utilization experience of enrollees and competitive market rates for 
equivalent health care services for a comparable population to such 
enrollees in the area in which the designated provider is located.
    (b) Limitation on Total Payments.--Total capitation payments to a 
designated provider shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost that

received their care through a military treatment facility, the TRICARE 
program, or the medicare program, as the case may be.
    (c) Establishment of Payment Rates on Annual Basis.--The Secretary 
and a designated provider shall establish capitation payments on an 
annual basis, subject to periodic review for actuarial soundness and to 
adjustment for any adverse or favorable selection reasonably 
anticipated to result from the design of the program.
    (d) Alternative Basis for Calculating Payments.--After September 
30, 1999, the Secretary and a designated provider may mutually agree

        disproportionately high or low share of threats, mission 
        requirements, land or ocean area, number of countries, or 
        population.
            (3) The other factors used to establish the current Areas 
        of Responsibility.

                    (A) a total of five or fewer commands, all of which 
                are regional;

        combatant commands with respect to contingency planning for 
        that area and its periphery.
            (9) Whether the current geographic boundary between the 
        Central Command and the European Command through the Middle 
        East could create command conflicts in the context of fighting 
        a major regional conflict in the Middle East.

SEC. 908. ACTIONS TO LIMIT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL 
              MISSILE DEFENSE JOINT PROGRAM OFFICE ON PRIVATE SECTOR 
              EMPLOYMENT.

    The Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization shall 
take such actions as are necessary in connection with the establishment 
of the National Missile Defense Joint Program Office to ensure that the 
establishment of that office does not make it necessary for a Federal 
Government contractor to reduce the number of persons employed by the 
contractor for supporting the national missile defense development 
program at any particular location outside the National Capital Region 
(as defined in section 2674(f)(2) of title 10, United States Code).

            Subtitle B--National Imagery and Mapping Agency

SEC. 911. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency Act of 1996''.

SEC. 912. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There is a need within the Department of Defense and 
        the Intelligence Community of the United States to provide a 
        single agency focus for the growing number and diverse types of 
        customers for imagery and geospatial information resources 
        within the Government, to ensure visibility and accountability 
        for those resources, and to harness, leverage, and focus rapid 
        technological developments to serve the imagery, imagery 
        intelligence, and geospatial information customers.
            (2) There is a need for a single Government agency to 
        solicit and advocate the needs of that growing and diverse pool 
        of customers.
            (3) A single combat support agency dedicated to imagery, 
        imagery intelligence, and geospatial information could act as a 
        focal point for support of all imagery intelligence and 
        geospatial information customers, including customers in the 
        Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and related 
        agencies outside of the Department of Defense.
            (4) Such an agency would best serve the needs of the 
        imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information 
        customers if it were organized--
                    (A) to carry out its mission responsibilities under 
                the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary 
                of Defense, with the advice of the Chairman of the 
                Joint Chiefs of Staff; and
                    (B) to carry out its responsibilities to national 
                intelligence customers in accordance with policies and 
                priorities established by the Director of Central 
                Intelligence.

              CONTRACTS FOR PHASED MAINTENANCE OF AE CLASS SHIPS.

    Section 1016 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 425) is repealed.

SEC. 1024. CONTRACT OPTIONS FOR LMSR VESSELS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress reaffirms the findings set forth in section 
1013(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 
(Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 422), and makes the following 
modifications and supplemental findings:
            (1) Since the findings set forth in section 1013(a) of such 
        Act were originally formulated, the Secretary of the Navy has 
        exercised options for the acquisition of two of the six 
        additional large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels 
        that may be acquired by exercise of options provided for under 
        contracts covering the acquisition of a total of 17 LMSR 
        vessels.
            (2) Therefore, under those contracts, the Secretary has 
        placed orders for the acquisition of 13 LMSR vessels and has 
        remaining options for the acquisition of four more LMSR 
        vessels, all of which would be new construction vessels.
            (3) The remaining options allow the Secretary to place 
        orders for one vessel to be constructed at each of two 
        shipyards for award before December 31, 1996, and December 31, 
        1997, respectively.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress also reaffirms its declaration of 
the sense of Congress, as set forth in section 1013(b) of Public Law 
104-106, that the Secretary of the Navy should plan for, and budget to 
provide for, the acquisition as soon as possible of a total of 19 
large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels (the number 
determined to be required in the report entitled ``Mobility 
Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update'', submitted by the 
Secretary of Defense to Congress in April 1995), rather than only 17 
such vessels (which is the number of vessels under contract as of April 
1996).
    (c) Additional New Construction Contract Option.--The Secretary of 
the Navy should negotiate with each of the two shipyards holding new 
construction contracts referred to in subsection (a)(1) (Department of 
the Navy contracts numbered N00024-93-C-2203 and N00024-93-C-2205) for 
an option under each such contract for construction of one additional 
such LMSR vessel, with such option to be available to the Secretary for 
exercise not earlier than fiscal year 1998, subject to the availability 
of funds authorized and appropriated for such purpose. Nothing in this 
subsection shall be construed to preclude the Secretary of the Navy 
from competing the award of the two options between the two shipyards 
holding new construction contracts referred to in subsection (a)(1).
    (d) Report.--The Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees, by March 31, 1997, a report stating 
the intentions of the Secretary regarding the acquisition of options 
for the construction of two additional LMSR vessels as described in 
subsection (c).
    (e) Repeal of Superseded Provision.--Section 1013 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106; 110 
Stat 422) is amended by striking out subsection (c).

SEC. 1025. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING USS LCS 102 (LSSL 102).

    It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense should 
use existing authorities in law to seek the expeditious return, upon 
completion of service, of the former USS LCS 102 (LSSL 102) from the 
Government of Thailand in order for the ship to be transferred to the 
United States Shipbuilding Museum in Quincy, Massachusetts.

    (d) Funding.--Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated for 
fiscal year 1997 for the Department of Defense for drug interdiction

section.
    (e) Limitations.--(1) The Secretary may not obligate or expend

                will be used only by the officials and employees 
                referred to in subparagraph (B);
                    (ii) none of the equipment or materiel will be

                or entity not authorized by the United States to 
                receive the equipment or materiel; and
                    (iii) the equipment and materiel will be used only 
                for the purposes intended by the United States 
                Government.
            (D) That the Government of Mexico has implemented, to the

            (E) That the departments, agencies, and instrumentalities

        materiel.
            (G) That the Government of Mexico will permit continuous

        the use of the equipment and materiel provided as support under 
        terms and conditions similar to the terms and conditions

SEC. 1045. DEFENSE BURDENSHARING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States continues to spend billions of 
        dollars to promote regional security and to make preparations 
        for regional contingencies.
            (2) United States defense expenditures promote United 
        States national security interests; however, they also 
        significantly contribute to the defense of our allies.
            (3) In 1993, the gross domestic product of the United 
        States equaled $6,300,000,000,000, while the gross domestic 
        product of other NATO member countries totaled 
        $7,200,000,000,000.
            (4) Over the course of 1993, the United States spent 4.7 
        percent of its gross domestic product on defense, while other 
        NATO members collectively spent 2.5 percent of their gross 
        domestic product on defense.
            (5) In addition to military spending, foreign assistance 
        plays a vital role in the establishment and maintenance of 
        stability in other nations and in implementing the United 
        States national security strategy.
            (6) This assistance has often prevented the outbreak of 
        conflicts which otherwise would have required costly military 
        interventions by the United States and our allies.
            (7) From 1990-1993, the United States spent $59,000,000,000 
        in foreign assistance, a sum which represents an amount greater 
        than any other nation in the world.
            (8) In 1995, the United States spent over $10,000,000,000 
        to promote European security, while European NATO nations only 
        contributed $2,000,000,000 toward this effort.
            (9) With a smaller gross domestic product and a larger 
        defense budget than its European NATO allies, the United States 
        shoulders an unfair share of the burden of the common defense.
            (10) Japan now pays over 75 percent of the nonpersonnel 
        costs incurred by United States military forces permanently 
        assigned there, while our European allies pay for less than 25 
        percent of these same costs. Japan signed a new Special 
        Measures Agreement this year which will increase Japan's 
        contribution toward the cost of stationing United States troops 
        in Japan by approximately $30,000,000 a year over the next five 
        years.
            (11) These increased contributions help to rectify the 
        imbalance in the burden shouldered by the United States for the 
        common defense.
            (12) The relative share of the burden of the common defense 
        still falls too heavily on the United States, and our allies 
        should dedicate more of their own resources to defending 
        themselves.
    (b) Efforts To Increase Allied Burdensharing.--The President shall 
seek to have each nation that has cooperative military relations with 
the United States (including security agreements, basing arrangements, 
or mutual participation in multinational military organizations or 
operations) take one or more of the following actions:
            (1) Increase its financial contributions to the payment of 
        the nonpersonnel costs incurred by the United States Government 
        for stationing United States military personnel in that nation, 
        with a goal of achieving the following percentages of such 
        costs:
                    (A) By September 30, 1997, 37.5 percent.

SEC. 1046. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING EXPORT CONTROLS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Export controls are a part of a comprehensive response 
        to national security threats. United States exports should be 
        restricted where those threats exist to national security, 
        nonproliferation, and foreign policy interests of the United 
        States.
            (2) The export of certain commodities and technology may 
        adversely affect the national security and foreign policy of 
        the United States by making a significant contribution to the 
        military potential of individual countries or by disseminating 
        the capability to design, develop, test, produce, stockpile, or 
        use weapons of mass destruction, missile delivery systems, and 
        other significant military capabilities. Therefore, the 
        administration of export controls should emphasize the control 
        of these exports.
            (3) The acquisition of sensitive commodities and 
        technologies by those countries and end users whose actions or 
        policies run counter to United States national security or 
        foreign policy interests may enhance the military capabilities 
        of those countries, particularly their ability to design, 
        develop, test, produce, stockpile, use, and deliver nuclear, 
        chemical, and biological weapons, missile delivery systems, and 
        other significant military capabilities. This enhancement 
        threatens the security of the United States and its allies. The 
        availability to countries and end users of items that 
        contribute to military capabilities or the proliferation of 
        weapons of mass destruction is a fundamental concern of the 
        United States and should be eliminated through deterrence, 
        negotiations, and other appropriate means whenever possible.
            (4) The national security of the United States depends not 
        only on wise foreign policies and a strong defense, but also a 
        vibrant national economy. To be truly effective, export 
        controls should be applied uniformly by all suppliers.
            (5) On November 5, 1995, President William J. Clinton 
        extended Executive Order No. 12938 regarding ``Weapons of Mass 
        Destruction'', and ``declared a national emergency with respect 
        to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
        security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
        posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
        weapons and the means of delivering such weapons''.
            (6) A successor regime to COCOM (the Coordinating 
        Commission on Multilateral Controls) has not been established. 
        Currently, each nation is determining independently which dual-
        use military items, if any, will be controlled for export.
            (7) The United States should play a leading role in 
        promoting transparency and responsibility with regard to the 
        transfers of sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) establishing an international export control regime, 
        empowered to control exports of dual-use technology, is 
        critically important and should become a top priority for the 
        United States; and
            (2) the United States should strongly encourage its allies 
        and friends to--
                    (A) adopt a commodity control list which governs 
                the same or similar items as are controlled by the 
                United States Commodity Control list;
                    (B) strengthen enforcement activities; and
                    (C) explore the use of unilateral export controls 
                where the possibility exists that an export could 
                contribute to proliferation.

        it affects the preparedness of Central and Eastern European 
        nations for the responsibilities of NATO membership, including 
        civilian control of the military, the rule of law, human 
        rights, and parliamentary oversight.
            (7) The state of relations between prospective NATO members 
        and their neighbors, steps taken by prospective members to 
        reduce tensions, and mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of 
        border disputes.
            (8) The commitment of prospective NATO members to the 
        principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and the security of the 
        North Atlantic area.
            (9) The effect of NATO enlargement on the political, 
        economic, and security conditions of European Partnership for 
        Peace nations not among the first new NATO members.
            (10) The relationship between NATO enlargement and EU 
        enlargement and the costs and benefits of both.
            (11) The relationship between NATO enlargement and treaties 
        relevant to United States and European security, such as the 
        Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty.
            (12) The anticipated impact both of NATO enlargement and 
        further delays of NATO enlargement on Russian foreign and 
        defense policies and the costs and benefits of a security 
        relationship between NATO and Russia.

SEC. 1072. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES-JAPAN 
              SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE AGREEMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States and Japan share a long and important 
        bilateral relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and 
        stability in the Asia Pacific region, an alliance which was 
        reaffirmed at the recent summit meeting between President 
        Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.
            (2) The Japanese economy has experienced difficulty over 
        the past few years, demonstrating that it is no longer possible 
        for Japan, the world's second largest economy, to use exports 
        as the sole engine of economic growth, but that the Government 
        of Japan must promote deregulation of its domestic economy in 
        order to increase economic growth.
            (3) Deregulation of the Japanese economy requires 
        government attention to the removal of barriers to imports of 
        manufactured goods.
            (4) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement 
        has begun the process of deregulation in the semiconductor 
        sector and is opening the Japanese market to competitive 
        foreign products.
            (5) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement 
        has put in place both government-to-government and industry-to-
        industry mechanisms which have played a vital role in allowing 
        cooperation to replace conflict in this important high 
        technology sector.
            (6) The mechanisms include joint calculation of foreign 
        market share, deterrence of dumping, and promotion of 
        industrial cooperation in the design of foreign semiconductor 
        devices.
            (7) Because of these actions under the United States-Japan 
        Semiconductor Trade Agreement, the United States and Japan 
        today enjoy trade in semiconductors which is mutually 
        beneficial, harmonious, and free from the friction that once 
        characterized the semiconductor industry.
            (8) Because of structural barriers in Japan, a gap still 
        remains between the share of the world market for semiconductor 
        products outside Japan that the United States and other foreign 
        semiconductor sources are able to capture through 
        competitiveness and the share of the Japanese semiconductor 
        market that the United States and those other sources are able 
        to capture through competitiveness, and that gap is consistent 
        across the full range of semiconductor products as well as a 
        full range of end-use applications.
            (9) The competitiveness and health of the United States 
        semiconductor industry is of critical importance to the overall 
        economic well-being and high technology defense capabilities of 
        the United States.
            (10) The economic interests of both the United States and 
        Japan are best served by well functioning, open markets, 
        deterrence of dumping, and continuing good cooperative 
        relationships in all sectors, including semiconductors.
            (11) A strong and healthy and military and political 
        alliance between the United States and Japan requires 
        continuation of the industrial and economic cooperation 
        promoted by the United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade 
        Agreement.
            (12) President Clinton has called on the Government of 
        Japan to agree to a continuation of a United States-Japan 
        Semiconductor Trade Agreement beyond the current agreement's 
        expiration on July 31, 1996.
            (13) The Government of Japan has opposed any continuation 
        of a government-to-government agreement to promote cooperation 
        in United States-Japan semiconductor trade.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) it is regrettable that the Government of Japan has 
        refused to consider continuation of a government-to-government 
        agreement to ensure that cooperation continues in the 
        semiconductor sector beyond the expiration of the Semiconductor 
        Trade Agreement on July 31, 1996; and
            (2) the President should take all necessary and appropriate 
        actions to ensure the continuation of a government-to-
        government United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement 
        before the current agreement expires on that date.
    (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``United States-
Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement'' refers to the agreement between 
the United States and Japan concerning trade in semiconductor products, 
with arrangement, done by exchange of letters at Washington on June 11, 
1991.

SEC. 1077. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHARING OF 
              EXPERIENCES UNDER MILITARY YOUTH PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Programs of the Department of Defense for youth who are 
        dependents of members of the Armed Forces have not received the 
        same level of attention and resources as have child care 
        programs of the Department since the passage of the Military 
        Child Care Act of 1989 (title XV of Public Law 101-189; 10 
        U.S.C. 113 note).
            (2) Older children deserve as much attention to their 
        developmental needs as do younger children.
            (3) The Department has started to direct more attention to 
        programs for youths who are dependents of members of the Armed 
        Forces by funding the implementation of 20 model community 
        programs to address the needs of such youths.
            (4) The lessons learned from such programs could apply to 
        civilian youth programs as well.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Department of Defense, Federal, State, and local 
        agencies, and businesses and communities involved in conducting 
        youth programs could benefit from the development of 
        partnerships to foster an exchange of ideas, information, and 
        materials relating to such programs and to encourage closer 
        relationships between military installations and the 
        communities that support them;
            (2) such partnerships could benefit all families by helping 
        the providers of services for youths exchange ideas about 
        innovative ways to address barriers to the effective provision 
        of such services; and
            (3) there are many ways that such partnerships could be 
        developed, including--
                    (A) cooperation between the Department and Federal 
                and State educational agencies in exploring the use of 
                public school facilities for child care programs and 
                youth programs that are mutually beneficial to the 
                Department and civilian communities and complement 
                programs of the Department carried out at its 
                facilities; and
                    (B) improving youth programs that enable 
                adolescents to relate to new peer groups when families 
                of members of the Armed Forces are relocated.
    (c) Report.--Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to Congress a report on the status of any initiatives 
undertaken this section, including recommendations for additional ways 
to improve the youth programs of the Department of Defense and to 
improve such programs so as to benefit communities in the vicinity of 
military installations.

SEC. 1078. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHARING OF 
              EXPERIENCES WITH MILITARY CHILD CARE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense should be congratulated on 
        the successful implementation of the Military Child Care Act of 
        1989 (title XV of Public Law 101-189; 10 U.S.C. 113 note).
            (2) The actions taken by the Department as a result of that 
        Act have dramatically improved the availability, affordability, 
        quality, and consistency of the child care services provided to 
        members of the Armed Forces.
            (3) Child care is important to the readiness of members of 
        the Armed Forces because single parents and couples in military 
        service must have access to affordable child care of good 
        quality if they are to perform their jobs and respond 
        effectively to long work hours or deployments.
            (4) Child care is important to the retention of members of 
        the Armed Forces in military service because the 
        dissatisfaction of the families of such members with military 
        life is a primary reason for the departure of such members from 
        military service.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the civilian and military child care communities, 
        Federal, State, and local agencies, and businesses and 
        communities involved in the provision of child care services 
        could benefit from the development of partnerships to foster an 
        exchange of ideas, information, and materials relating to their 
        experiences with the provision of such services and to 
        encourage closer relationships between military installations 
        and the communities that support them;
            (2) such partnerships would be beneficial to all families 
        by helping providers of child care services exchange ideas 
        about innovative ways to address barriers to the effective 
        provision of such services; and
            (3) there are many ways that these partnerships can be 
        developed, including--
                    (A) cooperation between the directors and 
                curriculum specialists of military child development 
                centers and civilian child development centers in 
                assisting such centers in the accreditation process;
                    (B) use of family support staff to conduct parent 
                and family workshops for new parents and parents with 
                young children in family housing on military 
                installations and in communities in the vicinity of 
                such installations;
                    (C) internships in Department of Defense child care 
                programs for civilian child care providers to broaden 
                the base of good-quality child care services in 
                communities in the vicinity of military installations; 
                and
                    (D) attendance by civilian child care providers at 
                Department child-care training classes on a space-
                available basis.
    (c) Report.--Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to Congress a report on the status of any initiatives 
undertaken this section, including recommendations for additional ways 
to improve the child care programs of the Department of Defense and to 
improve such programs so as to benefit civilian child care providers in 
communities in the vicinity of military installations.

                under chapter 28 or 29 of title 35, United States

          Subtitle G--Review of Armed Forces Force Structures

SEC. 1091. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Armed Forces Force Structures 
Review Act of 1996''.

SEC. 1092. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the 
        United States has conducted two substantial assessments of the 
        force structure of the Armed Forces necessary to meet United 
        States defense requirements.
            (2) The assessment by the Bush Administration (known as the 
        ``Base Force'' assessment) and the assessment by the Clinton 
        Administration (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were 
        intended to reassess the force structure of the Armed Forces in 
        light of the changing realities of the post-Cold War world.
            (3) Both assessments served an important purpose in 
        focusing attention on the need to reevaluate the military 
        posture of the United States, but the pace of global change 
        necessitates a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense 
        strategy of the United States and the force structure of the 
        Armed Forces required to meet the threats to the United States 
        in the 21st century.
            (4) The Bottom-Up Review has been criticized on several 
        points, including--
                    (A) the assumptions underlying the strategy of 
                planning to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major 
                regional conflicts;
                    (B) the force levels recommended to carry out that 
                strategy; and
                    (C) the funding proposed for such recommended force 
                levels.
            (5) In response to the recommendations of the Commission on 
        Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of 
        Defense endorsed the concept of conducting a quadrennial review 
        of the defense program at the beginning of each newly elected 
        Presidential administration, and the Secretary intends to 
        complete the first such review in 1997.
            (6) The review is to involve a comprehensive examination of 
        defense strategy, the force structure of the active, guard, and 
        reserve components, force modernization plans, infrastructure, 
        and other elements of the defense program and policies in order 
        to determine and express the defense strategy of the United 
        States and to establish a revised defense program through the 
        year 2005.
            (7) In order to ensure that the force structure of the 
        Armed Forces is adequate to meet the challenges to the national 
        security interests of the United States in the 21st century, to 
        assist the Secretary of Defense in conducting the review 
        referred to in paragraph (5), and to assess the appropriate 
        force structure of the Armed Forces through the year 2010 and 
        beyond (if practicable), it is important to provide for the 
        conduct of an independent, non-partisan review of the force 
        structure that is more comprehensive than prior assessments of 
        the force structure, extends beyond the quadrennial defense 
        review, and explores innovative and forward-thinking ways of 
        meeting such challenges.

SEC. 1093. QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW.

    (a) Requirement in 1997.--The Secretary of Defense, in consultation 
with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall complete in 1997 
a review of the defense program of the United States intended to 
satisfy the requirements for a Quadrennial Defense Review as identified 
in the recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions of the 
Armed Forces. The review shall include a comprehensive examination of 
the defense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, 
infrastructure, and other elements of the defense program and policies 
with a view toward determining and expressing the defense strategy of 
the United States and establishing a revised defense program through 
the year 2005.
    (b) Involvement of National Defense Panel.--(1) The Secretary shall 
apprise the National Defense Panel established under section 1084, on 
an on-going basis, of the work undertaken in the conduct of the review.
    (2) Not later than March 14, 1997, the Chairman of the National 
Defense Panel shall submit to the Secretary the Panel's assessment of 
work undertaken in the conduct of the review as of that date and shall 
include in the assessment the recommendations of the Panel for 
improvements to the review, including recommendations for additional 
matters to be covered in the review.
    (c) Assessments of Review.--Upon completion of the review, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman of the National 
Defense Panel shall each prepare and submit to the Secretary such 
chairman's assessment of the review in time for the inclusion of the 
assessment in its entirety in the report under subsection (d).
    (d) Report.--Not later than May 15, 1997, the Secretary shall 
submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a 
comprehensive report on the review. The report shall include the 
following:
            (1) The results of the review, including a comprehensive 
        discussion of the defense strategy of the United States and the 
        force structure best suited to implement the strategy.
            (2) The threats examined for purposes of the review and the 
        scenarios developed in the examination of such threats.
            (3) The assumptions used in the review, including 
        assumptions relating to the cooperation of allies and mission-
        sharing, levels of acceptable risk, warning times, and 
        intensity and duration of conflict.
            (4) The effect on the force structure of preparations for 
        and participation in peace operations and military operations 
        other than war.
            (5) The effect on the force structure of the utilization by 
        the Armed Forces of technologies anticipated to be available by 
        the year 2005, including precision guided munitions, stealth, 
        night vision, digitization, and communications, and the changes 
        in doctrine and operational concepts that would result from the 
        utilization of such technologies.
            (6) The manpower and sustainment policies required under 
        the defense strategy to support engagement in conflicts lasting 
        more than 120 days.
            (7) The anticipated roles and missions of the reserve 
        components in the defense strategy and the strength, 
        capabilities, and equipment necessary to assure that the 
        reserve components can capably discharge such roles and 
        missions.
            (8) The appropriate ratio of combat forces to support 
        forces (commonly referred to as the ``tooth-to-tail'' ratio) 
        under the defense strategy, including, in particular, the 
        appropriate number and size of headquarter units and Defense 
        Agencies for that purpose.
            (9) The air-lift and sea-lift capabilities required to 
        support the defense strategy.
            (10) The forward presence, pre-positioning, and other 
        anticipatory deployments necessary under the defense strategy 
        for conflict deterrence and adequate military response to 
        anticipated conflicts.
            (11) The extent to which resources must be shifted among 
        two or more theaters under the defense strategy in the event of 
        conflict in such theaters.
            (12) The advisability of revisions to the Unified Command 
        Plan as a result of the defense strategy.

submit to the Secretary an independent assessment of a variety of 
possible force structures of the Armed Forces through the year 2010 and 
beyond, including the force structure identified in the report on the 
review under section 1083(d). The purpose of the assessment is to 
develop proposals for an ``above the line'' force structure of the 
Armed Forces and to provide the Secretary and Congress recommendations 
regarding the optimal force structure to meet anticipated threats to 
the national security of the United States through the time covered by 
the assessment.
    (2) In conducting the assessment, the Panel shall examine a variety 
of potential threats (including near-term threats and long-term

including the following:
            (A) Conventional threats across a spectrum of conflicts.
            (B) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and

        conflict described in the Bottom-Up Review to a conflict of 
        greater magnitude than the conflict so described.
    (4) As part of the assessment, the Panel shall also--
            (A) develop recommendations regarding a variety of force 
        structures for the Armed Forces that permit the forward

        TITLE XIII--DEFENSE AGAINST WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

SEC. 1301. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Defense Against Weapons of Mass 
Destruction Act of 1996''.

SEC. 1302. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and 
        technologies are increasingly available from worldwide sources. 
        Technical information relating to such weapons is readily 
        available on the Internet, and raw materials for chemical, 
        biological, and radiological weapons are widely available for 
        legitimate commercial purposes.
            (2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast 
        array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass 
        destruction.
            (3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain 
        the facilities, materials, and technologies capable of 
        producing additional quantities of weapons of mass destruction.
            (4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was 
        accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems, 
        deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related 
        materials and technologies, economic hardships, and significant 
        gaps in border control among the states of the former Soviet 
        Union. The problems of organized crime and corruption in the 
        states of the former Soviet Union increase the potential for 
        proliferation of nuclear, radiological, biological, and 
        chemical weapons and related materials.
            (5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have 
        substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile 
        nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons 
        of mass destruction and related materials and technologies from 
        within the states of the former Soviet Union and from 
        unemployed scientists who worked on those programs.
            (6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of 
        potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire 
        nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is 
        greater than any time in history.
            (7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, 
        and Libya as hostile states which already possess some weapons 
        of mass destruction and are developing others.
            (8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons 
        of mass destruction is well within the capability of many 
        extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or as 
        proxies for foreign states.
            (9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid 
        extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with plausible 
        deniability.
            (10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical 
        attacks against civilian targets in the United States and 
        Japan, and a radiological attack in Russia.
            (11) The potential for the national security of the United 
        States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, or 
        biological terrorism must be taken as seriously as the risk of 
        an attack by long-range ballistic missiles carrying nuclear 
        weapons.
            (12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by 
        weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military 
        targets in the usual sense of the term.
            (13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the 
        United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and 
        chemical weapons delivered by unconventional means is 
        significant and growing.
            (14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents 
        involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical 
        materials, even if such materials are not configured as 
        military weapons.
            (15) Facilities required for production of radiological, 
        biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder to 
        detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological, and 
        chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery means 
        that are much harder to detect than long-range ballistic 
        missiles.
            (16) Such delivery systems have no assignment of 
        responsibility, unlike ballistic missiles, for which a launch 
        location would be unambiguously known.
            (17) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear, 
        radiological, biological, and chemical weapons, which might be 
        preferable to foreign states and nonstate organizations, 
        include cargo ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and private 
        vehicles and vessels, and commercial cargo shipments routed 
        through multiple destinations.
            (18) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state 
        efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons 
        production programs, but are ineffective in monitoring and 
        controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous, 
        unconventional proliferation efforts.
            (19) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do 
        little to detect or prevent the rapid development of a 
        capability to suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical or 
        biological weapons with nothing but commercial supplies and 
        equipment.
            (20) The United States lacks adequate planning and 
        countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, radiological, 
        biological, and chemical terrorism.
            (21) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear 
        Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear 
        or radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to 
        deal with emergencies involving biological, or chemical weapons 
        or related materials.
            (22) State and local emergency response personnel are not 
        adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving nuclear, 
        radiological, biological, or chemical materials.
            (23) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to 
        nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have 
        revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe 
        problems of coordination.
            (24) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities 
        for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological, 
        biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States requires 
        well-coordinated participation of many Federal agencies, and 
        careful planning by the Federal Government and State and local 
        governments.
            (25) Training and exercises can significantly improve the 
        preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel 
        for emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or 
        chemical weapons or related materials.
            (26) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the 
        Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided 
        assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in 
        neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive ordnance, 
        as well as radiological, biological, and chemical materials, 
        can be a vital contribution to the development and deployment 
        of countermeasures against nuclear, biological, and chemical 
        weapons of mass destruction.
            (27) The United States lacks effective policy coordination 
        regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of 
        mass destruction.

the stockpile stewardship program, the President shall--
            (1) immediately notify Congress of the problem; and
            (2) submit to Congress in a timely manner a plan for 
        corrective action with respect to the problem, including--
                    (A) a technical description of the activities 
                required under the plan; and
                    (B) if underground testing of nuclear weapons would 
                assist in such corrective action, an assessment of 
                advisability of withdrawing from any treaty that 
                prohibits underground testing of nuclear weapons.

                  TITLE XXXVI--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISION

SEC. 3601. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE REOPENING OF PENNSYLVANIA 
              AVENUE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) In 1791, President George Washington commissioned 
        Pierre Charles L'Enfant to draft a blueprint for America's new 
        capital city; they envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue as a bold, 
        ceremonial boulevard physically linking the U.S. Capitol 
        building and the White House, and symbolically the Legislative 
        and Executive branches of government.
            (2) An integral element of the District of Columbia, 
        Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, working, 
        unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of national 
        importance as ``America's Main Street''.
            (3) 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, has become 
        America's most recognized address and a primary destination of 
        visitors to the Nation's Capital; ``the People's House'' is 
        host to 5,000 tourists daily, and 15,000,000 annually.
            (4) As home to the President, and given its prominent 
        location on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the 
        People, the White House has become a powerful symbol of 
        freedom, openness, and an individual's access to their 
        government.
            (5) On May 20, 1995, citing possible security risks from 
        vehicles transporting terrorist bombs, President Clinton 
        ordered the Secret Service, in conjunction with the Department 
        of the Treasury, to close Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular 
        traffic for two blocks in front of the White House.
            (6) While the security of the President and visitors to the 
        White House is of grave concern and is not to be taken lightly, 
        the need to assure the President's safety must be balanced with 
        the expectation of freedom inherent in a democracy; the present 
        situation is tilted too heavily toward security at freedom's 
        expense.
            (7) By impeding access and imposing undue hardships upon 
        tourists, residents of the District, commuters, and local 
        business owners and their customers, the closure of 
        Pennsylvania Avenue, undertaken without the counsel of the 
        government of the District of Columbia, has replaced the former 
        openness of the area surrounding the White House with 
        barricades, additional security checkpoints, and an atmosphere 
        of fear and distrust.
            (8) In the year following the closure of Pennsylvania 
        Avenue, the taxpayers have borne a significant burden for 
        additional security measures along the Avenue near the White 
        House.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
President should request the Department of the Treasury and the Secret 
Service to work with the Government of the District of Columbia to 
develop a plan for the permanent reopening to vehicular traffic of 
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House in order to restore the 
Avenue to its original state and return it to the people: Provided, 
That the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secret Service certify that 
the plan protects the security of the people who live and work in the 
White House.

            Passed the Senate July 10, 1996.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
