SEC. 253. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF RURAL RENAISSANCE BONDS.

    (a) In General.--Subpart H of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 
(relating to credits against tax) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new section:

``SEC. 54A. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF RURAL RENAISSANCE BONDS.

    ``(a) Allowance of Credit.--In the case of a taxpayer who holds a 
rural renaissance bond on a credit allowance date of such bond, which 
occurs during the taxable year, there shall be allowed as a credit 
against the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year an amount 
equal to the sum of the credits determined under subsection (b) with 
respect to credit allowance dates during such year on which the 
taxpayer holds such bond.
    ``(b) Amount of Credit.--
            ``(1) In general.--The amount of the credit determined 
        under this subsection with respect to any credit allowance date 
        for a rural renaissance bond is 25 percent of the annual credit 
        determined with respect to such bond.
            ``(2) Annual credit.--The annual credit determined with 
        respect to any rural renaissance bond is the product of--
                    ``(A) the credit rate determined by the Secretary 
                under paragraph (3) for the day on which such bond was 
                sold, multiplied by
                    ``(B) the outstanding face amount of the bond.
            ``(3) Determination.--For purposes of paragraph (2), with 
        respect to any rural renaissance bond, the Secretary shall 
        determine daily or caused to be determined daily a credit rate 
        which shall apply to the first day on which there is a binding, 
        written contract for the sale or exchange of the bond. The 
        credit rate for any day is the credit rate which the Secretary 
        or the Secretary's designee estimates will permit the issuance 
        of rural renaissance bonds with a specified maturity or 
        redemption date without discount and without interest cost to 
        the qualified issuer.
            ``(4) Credit allowance date.--For purposes of this section, 
        the term `credit allowance date' means--
                    ``(A) March 15,
                    ``(B) June 15,
                    ``(C) September 15, and
                    ``(D) December 15.
        Such term also includes the last day on which the bond is 
        outstanding.
            ``(5) Special rule for issuance and redemption.--In the 
        case of a bond which is issued during the 3-month period ending 
        on a credit allowance date, the amount of the credit determined 
        under this subsection with respect to such credit allowance 
        date shall be a ratable portion of the credit otherwise 
        determined based on the portion of the 3-month period during 
        which the bond is outstanding. A similar rule shall apply when 
        the bond is redeemed or matures.
    ``(c) Limitation Based on Amount of Tax.--The credit allowed under 
subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess of--
            ``(1) the sum of the regular tax liability (as defined in 
        section 26(b)) plus the tax imposed by section 55, over
            ``(2) the sum of the credits allowable under this part 
        (other than subpart C and this section).
    ``(d) Rural Renaissance Bond.--For purposes of this section--
            ``(1) In general.--The term `rural renaissance bond' means 
        any bond issued as part of an issue if--
                    ``(A) the bond is issued by a qualified issuer,
                    ``(B) 95 percent or more of the proceeds from the

        Secretary shall determine the maximum term permitted under this 
        paragraph for bonds issued during the following calendar month. 
        Such maximum term shall be the term which the Secretary 
        estimates will result in the present value of the obligation to 
        repay the principal on the bond being equal to 50 percent of 
        the face amount of such bond. Such present value shall be 
        determined without regard to the requirements of paragraph (3) 
        and using as a discount rate the average annual interest rate 
        of tax-exempt obligations having a term of 10 years or more 
        which are issued during the month. If the term as so determined 
        is not a multiple of a whole year, such term shall be rounded 
        to the next highest whole year.
            ``(3) Ratable principal amortization required.--A bond 
        shall not be treated as a rural renaissance bond unless it is 
        part of an issue which provides for an equal amount of 
        principal to be paid by the qualified issuer during each 
        calendar year that the issue is outstanding.

        prior to the expiration of the period described in paragraph 
        (1)(A), the Secretary may extend such period if the qualified 
        issuer establishes that the failure to satisfy the 5-year 
        requirement is due to reasonable cause and the related projects 
        will continue to proceed with due diligence.

        period beginning on the date of issuance (or if an extension
