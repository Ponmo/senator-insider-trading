        other direct contractual arrangement between such professional 
        and a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering 
        health insurance coverage in connection with a group health 
        plan, the plan or issuer with which such contractual employment 
        arrangement or other direct contractual arrangement is 
        maintained by the professional may not impose on such 
        professional under such arrangement any prohibition or 
        restriction with respect to advice, provided to a participant 
        or beneficiary under the plan who is a patient, about the 
        health status of the participant or beneficiary or the medical 
        care or treatment for the condition or disease of the 
        participant or beneficiary, regardless of whether benefits for 
        such care or treatment are provided under the plan or health 
        insurance coverage offered in connection with the plan.
            ``(2) Health care professional defined.--For purposes of 
        this subsection, the term `health care professional' means a 
        physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Social Security

        (or health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage 
        in connection with the plan) provides for any benefits 
        consisting of emergency medical care (as defined in section 
        503(b)(9)(I)), except for items or services specifically 
        excluded--

                (within the capability of the emergency facility, 
                including ancillary services routinely available to the 
                emergency facility) to the extent that a prudent 
                layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health 
                and medicine, would determine such examinations to be 
                necessary in order to determine whether emergency 
                medical care (as so defined) is required; and

                emergency medical screening examination (if determined 
                necessary under subparagraph (A)) to the extent that a 
                prudent emergency medical professional would determine 
                such additional emergency services to be necessary to 
                avoid the consequences described in section 
                503(b)(9)(I).
            ``(2) Uniform cost-sharing required.--Nothing in this 
        subsection shall be construed as preventing a group health plan 
        or issuer from imposing any form of cost-sharing applicable to 
        any participant or beneficiary (including coinsurance, 
        copayments, deductibles, and any other charges) in relation to 
        benefits described in paragraph (1), if such form of cost-
        sharing is uniformly applied under such plan, with respect to 
        similarly situated participants and beneficiaries, to all 
        benefits consisting of emergency medical care (as defined in 
        section 503(b)(9)(I)) provided to such similarly situated 
        participants and beneficiaries under the plan.

                in such care (or provides benefits consisting of

                the care described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph 
                (1)(A), as the authorization of the primary care 
                provider with respect to such care.

        participating physician who specializes in pediatrics (or

date under such amendments. The Secretary shall first issue regulations 
necessary to carry out the amendments made by this section before the 
effective date thereof.
    (b) Limitation on Enforcement Actions.--No enforcement action shall 
be taken, pursuant to the amendments made by this subtitle, against a 
group health plan or health insurance issuer with respect to a 
violation of a requirement imposed by such amendments before the date 
of issuance of regulations issued in connection with such requirement, 
if the plan or issuer has sought to comply in good faith with such 
requirement.
    (c) Special Rule for Collective Bargaining Agreements.--In the case 
of a group health plan maintained pursuant to one or more collective 
bargaining agreements between employee representatives and one or more 
employers ratified before the date of the enactment of this Act, the

        enactment of this Act); or
            (2) January 1, 2001.
For purposes of this subsection, any plan amendment made pursuant to a 
collective bargaining agreement relating to the plan which amends the

agreement.
    (d) Assuring Coordination.--The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
ensure, through the execution of an interagency memorandum of 
understanding among such Secretaries, that--

        such Secretaries relating to the same matter over which two or 
        more such Secretaries have responsibility under the provisions

        (and the amendments made thereby) are administered so as to 
        have the same effect at all times; and
            (2) coordination of policies relating to enforcing the same

                providers;
                    (B) require such plans or issuers to--
                            (i) utilize medically based eligibility

                            (iii) utilize medical professionals or

                    (C) require such plans or issuers to exclude

                treatment or nursing care provided by the provider.

Any regulations prescribed by the applicable authority pursuant to 
clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) may allow for such adjustments 
in the required levels of excess/stop loss insurance as the qualified 
actuary may recommend, taking into account the specific circumstances 
of the plan.

requirements of this subsection are met if the plan establishes and 
maintains surplus in an amount at least equal to $2,000,000, reduced in

authority to an amount not less than $500,000, based on the level of 
aggregate and specific excess/stop loss insurance provided with respect

otherwise, with respect to any such plan or any class of such plans.

subsection (a)(2)(B)(iii)), such security, guarantee, hold-harmless 
arrangement, or other financial arrangement as the applicable authority 
determines to be adequate to enable the plan to fully meet all its 
financial obligations on a timely basis and is otherwise no less 
protective of the interests of participants and beneficiaries than the 
requirements for which it is substituted. The applicable authority may 
take into account, for purposes of this subsection, evidence provided 
by the plan or sponsor which demonstrates an assumption of liability 
with respect to the plan. Such evidence may be in the form of a 
contract of indemnification, lien, bonding, insurance, letter of 
credit, recourse under applicable terms of the plan in the form of

``SEC. 2801. DEFINITION OF HEALTHMART.

    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of this title, the term 
`HealthMart' means a legal entity that meets the following 
requirements:
            ``(1) Organization.--The HealthMart is a nonprofit 
        organization operated under the direction of a board of 
        directors which is composed of representatives of not fewer 
        than 2 and in equal numbers from each of the following:
                    ``(A) Small employers.
                    ``(B) Employees of small employers.
                    ``(C) Health care providers, which may be 
                physicians, other health care professionals, health 
                care facilities, or any combination thereof.
                    ``(D) Entities, such as insurance companies, health 
                maintenance organizations, and licensed provider-
                sponsored organizations, that underwrite or administer 
                health benefits coverage.
            ``(2) Offering health benefits coverage.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The HealthMart, in conjunction 
                with those health insurance issuers that offer health 
                benefits coverage through the HealthMart, makes 
                available health benefits coverage in the manner 
                described in subsection (b) to all small employers and 
                eligible employees in the manner described in 
                subsection (c)(2) at rates (including employer's and 
                employee's share) that are established by the health 
                insurance issuer on a policy or product specific basis 
                and that may vary only as permissible under State law. 
                A HealthMart is deemed to be a group health plan for 
                purposes of applying section 702 of the Employee 
                Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, section 2702 of 
                this Act, and section 9802(b) of the Internal Revenue 
                Code of 1986 (which limit variation among similarly 
                situated individuals of required premiums for health 
                benefits coverage on the basis of health status-related 
                factors).
                    ``(B) Nondiscrimination in coverage offered.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), 
                        the HealthMart may not offer health benefits 
                        coverage to an eligible employee in a 
                        geographic area (as specified under paragraph 
                        (3)(A)) unless the same coverage is offered to 
                        all such employees in the same geographic area. 
                        Section 2711(a)(1)(B) of this Act limits denial 
                        of enrollment of certain eligible individuals 
                        under health benefits coverage in the small 
                        group market.
                            ``(ii) Construction.--Nothing in this title 
                        shall be construed as requiring or permitting a 
                        health insurance issuer to provide coverage 
                        outside the service area of the issuer, as 
                        approved under State law.
                    ``(C) No financial underwriting.--The HealthMart 
                provides health benefits coverage only through 
                contracts with health insurance issuers and does not 
                assume insurance risk with respect to such coverage.
                    (D) Minimum coverage.--By the end of the first year 
                of its operation and thereafter, the HealthMart 
                maintains not fewer than 10 purchasers and 100 members.
            ``(3) Geographic areas.--
                    ``(A) Specification of geographic areas.--The 
                HealthMart shall specify the geographic area (or areas) 
                in which it makes available health benefits coverage 
                offered by health insurance issuers to small employers. 
                Such an area shall encompass at least one entire county 
                or equivalent area.
                    ``(B) Multistate areas.--In the case of a 
                HealthMart that serves more than one State, such 
                geographic areas may be areas that include portions of 
                two or more contiguous States.
                    ``(C) Multiple healthmarts permitted in single 
                geographic area.--Nothing in this title shall be 
                construed as preventing the establishment and operation 
                of more than one HealthMart in a geographic area or as 
                limiting the number of HealthMarts that may operate in 
                any area.
            ``(4) Provision of administrative services to purchasers.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The HealthMart provides 
                administrative services for purchasers. Such services 
                may include accounting, billing, enrollment 
                information, and employee coverage status reports.
                    ``(B) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
                shall be construed as preventing a HealthMart from 
                serving as an administrative service organization to 
                any entity.
            ``(5) Dissemination of information.--The HealthMart 
        collects and disseminates (or arranges for the collection and 
        dissemination of) consumer-oriented information on the scope, 
        cost, and enrollee satisfaction of all coverage options offered 
        through the HealthMart to its members and eligible individuals. 
        Such information shall be defined by the HealthMart and shall 
        be in a manner appropriate to the type of coverage offered. To 
        the extent practicable, such information shall include 
        information on provider performance, locations and hours of 
        operation of providers, outcomes, and similar matters. Nothing 
        in this section shall be construed as preventing the 
        dissemination of such information or other information by the 
        HealthMart or by health insurance issuers through electronic or 
        other means.
            ``(6) Filing information.--The HealthMart--
                    ``(A) files with the applicable Federal authority 
                information that demonstrates the HealthMart's 
                compliance with the applicable requirements of this 
                title; or
                    ``(B) in accordance with rules established under 
                section 2803(a), files with a State such information as 
                the State may require to demonstrate such compliance.
    ``(b) Health Benefits Coverage Requirements.--

        Any health benefits coverage offered through a HealthMart 
        shall--

                with the provisions of the parts 6 and 7 of subtitle B 
                of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security 
                Act of 1974 and titles XXII and XXVII of this Act, so 
                long as both employers are purchasers in the 
                HealthMart.

                product files an application to waive such requirement 
                with the applicable Federal authority, and the 
                authority determines, based on the application and

                coverage with the applicable State standards described

        scope of benefits, but not including requirements to the extent 
        required to implement title XXVII or other Federal law and to 
        the extent the requirement prohibits an exclusion of a specific 
        disease from such coverage.

        requirements of this title.
Any State law or regulation relating to the composition or organization 
of a HealthMart is preempted to the extent the law or regulation is 
inconsistent with the provisions of this title.

administrator of an employee welfare benefit plan which is a group

any health insurance coverage after the date of such termination, the

        situated purchasers and members from the remaining 
        participating health insurance issuers in the same manner as 
        would be required of issuers under section 2712(c).

this title shall be construed as modifying or affecting the 
applicability to HealthMarts or health benefits coverage offered by a

following new section:

                of Health and Human Services (in this section referred 
                to as the `Secretary') by not later than November 1, 
                2003; and

                application and other evidence presented to the 
                Secretary, that any of the grounds for approval of the 
                application described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) 
                of paragraph (2) has been met.

                    ``(A) Failure to act on licensure application on a 
                timely basis.--The ground for approval of such a waiver 
                application described in this subparagraph is that the 
                State has failed to complete action on a licensing 
                application of the organization within 90 days of the 
                date of the State's receipt of a substantially complete 
                application. No period before the date of the enactment 
                of this section shall be included in determining such 
                90-day period.
                    ``(B) Denial of application based on discriminatory 
                treatment.--The ground for approval of such a waiver 
                application described in this subparagraph is that the 
                State has denied such a licensing application and the 
                standards or review process imposed by the State as a 
                condition of approval of the license or as the basis 
                for such denial by the State imposes any material 
                requirements, procedures, or standards (other than 
                solvency requirements) to such organizations that are 
                not generally applicable to other entities engaged in a 
                substantially similar business.
                    ``(C) Denial of application based on application of 
                solvency requirements.--With respect to waiver 
                applications filed on or after the date of publication 
                of solvency standards established by the Secretary 
                under subsection (d), the ground for approval of such a 
                waiver application described in this subparagraph is 
                that the State has denied such a licensing application 
                based (in whole or in part) on the organization's 
                failure to meet applicable State solvency requirements 
                and such requirements are not the same as the solvency 
                standards established by the Secretary. For purposes of 
                this subparagraph, the term solvency requirements means 
                requirements relating to solvency and other matters 
                covered under the standards established by the 
                Secretary under subsection (d).

        under this subsection for a community health organization with 
        respect to a State--
                    ``(A) Limitation to state.--The waiver shall be 
                effective only with respect to that State and does not 
                apply to any other State.
                    ``(B) Limitation to 36-month period.--The waiver 
                shall be effective only for a 36-month period but may 
                be renewed for up to 36 additional months if the 
                Secretary determines that such an extension is 
                appropriate.
                    ``(C) Conditioned on compliance with consumer 
                protection and quality standards.--The continuation of 
                the waiver is conditioned upon the organization's

SEC. 3203. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that patients are 
best served when they are empowered to make informed choices about 
their own health care. The same is true regarding an individual's 
choice of health insurance. A system that gives people the power to 
choose the coverage that best meets their needs, combined with 
insurance market reforms, offers great promise of increased choices and 
greater access to health insurance for Americans.

SEC. 4003. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This title will apply to--
            (1) any health care liability action brought in a Federal 
        or State court; and
            (2) any health care liability claim subject to an 
        alternative dispute resolution system,
that is initiated on or after the date of enactment of this title, 
except that any health care liability claim or action arising from an 
injury occurring before the date of enactment of this title shall be 
governed by the applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect 
at the time the injury occurred.

    Subtitle B--Uniform Standards for Health Care Liability Actions

SEC. 4011. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

    A health care liability action may not be brought after the 
expiration of the 2-year period that begins on the date on which the 
alleged injury that is the subject of the action was discovered or 
should reasonably have been discovered, but in no case after the 
expiration of the 5-year period that begins on the date the alleged 
injury occurred.

SEC. 4012. CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES.

    (a) Treatment of Non-Economic Damages.--
            (1) Limitation on non-economic damages.--The total amount 
        of non-economic damages that may be awarded to a claimant for 
        losses resulting from the injury which is the subject of a 
        health care liability action may not exceed $250,000, 
        regardless of the number of parties against whom the action is 
        brought or the number of actions brought with respect to the 
        injury. The limitation under this paragraph shall not apply to 
        an action for damages based solely on intentional denial of 
        medical treatment necessary to preserve a patient's life that 
        the patient is otherwise qualified to receive, against the 
        wishes of a patient, or if the patient is incompetent, against 
        the wishes of the patient's guardian, on the basis of the 
        patient's present or predicated age, disability, degree of 
        medical dependency, or quality of life.
            (2) Limit.--If, after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, a State enacts a law which prescribes the amount of non-
        economic damages which may be awarded in a health care 
        liability action which is different from the amount prescribed 
        by section 4012(a)(1), the State amount shall apply in lieu of 
        the amount prescribed by such section. If, after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, a State enacts a law which limits 
        the amount of recovery in a health care liability action 
        without delineating between economic and non-economic damages, 
        the State amount shall apply in lieu of the amount prescribed 
        by such section.
            (3) Joint and several liability.--In any health care 
        liability action brought in State or Federal court, a defendant 
        shall be liable only for the amount of non-economic damages 
        attributable to such defendant in direct proportion to such 
        defendant's share of fault or responsibility for the claimant's 
        actual damages, as determined by the trier of fact. In all such 
        cases, the liability of a defendant for non-economic damages 
        shall be several and not joint and a separate judgment shall be 
        rendered against each defendant for the amount allocated to 
        such defendant.
    (b) Treatment of Punitive Damages.--
            (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may, to the extent 
        permitted by applicable State law, be awarded in any health 
        care liability action for harm in any Federal or State court 
        against a defendant if the claimant establishes by clear and 
        convincing evidence that the harm suffered was the result of 
        conduct--
                    (A) specifically intended to cause harm; or
                    (B) conduct manifesting a conscious, flagrant 
                indifference to the rights or safety of others.
            (2) Applicability.--This subsection shall apply to any 
        health care liability action brought in any Federal or State 
        court on any theory where punitive damages are sought. This 
        subsection does not create a cause of action for punitive 
        damages. This subsection does not preempt or supersede any 
        State or Federal law to the extent that such law would further 
        limit the award of punitive damages.
            (3) Bifurcation.--At the request of any party, the trier of 
        fact shall consider in a separate proceeding whether punitive 
        damages are to be awarded and the amount of such award. If a 
        separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the 
        claim of punitive damages, as determined by applicable State 
        law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine 
        whether actual damages are to be awarded.
            (4) Drugs and devices.--
                    (A) In general.--
                            (i) Punitive damages.--Punitive damages 
                        shall not be awarded against a manufacturer or 
                        product seller of a drug or medical device 
                        which caused the claimant's harm where--
                                    (I) such drug or device was subject 
                                to premarket approval by the Food and 
                                Drug Administration with respect to the 
                                safety of the formulation or 
                                performance of the aspect of such drug 
                                or device which caused the claimant's 
                                harm, or the adequacy of the packaging 
                                or labeling of such drug or device 
                                which caused the harm, and such drug, 
                                device, packaging, or labeling was 
                                approved by the Food and Drug 
                                Administration; or
                                    (II) the drug is generally 
                                recognized as safe and effective 
                                pursuant to conditions established by 
                                the Food and Drug Administration and 
                                applicable regulations, including 
                                packaging and labeling regulations.
                            (ii) Application.--Clause (i) shall not 
                        apply in any case in which the defendant, 
                        before or after premarket approval of a drug or 
                        device--
                                    (I) intentionally and wrongfully 
                                withheld from or misrepresented to the 
                                Food and Drug Administration 
                                information concerning such drug or 
                                device required to be submitted under 
                                the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
                                Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or section 
                                351 of the Public Health Service Act 
                                (42 U.S.C. 262) that is material and 
                                relevant to the harm suffered by the 
                                claimant; or
                                    (II) made an illegal payment to an 
                                official or employee of the Food and 
                                Drug Administration for the purpose of 
                                securing or maintaining approval of 
                                such drug or device.
                    (B) Packaging.--In a health care liability action 
                for harm which is alleged to relate to the adequacy of 
                the packaging or labeling of a drug which is required 
                to have tamper-resistant packaging under regulations of 
                the Secretary of Health and Human Services (including 
                labeling regulations related to such packaging), the 
                manufacturer or product seller of the drug shall not be 
                held liable for punitive damages unless such packaging 
                or labeling is found by the court by clear and 
                convincing evidence to be substantially out of 
                compliance with such regulations.
    (c) Periodic Payments for Future Losses.--
            (1) General rule.--In any health care liability action in 
        which the damages awarded for future economic and non-economic 
        loss exceeds $50,000, a person shall not be required to pay 
        such damages in a single, lump-sum payment, but shall be 
        permitted to make such payments periodically based on when the 
        damages are likely to occur, as such payments are determined by 
        the court.
            (2) Finality of judgment.--The judgment of the court 
        awarding periodic payments under this subsection may not, in 
        the absence of fraud, be reopened at any time to contest, 
        amend, or modify the schedule or amount of the payments.
            (3) Lump-sum settlements.--This subsection shall not be 
        construed to preclude a settlement providing for a single, 
        lump-sum payment.
    (d) Treatment of Collateral Source Payments.--
            (1) Introduction into evidence.--In any health care 
        liability action, any defendant may introduce evidence of 
        collateral source payments. If any defendant elects to 
        introduce such evidence, the claimant may introduce evidence of 
        any amount paid or contributed or reasonably likely to be paid 
        or contributed in the future by or on behalf of the claimant to 
        secure the right to such collateral source payments.
            (2) No subrogation.--No provider of collateral source 
        payments shall recover any amount against the claimant or
