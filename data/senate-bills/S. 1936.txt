Act shall affect any such procedures, or any licenses or approvals 
issued pursuant to such procedures in effect on the date of enactment.

``SEC. 205. PERMANENT REPOSITORY.

    ``(a) Repository Characterization.--
            ``(1) Guidelines.--The guidelines promulgated by the 
        Secretary and published at part 960 of title 10, Code of 
        Federal Regulations are annulled and revoked and the Secretary 
        shall make no assumptions or conclusions about the 
        licensability of the Yucca Mountain site as a repository by 
        reference to such guidelines.
            ``(2) Site characterization activities.--The Secretary 
        shall carry out appropriate site characterization activities at 
        the Yucca Mountain site in accordance with the Secretary's 
        program approach to site characterization. The Secretary shall 
        modify or eliminate those site characterization activities 
        designed only to demonstrate the suitability of the site under 
        the guidelines referenced in paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Schedule date.--Consistent with the schedule set 
        forth in the program approach, as modified to be consistent 
        with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, no later than 
        February 1, 2002, the Secretary shall apply to the Commission 
        for authorization to construct a repository. If, at any time 
        prior to the filing of such application, the Secretary 
        determines that the Yucca Mountain site cannot satisfy the 
        Commission's regulations applicable to the licensing of a 
        geologic repository, the Secretary shall terminate site 
        characterization activities at the site, notify Congress and 
        the State of Nevada of the Secretary's determination and the 
        reasons therefor, and recommend to Congress not later than 6 
        months after such determination, further actions, including the

        Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
            ``(4) Maximizing capacity.--In developing an application 
        for authorization to construct the repository, the Secretary 
        shall seek to maximize the capacity of the repository, in the 
        most cost-effective manner, consistent with the need for 
        disposal capacity.
    ``(b) Repository Licensing.--Upon the completion of any licensing 
proceeding for the first phase of the interim storage facility, the 
Commission shall amend its regulations governing the disposal of spent 
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in geologic repositories 
to the extent necessary to comply with this Act. Subject to subsection 
(c), such regulations shall provide for the licensing of the repository 
according to the following procedures:
            ``(1) Construction authorization.--The Commission shall 
        grant the Secretary a construction authorization for the 
        repository upon determining that there is reasonable assurance 
        that spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste can be 
        disposed of in the repository--
                    ``(A) in conformity with the Secretary's 
                application, the provisions of this Act, and the 
                regulations of the Commission;

        construction and the filing of any additional information 
        needed to complete the license application, the Commission 
        shall issue a license to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and 
        high-level radioactive waste in the repository if the 
        Commission determines that the repository has been constructed 
        and will operate--
                    ``(A) in conformity with the Secretary's 
                application, the provisions of this Act, and the

        high-level radioactive waste in the repository and collecting 
        sufficient confirmatory data on repository performance to 
        reasonably confirm the basis for repository closure consistent 
        with the Commission's regulations applicable to the licensing 
        of a repository, as modified in accordance with this Act, the 
        Secretary shall apply to the Commission to amend the license to 
        permit permanent closure of the repository. The Commission 
        shall grant such license amendment upon finding that there is 
        reasonable assurance that the repository can be permanently 
        closed--

                security.
            ``(4) Post-closure.--The Secretary shall take those actions 
        necessary and appropriate at the Yucca Mountain site to prevent 
        any activity at the site subsequent to repository closure that 
        poses an unreasonable risk of--
                    ``(A) breaching the repository's engineered or 
                geologic barriers; or

Commission's regulations shall provide for the modification of the 
repository licensing procedure, as appropriate, in the event that the 
Secretary seeks a license to permit the emplacement in the repository, 
on a retrievable basis, of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive 
waste as is necessary to provide the Secretary with sufficient 
confirmatory data on repository performance to reasonably confirm the 
basis for repository closure consistent with applicable regulations.
    ``(d) Repository Licensing Standards.--The Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency shall, pursuant to authority under 
other provisions of law, issue generally applicable standards for the 
protection of the public from releases of radioactive materials or 
radioactivity from the repository. Such standards shall be consistent 
with the overall system performance standard established by this 
subsection unless the Administrator determines by rule that the overall 
system performance standard would constitute an unreasonable risk to 
health and safety. The Commission's repository licensing determinations 
for the protection of the public shall be based solely on a finding 
whether the repository can be operated in conformance with the overall 
system performance standard established in paragraph (1), applied in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2), and the 
Administrator's radiation protection standards. The Commission shall 
amend its regulations in accordance with subsection (b) to incorporate 
each of the following licensing standards:
            ``(1) Establishment of overall system performance 
        standard.--The standard for protection of the public from 
        release of radioactive material or radioactivity from the 
        repository shall prohibit releases that would expose an average 
        member of the general population in the vicinity of the Yucca 
        Mountain site to an annual dose in excess of 100 millirems 
        unless the Commission determines by rule that such standard 
        would constitute an unreasonable risk to health and safety and 
        establishes by rule another standard which will protect health 
        and safety. Such standard shall constitute an overall system 
        performance standard.
            ``(2) Application of overall system performance standard.--
        The Commission shall issue the license if it finds reasonable 
        assurance that for the first 1,000 years following the 
        commencement of repository operations, the overall system 
        performance standard will be met based on a probabilistic 
        evaluation, as appropriate, of compliance with the overall 
        system performance standard in paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Factors.--For purposes of making the finding in 
        paragraph (2)--
                    ``(A) the Commission shall not consider 
                catastrophic events where the health consequences of 
                individual events themselves can be reasonably assumed 
                to exceed the health consequences due to the impact of 
                the events on repository performance;

                age, general health, agricultural practices, eating 
                habits, and social behavior represent the average for 
                persons living in the vicinity of the site. Extremes in

                barriers and the Secretary's post-closure actions at 
                the Yucca Mountain site, in accordance with subsection 
                (b)(4), shall be sufficient to--

                        in paragraph (1).
            ``(4) Additional analysis.--The Commission shall analyze 
        the overall system performance through the use of probabilistic 
        evaluations that use best estimate assumptions, data, and 
        methods for the period commencing after the first 1,000 years 
        of operation of the repository and terminating at 10,000 years 
        after the commencement of operation of the repository.

        of the repository shall be considered a major Federal action 
        significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
        for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
        (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). The Secretary shall submit an 
        environmental impact statement on the construction and 
        operation of the repository to the Commission with the license 
        application and shall supplement such environmental impact 
        statement as appropriate.

        requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
        and this section, the Secretary shall not consider in the 
        environmental impact statement the need for the repository, or 
        alternative sites or designs for the repository.
            ``(3) Adoption by commission.--The Secretary's 
        environmental impact statement and any supplements thereto 
        shall, to the extent practicable, be adopted by the Commission 
        in connection with the issuance by the Commission of a 
        construction authorization under subsection (b)(1), a license 
        under subsection (b)(2), or a license amendment under 
        subsection (b)(3). To the extent such statement or supplement 
        is adopted by the Commission, such adoption shall be deemed to 
        also satisfy the responsibilities of the Commission under the 
        National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and no further 
        consideration shall be required, except that nothing in this 
        subsection shall affect any independent responsibilities of the 
        Commission to protect the public health and safety under the 
        Atomic Energy Act of 1954. In any such statement or supplement 
        prepared with respect to the repository, the Commission shall 
        not consider the need for a repository, or alternate sites or 
        designs for the repository.

issuance of the Commission repository licensing regulations prior to 
its final decision on review of such regulations.

        Fund on the date of enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
        of 1996, to evaluate whether collection of the fee will provide 
        sufficient revenues to offset the costs as defined in 
        subsection (c)(2). In the event the Secretary determines that 
        the revenues being collected are either insufficient or 
        excessive to recover the costs incurred by the Federal 
        Government that are specified in subsection (c)(2), the 
        Secretary shall propose an adjustment to the fee in subsection

January 7, 1983, to expand the spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at 
the site of a civilian nuclear power reactor, through the use of high-
density fuel storage racks, fuel rod compaction, the transshipment of 
spent nuclear fuel to another civilian nuclear power reactor within the 
same utility system, the construction of additional spent nuclear fuel 
pool capacity or dry storage capacity, or by other means, the 
Commission shall, at the request of any party, provide an opportunity 
for oral argument with respect to any matter which the Commission 
determines to be in controversy among the parties. The oral argument 
shall be preceded by such discovery procedures as the rules of the 
Commission shall provide. The Commission shall require each party, 
including the Commission staff, to submit in written form, at the time 
of the oral argument, a summary of the facts, data, and arguments upon 
which such party proposes to rely that are known at such time to such 
party. Only facts and data in the form of sworn testimony or written 
submission may be relied upon by the parties during oral argument. Of 
the materials that may be submitted by the parties during oral 
argument, the Commission shall only consider those facts and data that 
are submitted in the form of sworn testimony or written submission.
