until the required proficiency level is regained.

SEC. 153. DESIGNATION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE RESOURCES COORDINATOR.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the post-Cold War era is placing increasing demands on 
        limited Federal foreign language resources available to support 
        diplomacy, intelligence, military preparedness, international 
        security, and global economic competitiveness goals;
            (2) the absence of a single interagency mechanism to 
        coordinate Federal foreign language resources represents a 
        significant weakness in the United States Government's ability 
        to mobilize and direct existing foreign language assets in 
        support of national foreign policy goals; and
            (3) there is a growing need for coordination of all Federal 
        agencies maintaining and utilizing foreign language resources--
                    (A) to increase cost-effectiveness through sharing 
                of resources;
                    (B) to identify foreign language needs and 
                priorities required to support foreign policy 
                objectives; and
                    (C) to identify foreign language resources capable 
                of supporting global economic competitiveness goals and 
                to facilitate private sector access to those resources.
    (b) Policy.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of State, by virtue of his overall 
        responsibility under section 701(a) of the Foreign Service Act 
        of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4011(a)) for training and instruction in the 
        field of foreign relations to meet the needs of all Federal 
        agencies, should take the lead in this effort; and
            (2) in order to avoid other Federal agencies duplicating 
        the facilities and training provided by the Secretary of State, 
        a goal set out in section 701(b) of the Foreign Service Act of 
        1980 (22 U.S.C. 4011(b)), the Secretary of State should call 
        upon other Federal agencies to share in the joint management 
        and coordination of Federal foreign language resources.
    (c) Designation of Position and Duties.--(1) The Secretary of State 
shall appoint a Foreign Language Resources Coordinator (in this 
subsection referred to as the ``Coordinator'') who shall be 
responsible--
            (A) for coordinating the efforts of the appropriate 
        agencies of Government--
                    (i) to strengthen mechanisms for sharing of foreign 
                language resources; and
                    (ii) to identify Federal foreign language resource 
                requirements in the areas of diplomacy, intelligence, 
                military preparedness, international security, and 
                other foreign policy objectives; and
            (B) for making recommendations to the Secretary of State as 
        to which Federal foreign language assets, if any, should be 
        made available to the private sector in support of national 
        global economic competitiveness goals.
    (2) All United States Government agencies maintaining and utilizing 
Federal foreign language training and related resources shall cooperate 
fully with the Coordinator.

SEC. 154. FOREIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR AND INTERPRETER CAREER SERVICE 
              PROGRAM.

    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section--
            (1) to enhance the capability of the Department of State to 
        provide cost-effective, timely, and reliable translation and

                institution of higher education in the United States; 
                and
                    (B) is pursuing a full-time program in a foreign 
                language translation or interpretation;
            (2) the institution and the program meet the accreditation, 
        curriculum, certification, and other standards prescribed by 
        the Secretary; and
            (3) the individual submits a written application to the 
        Secretary and meets the minimum criteria prescribed by the 
        Secretary.
    (d) Noncompliance.--Any individual participating in the program who 
fails to complete a program meeting the standards prescribed in 
subsection (c)(2) shall reimburse the Department of State for the 
Federal funds expended for such individual's tuition, together with 
interest on such funds (calculated at the prevailing rate).
    (e) Surcharge for Certain Foreign Language Services.--(1) 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of State is 
authorized to levy a surcharge, or otherwise solicit funds, for 
providing other executive branch agencies with foreign language 
translation and interpretation services for which the Secretary of 
State has determined for purposes of subsection (b)(2) there is a 
shortage of qualified Government personnel.
    (2) Funds collected under the authority of subsection (e) shall be 
deposited as an offsetting collection to any Department of State 
appropriation to recover the cost of providing translation or

including the cost of training translators or interpreters pursuant to 
subsection (b).

                  PART E--INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

             Subpart A--United Nations and Related Agencies

SEC. 161. LIMITATION ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND 
              AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS.

    The United States shall not make any voluntary or assessed 
contribution--
            (1) to any affiliated organization of the United Nations 
        which grants full membership as a state to any organization or 
        group that does not have the internationally recognized 
        attributes of statehood, or
            (2) to the United Nations, if the United Nations grants 
        full membership as a state in the United Nations to any 
        organization or group that does not have the internationally 
        recognized attributes of statehood, during any period in which 
        such membership is effective.

SEC. 162. UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The effectiveness of the United Nations Security 
        Council in maintaining international peace and security depends 
        on its being representative of the membership of the United 
        Nations.
            (2) The requirement of equitable geographic distribution in 
        Article 23 of the United Nations Charter requires that the 
        members of the Security Council of the United Nations be chosen 
        by nondiscriminatory means.
            (3) The use of informal regional groups of the General 
        Assembly as the sole means for election of the nonpermanent 
        members of the Security Council is inherently discriminatory in 
        the absence of guarantees that all member states will have the 
        opportunity to join a regional group, and has resulted in 
        discrimination against Israel.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should direct the Secretary of State to request the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations to seek immediate resolution of 
the problem described in this section. The President shall inform the 
Congress of any progress in resolving this situation, together with the 
submission to Congress of the request for funding for the 
``Contributions to International Organizations'' account of the 
Department of State for the fiscal year 1995.

SEC. 163. REFORMS IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
United States contributions to the World Health Organization (WHO) 
should be utilized in the most effective and efficient manner possible, 
particularly for the reduction of diseases and disabilities in 
developing countries. The President shall direct the United States 
representatives to the World Health Assembly, the Executive Board, and 
the World Health Organization to monitor the activities of the World 
Health Organization to ensure that such organizations achieve--
            (1) the timely implementation of reforms and management 
        improvements, including those outlined in the resolutions of 
        the 46th World Health Assembly related to the external Auditor 
        (WHA 46.21), the Report of the Executive Board on the WHO 
        Response to Global Change (WHA 46.16) and actions for Budgetary 
        Reform (WHA 46.35); and
            (2) the effective and efficient utilization and monitoring 
        of resources, including--
                    (A) the determination of strategic and financial 
                priorities; and
                    (B) the establishment of realistic and measurable 
                targets in accordance with the established health 
                priorities.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and the Speaker of the House 
of Representatives a report assessing the World Health Organization's 
progress in implementing the reforms identified in subsection (a)(1) 
and (2).

SEC. 164. REFORMS IN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION.

    In view of the longstanding efforts of the United States and the 
other major donor nations to reform the Food and Agriculture 
Organization and in view of the findings of the ongoing investigation 
of the General Accounting Office, it is the sense of the Congress 
that--
            (1) the United States should use the opportunity of the 
        1993 election of a new Director General of the Food and 
        Agriculture Organization (FAO) to press for long-needed 
        organizational and management reforms; and
            (2) it should be the policy of the United States to promote 
        the following reforms in the Food and Agriculture Organization:
                    (A) Decentralization of the administrative 
                structure of FAO, including eliminating redundant or 
                unnecessary headquarters staff, increased 
                responsibilities of regional offices, increased time 
                for consideration of budget issues by member states, 
                and a more meaningful and direct role for member states 
                in the decision-making process.
                    (B) Reform of the FAO Council, including formation 
                of an executive management committee to provide 
                oversight of management.
                    (C) Limitation of the term of the Director General 
                and the number of terms which an individual may serve.
                    (D) Restructuring of the Technical Cooperation 
                Program (TCP), including reducing the number of 
                nonemergency projects funds through the TCP and 
                establishing procedures to deploy TCP consultants, 
                supplies, and equipment in a timely manner.

              NATIONS AND ITS SPECIALIZED AGENCIES.

to be appropriated by section 102(a) of this Act, the President may 
withhold 20 percent of the funds appropriated for the United States 
assessed contribution to the United Nations or to any of its

such agency has failed to implement or to continue to implement 
consensus-based decisionmaking procedures on budgetary matters which 
assure that sufficient attention is paid to the views of the United 
States and other member states that are the major financial 
contributors to such assessed budgets.
    (b) Notice to Congress.--The President shall notify the Congress 
when a decision is made to withhold any share of the United States

consultation between the President (or his representative) and the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.
    (c) Contributions for Prior Years.--Subject to the availability of 
appropriations, payment of assessed contributions for prior years may 
be made to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies 
notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, section 162(a) of the 
Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (Public 
Law 102-138), section 405 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246) and section 143 of the 
Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 (Public 
Law 99-93) if such payment would further United States interests in 
that organization.
    (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than February 1 of each year, 
the President shall submit a report to the Congress concerning the 
payment of assessed contributions to the United Nations and any of its 
specialized agencies during the preceding calendar year.

        relating to the administration of such operations and the 
        necessity for and progress of corrective action.
    (b) Advisory Committee.--An advisory committee established 
consistent with subsection (a) should be comprised of the permanent

each year thereafter at the time of the President's budget submission 
to Congress, the Secretary of State, after consultation with the heads 
of other relevant Federal agencies (including the Department of 
Defense), shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate 
a report on United States contributions to United Nations peacekeeping 
activities. Such report shall include--
            (1) the overall cost of all peacekeeping operations as of 
        the date of the report;
            (2) the costs of each peacekeeping operation;

SEC. 170. UNITED STATES PERSONNEL AND MATERIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
              PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS.

    (a) Personnel.--(1) The United Nations should reimburse the United 
States for use of personnel of the Armed Forces of the United States in 
United Nations peacekeeping operations. The amount of the reimbursement 
should be the full United Nations reimbursement determined on a per-
person-per-month basis.
    (2) To the extent that funds are made available under law to the 
Department of Defense for peacekeeping activities, the Secretary of 
State may accept the United Nations reimbursement in the form of a 
credit against the amount of an assessment by the United Nations 
against the United States. If no such funds are available, the 
Secretary of State shall accept payment of the United Nations 
reimbursement and, out of the amount received, reimburse the Department 
of Defense for the incremental costs of use of the Armed Forces 
personnel in the United Nations peacekeeping operation.
    (b) Goods and Services.--The United Nations should reimburse the 
Department of Defense directly for goods and services provided to a 
United Nations peacekeeping operation. The Secretary of Defense may 
waive reimbursement for such goods and services if the Secretary 
determines that the waiver is justified by exceptional circumstances.
    (c) Value of Goods and Services.--The Permanent Representative of 
the United States to the United Nations should use the voice and vote 
of the United States to ensure that goods and services provided by the 
United States to United Nations peacekeeping operations are reimbursed 
at the appropriate value.
    (d) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Permanent Representative of the United States to the 
United Nations shall submit a report to the Chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives on all actions taken by the United States mission to 
the United Nations to ensure that contributions of personnel, goods, 
and services to United Nations peacekeeping operations are reimbursed 
at their appropriate values.
    (e) Review and Reassessment of Assessed Contributions to United 
Nations Peacekeeping Operations.--(1) The Permanent Representative of 
the United States to the United Nations should make every effort to 
ensure the United Nations completes an overall review and reassessment 
of each nation's assessed contribution for international peacekeeping 
operations.
    (2) As part of the overall review and assessment, the Permanent 
Representative should make every effort to advance the concept that 
host governments and other governments in the region where a 
peacekeeping operation is deployed should bear a greater burden of its 
financial cost.
    (3) The Permanent Representative should further make every effort 
to seek a United States contribution to United Nations peacekeeping 
operations that matches the United States share of assessed 
contributions.

SEC. 170A. POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL 
              CRIMINAL COURT.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the freedom and security of the international community 
        rests on the sanctity of the rule of law;
            (2) the international community is increasingly threatened 
        by unlawful acts such as war crimes, genocide, aggression, 
        crimes against humanity, terrorism, drug trafficking, money 
        laundering, and other crimes of an international character;
            (3) the prosecution of individuals suspected of carrying 
        out such acts is often impeded by political and legal obstacles 
        such as amnesties, disputes over extradition, differences in 
        the structure and capabilities of national courts, and the lack 
        of uniform guidelines under which to try such individuals;
            (4) the war crimes trials held in the aftermath of World 
        War II at Nuremberg, Germany, and Tokyo, Japan, demonstrated 
        that fair and effective prosecution of war criminals could be 
        carried out in an international forum;
            (5) since its inception in 1945 the United Nations has 
        sought to build on the precedent established at the Nuremberg 
        and Tokyo trials by establishing a permanent international 
        criminal court with jurisdiction over crimes of an 
        international character;
            (6) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 44/39, 
        adopted on December 4, 1989, called on the International Law 
        Commission to study the feasibility of an international 
        criminal court;
            (7) in the years after passage of that resolution the 
        International Law Commission has taken a number of steps to 
        advance the debate over such a court, including--
                    (A) the provisional adoption of a draft Code of 
                Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind;
                    (B) the creation of a Working Group on an 
                International Criminal Jurisdiction and the formulation 
                by that Working Group of several concrete proposals for 
                the establishment and operation of an international 
                criminal court; and
                    (C) the determination that an international 
                criminal court along the lines of that suggested by the 
                Working Group is feasible and that the logical next 
                step would be to proceed with the formal drafting of a 
                statute for such a court;
            (8) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/33, 
        adopted on November 25, 1992, called on the International Law 
        Commission to begin the process of drafting a statute for an 
        international criminal court at its next session; and
            (9) given the developments of recent years, the time is 
        propitious for the United States to lend its support to this 
        effort.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the establishment of an international criminal court 
        with jurisdiction over crimes of an international character 
        would greatly strengthen the international rule of law;
            (2) such a court would thereby serve the interests of the 
        United States and the world community; and
            (3) the United States delegation should make every effort 
        to advance this proposal at the United Nations.
    (c) Required Report.--Not later than February 1, 1994, the 
President shall submit to Congress a detailed report on developments 
relating to, and United States efforts in support of, the establishment 
of an international criminal court with jurisdiction over crimes of an 
international character.

    (b) Policy.--Taking into consideration the long-term commitment by 
the United States to the affairs of this Hemisphere and the need to 
build further upon the linkages between the United States and its 
neighbors, it is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State,

SEC. 182. UNITED STATES POLICY CONCERNING OVERSEAS ASSISTANCE TO 
              REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS.

    (a) Standards for Refugee Women and Children.--The United States 
Government, in providing for overseas assistance and protection of 
refugees and displaced persons, should seek to address the protection 
and provision of basic needs of refugee women and children who 
represent 80 percent of the world's refugee population. As called for 
in the 1991 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
``Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women,'' whether directly, or 
through international organizations, the Secretary of State should seek 
to ensure--
            (1) specific attention on the part of the United Nations 
        and relief organizations to recruit and employ female 
        protection officers;
            (2) implementation of gender awareness training and field 
        staffing including, but not limited to, security personnel;
            (3) the protection of refugee women and children from 
        violence and other abuses on the part of governments or 
        insurgent groups;

        implementation of--
                    (A) the delivery of services and assistance; and

        birth spacing;
            (6) the availability of counseling and other services, 
        grievance processes, and protective services to victims of 
        violence and abuse, including but not limited to rape and 
        domestic violence;
            (7) the provision of educational programs, particularly 
        literacy and numeracy, vocational and income generation skills 
        training, and other training efforts promoting self sufficiency 
        for refugee women, with special emphasis on women heads of 
        household;
            (8) education for all refugee children, ensuring equal 
        access for girls, and special services and family tracing for 
        unaccompanied refugee minors;
            (9) the collection of data that clearly enumerate age and 
        gender so that appropriate health, education, and assistance 
        programs can be planned;
            (10) the recruitment, hiring, and training of more women 
        program professionals in the international humanitarian field; 
        and
            (11) gender awareness training for program staff of the 
        United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and 
        nongovernmental voluntary organizations on implementation of 
        the 1991 UNHCR ``Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee 
        Women''.
    (b) Procedures.--The Secretary of State should adopt specific 
procedures to ensure that all recipients of United States Government 
refugee and migration assistance funds implement the standards outlined 
in subsection (a).
    (c) Requirements for Refugee and Migration Assistance.--The 
Secretary of State, in providing migration and refugee assistance, 
should support the protection efforts set forth under this section by 
raising at the highest levels of Government the issue of abuses against 
refugee women and children by governments and insurgent groups that 
engage in, permit, or condone--
            (1) a pattern of gross violations of internationally 
        recognized human rights, such as torture or cruel, inhumane, or 
        degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention without 
        charges, or other flagrant denial to life, liberty, and the 
        security of persons;
            (2) the blockage of humanitarian relief assistance;
            (3) gender-specific persecution such as systematic 
        individual or mass rape, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, 
        enforced prostitution, any form of indecent assault or act of 
        violence against refugee women, girls, and children; or
            (4) continuing violations of the integrity of the person 
        against refugee women and children on the part of armed 
        insurgents, local security forces, or camp guards.
    (d) Investigation of Reports.--Upon receipt of credible reports of 
abuses under subsection (c), the Secretary of State should immediately 
investigate such reports through emergency factfinding missions or 
other means of investigating such reports and help identify appropriate 
remedial measures.
    (e) Multilateral Implementation of the 1991 UNHCR ``Guidelines on 
the Protection of Refugee Women''.--The Secretary of State should work 
to ensure that multilateral organizations fully incorporate the needs

programs and work to encourage other governments that provide refugee 
assistance to adopt refugee assistance policies designed to encourage 
full implementation of the UNHCR's ``Guidelines on the Protection of 
Refugee Women''.

        United States included;
            (2) international terrorist acts against the United States 
        or its people can only be combatted through a vigorous 
        coordination of efforts on the part of responsible United

        peoples of the world contributes to international peace and 
        stability, and that the promotion of such communication is in 
        the interests of the United States;
            (3) prominent in the implementation of this policy has been 
        United States support for the Voice of America, Radio Free 
        Europe, Radio Liberty, and Broadcasting to Cuba, which have 
        demonstrated their effectiveness in providing accurate and 
        timely information to the people of the world;
            (4) the continuation of these broadcasting entities, and 
        the creation of a new broadcasting service to the people of the 
        People's Republic of China and the other communist countries of 
        Asia, would continue the promotion of information and ideas, 
        while advancing the goals of United States foreign policy; and
            (5) the reorganization and consolidation of these services 
        under a single administrative structure will achieve important 
        economies and strengthen the capability of the United States to 
        utilize these instrumentalities to support freedom and 
        democracy in a rapidly changing international environment.

SEC. 309. PRESERVATION OF AMERICAN JOBS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the Director of the United 
States Information Agency and the Chairman of the Board for 
International Broadcasting should, in developing the plan for 
consolidation and reorganization of overseas international broadcasting

   TITLE IV--COMMISSION ON PROTECTING AND REDUCING GOVERNMENT SECRECY

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Protection and Reduction of 
Government Secrecy Act''.

SEC. 402. PURPOSE.

    It is the purpose of this title to establish for a two year period 
a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy which will 
examine the implications of the extensive classification of information 
and to make recommendations to reduce the volume of information 
classified and to thereby strengthen the protection of legitimately 
classified information.

SEC. 403. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) During the Cold War an extensive secrecy system 
        developed which limited the public's access to information and 
        reduced the ability of the public to participate with full 
        knowledge in the process of governmental decision-making;
            (2) In 1992 alone 6,349,532 documents were classified and 
        approximately three million persons held some form of security 
        clearance;
            (3) The burden of managing more than 6 million newly 
        classified documents every year has led to tremendous 
        administrative expense, reduced communication within the 
        government and within the scientific community, reduced 
        communication between the government and the people of the 
        United States, and the selective and unauthorized public 
        disclosure of classified information;
            (4) It has been estimated that private industries spend 
        over $14 billion per year implementing government mandated 
        regulations for protecting classified information;
            (5) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information was 
        classified the information could be held more securely;
            (6) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science 
        Board and headed by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that ``more 
        might be gained than lost if our Nation were to adopt--
        unilaterally, if necessary--a policy of complete openness in 
        all areas of information;'' and
            (7) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for 
        the purpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system 
        will be able to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.

SEC. 404. FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION.

    The functions of the Commission shall be--
            (1) to conduct, for not more than a period of 2 years, an 
        investigation into all matters in any way related to any 
        legislation, executive order, regulation, practice, or 
        procedure relating to the access to or the classification of 
        information or involving security clearances; and
            (2) to make such recommendations concerning the 
        classification of national security information as the 
        Commission shall deem necessary, including proposing new 
        legislation.

SEC. 405. COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION.

SEC. 709. UNITED STATES POLICY CONCERNING IRAQI KURDISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the international community, pursuant to United Nations 
        Security Council Resolution 688, and with the continuation of 
        Operation Provide Comfort, supports the protection of Iraqi's 
        Kurdish and other ethnic and religious minorities;
            (2) notwithstanding the international community's resolve, 
        certain areas of Iraqi Kurdistan remain at risk of an Iraqi 
        invasion;
            (3) despite the threat of an Iraqi invasion, the Kurds, 
        along with other minority ethnic and religious groups, have 
        initiated a drive toward self-sufficiency, including--
                    (A) holding free and fair democratic elections to 
                establish a parliament, which supports Iraq's 
                territorial integrity and the transition to a unified, 
                democratic Iraq;
                    (B) planning for and administering public services;
                    (C) reconstructing and rehabilitating the basic 
                infrastructure of Iraqi Kurdistan; and
                    (D) establishing unified police and security 
                forces;
            (4) despite the provision of substantial international 
        humanitarian assistance, and despite the fact that the United 
        Nations blockade on Iraq contains exceptions for humanitarian-
        related items, the inhabitants of Iraqi Kurdistan still face 
        difficulties because of an internal Iraqi government blockade; 
        and
            (5) the Kurds and other ethnic and religious minorities, 
        with appropriate additional support, would have the ability to 
        meet their goal of self-sufficiency and move beyond the need 
        for international assistance.
    (b) Policy.--It is the sense of the Congress that the President 
should--
            (1) take steps to encourage the United Nations Security 
        Council--
                    (A) to reaffirm support for the protection of all 
                Iraqi Kurdish and other minorities in Iraqi Kurdistan 
                pursuant to Security Council Resolution 688; and
                    (B) to consider lifting selectively the United 
                Nations embargo on the areas under the administration 
                of the democratically elected leadership of Iraqi 
                Kurdistan, subject to the verifiable conditions that--
                            (i) the inhabitants of such areas do not 
                        conduct trade with the Iraqi regime; and
                            (ii) the partial lifting of the embargo 
                        will not materially assist the Iraqi regime;
            (2) continue to advocate the transition to a unified, 
        democratic Iraq;
            (3) take steps to design a multilateral assistance program
