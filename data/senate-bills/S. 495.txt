SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States eliminated its stockpile of 
        biological weapons pursuant to the 1972 Biological Weapons 
        Convention and has pledged to destroy its entire inventory of 
        chemical weapons by 2004, independent of the Chemical Weapons 
        Convention entering into force;
            (2) the use of chemical or biological weapons in 
        contravention of international law is abhorrent and should 
        trigger immediate and effective sanctions;
            (3) United Nations Security Council Resolution 620, adopted 
        on August 26, 1988, states the intention of the Security 
        Council to consider immediately ``appropriate and effective'' 
        sanctions against any nation using chemical and biological 
        weapons in violation of international law;
            (4) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade recognizes 
        that national security concerns may serve as legitimate grounds 
        for limiting trade; title XXI of the General Agreement on 
        Tariffs and Trade states that ``nothing in this Agreement shall 
        be construed . . . to prevent any contracting party from taking 
        any action which it considers necessary for the protection of 
        its essential security interests. . .'';
            (5) on September 30, 1993, the President declared by 
        Executive Order No. 12868 a national emergency to deal with 
        ``the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
        security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States'' 
        posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical 
        weapons, and of the means for delivering such weapons;
            (6) Russia has not implemented the 1990 United States-
        Russian Bilateral Agreement on Destruction and Non-Production 
        of Chemical Weapons and on Measures to Facilitate the 
        Multilateral Convention on Banning Chemical Weapons, known as 
        the ``BDA'', nor has the United States and Russia resolved, to 
        the satisfaction of the United States, the outstanding 
        compliance issues under the Memorandum of Understanding Between 
        the United States of America and the Government of the Union of 
        Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral Verification 
        Experiment and Data Exchange Related To Prohibition on Chemical 
        Weapons, known as the ``1989 Wyoming MOU'';
            (7) the Intelligence Community has stated that a number of 
        countries, among them China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North 
        Korea, Syria, and Russia, possess chemical and biological 
        weapons and the means to deliver them;
            (8) four countries in the Middle East--Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
        and Syria--have, as a national policy, supported international 
        terrorism;
            (9) chemical and biological weapons have been used by 
        states in the past for intimidation and military aggression, 
        most recently during the Iran-Iraq war and by Iraq against its 
        Kurdish minority;
            (10) the grave new threat of chemical and biological 
        terrorism has been demonstrated by the 1995 nerve gas attack on 
        the Tokyo subway by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo;
            (11) the urgent need to improve domestic preparedness to 
        protect against chemical and biological threats was underscored 
        by enactment of the 1997 Defense Against Weapons of Mass 
        Destruction Act;
            (12) the Department of Defense, in light of growing 
        chemical and biological threats in regions of key concern, 
        including Northeast Asia, and the Middle East, has stated that 
        United States forces must be properly trained and equipped for 
        all missions, including those in which opponents might threaten 
        use of chemical or biological weapons; and
            (13) Australia Group controls on the exports of chemical 
        and biological agents, and related equipment, and the Missile 
        Technology Control Regime, together provide an indispensable 
        foundation for international and national efforts to curb the 
        spread of chemical and biological weapons, and their delivery 
        means.

SEC. 3. POLICY.

    It should be the policy of the United States to take all 
appropriate measures to--
            (1) prevent and deter the threat or use of chemical and 
        biological weapons against the citizens, Armed Forces, and 
        territory of the United States and its allies, and to protect 
        against, and manage the consequences of, such use should it 
        occur;
            (2) discourage the proliferation of chemical and biological 
        weapons, their means of delivery, and related equipment, 
        material, and technology;
            (3) prohibit within the United States the development, 
        production, acquisition, stockpiling, possession, and transfer 
        to third parties of chemical or biological weapons, their 
        precursors and related technology; and
            (4) impose unilateral sanctions, and seek immediately 
        international sanctions, against any nation using chemical and 
        biological weapons in violation of international law.

SEC. 202. CONTINUATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF MULTILATERAL CONTROL REGIMES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that any 
collapse of the informal forum of states known as the ``Australia 
Group'', either through changes in membership or lack of compliance 
with common export controls, or any substantial weakening of common 
Australia Group export controls and nonproliferation measures in force 
as of the date of enactment of this Act, would seriously undermine 
international and national efforts to curb the spread of chemical and 
biological weapons and related equipment.
    (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States--
            (1) to continue close cooperation with other countries in 
        the Australia Group in support of its current efforts and in 
        devising additional means to monitor and control the supply of 
        chemicals and biological agents applicable to weapons 
        production;
            (2) to maintain an equivalent or more comprehensive level 
        of control over the export of toxic chemicals and their 
        precursors, dual-use processing equipment, human, animal and 
        plant pathogens and toxins with potential biological weapons 
        application, and dual-use biological equipment, as that 
        afforded by the Australia Group as of the date of enactment of 
        this Act;
            (3) to block any effort by any Australia Group member to 
        achieve Australia Group consensus on any action that would 
        substantially weaken existing common Australia Group export 
        controls and nonproliferation measures or otherwise undermine 
        the effectiveness of the Australia Group; and
            (4) to work closely with other countries also capable of 
        supplying equipment, materials, and technology with particular 
        applicability to the production of chemical or biological 
        weapons in order to devise and harmonize the most effective 
        national controls possible on the transfer of such materials, 
        equipment, and technology.
    (c) Certification.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall 
determine and certify to Congress whether--
            (1) the Australia Group continues to maintain an equivalent 
        or more comprehensive level of control over the export of toxic 
        chemicals and their precursors, dual-use processing equipment, 
        human, animal, and plant pathogens and toxins with potential 
        biological weapons application, and dual-use biological 
        equipment, as that afforded by the Australia Group as of the 
        date of the last certification under this subsection, or, in 
        the case of the first certification, the level of control 
        maintained as of the date of enactment of this Act; and
            (2) the Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for 
        curtailing the spread of chemical and biological weapons-
        related materials and technology, and whether the effectiveness 
        of the Australia Group has been undermined by changes in 
        membership, lack of compliance with common export controls, or 
        any weakening of common controls and measures that are in 
        effect as of the date of enactment of this Act.
    (d) Consultations.--
            (1) In general.--The President shall consult periodically, 
        but not less frequently than twice a year, with the Committee 
        on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on 
        International Relations of the House of Representatives, on 
        Australia Group export controls and nonproliferation measures.
            (2) Resulting from presidential certification.--If the 
        President certifies that either of the conditions in subsection 
        (c) are not met, the President shall consult within 60 days of 
        such certification with the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
        the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the 
        House of Representatives on steps the United States should take 
        to maintain effective international controls on chemical and 
        biological weapons-related materials and technology.

    (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States--
            (1) to work to obtain multilateral agreement to effective, 
        international enforcement mechanisms to existing international 
        agreements that prohibit the use of chemical and biological 
        weapons, to which the United States is a state party; and
            (2) pursuant to paragraph (1), to work to obtain 
        multilateral agreement regarding the collective imposition of 
        sanctions and other measures described in title III of the

SEC. 207. ENHANCEMENTS TO ROBUST CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DEFENSES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the threats posed by chemical and biological weapons to 
        United States Armed Forces deployed in regions of concern will 
        continue to grow and will undermine United States strategies 
        for the projection of United States military power and the 
        forward deployment of United States Armed Forces;
            (2) the use of chemical or biological weapons will be a 
        likely condition of future conflicts in regions of concern;
            (3) it is essential for the United States and key regional 
        allies of the United States to preserve and further develop 
        robust chemical and biological defenses;
            (4) the United States Armed Forces, both active and 
        nonactive duty, are inadequately equipped, organized, trained, 
        and exercised for operations in chemically and biologically 
        contaminated environments;
            (5) the lack of readiness stems from a deemphasis by the 
        executive branch of Government and the United States Armed 
        Forces on chemical and biological defense;
            (6) the armed forces of key regional allies and likely 
        coalition partners, as well as civilians necessary to support 
        United States military operations, are inadequately prepared 
        and equipped to carry out essential missions in chemically and 
        biologically contaminated environments;
            (7) congressional direction contained in the 1997 Defense 
        Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act is intended to lead to 
        enhanced domestic preparedness to protect against the use of 
        chemical and biological weapons; and
            (8) the United States Armed Forces should place increased 
        emphasis on potential threats to deployed United States Armed 
        Forces and, in particular, should make countering the use of 
        chemical and biological weapons an organizing principle for 
        United States defense strategy and for the development of force 
        structure, doctrine, planning, training, and exercising 
        policies of the United States Armed Forces.
    (b) Defense Readiness Training.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
take those actions that are necessary to ensure that the United States 
Armed Forces are capable of carrying out required military missions in 
United States regional contingency plans despite the threat or use of 
chemical or biological weapons. In particular, the Secretary of Defense 
shall ensure that the United States Armed Forces are effectively 
equipped, organized, trained, and exercised (including at the large 
unit and theater level) to conduct operations in chemically and 
biologically contaminated environments that are critical to the success

SEC. 208. NEGATIVE SECURITY ASSURANCES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in order 
to achieve an effective deterrence against attacks of the United States 
and United States Armed Forces by chemical weapons, the President 
should reevaluate the extension of negative security assurances by the 
United States to nonnuclear-weapon states in the context of the Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the Committee on

to the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report, both in 
classified and unclassified forms, setting forth--
            (1) the findings of a detailed review of United States 
        policy on negative security assurances as a deterrence 
        strategy; and
            (2) a determination by the President of the appropriate 
        range of nuclear and conventional responses to the use of 
        chemical or biological weapons against the United States Armed 
        Forces, United States citizens, allies, and third parties.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Negative security assurances.--The term ``negative 
        security assurances'' means the assurances provided by the 
        United States to nonnuclear-weapon states in the context of the 
        Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 UST 483) 
        that the United States will forswear the use of certain weapons 
        unless the United States is attacked by that nonnuclear-weapon 
        state in alliance with a nuclear-weapon state.
            (2) Nonnuclear-weapon states.--The term ``nonnuclear-weapon 
        states'' means states that are not nuclear-weapon states, as 
        defined in Article IX(3) of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
        of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 
        1, 1968 (21 UST 483).

    (a) Prohibition.--The President shall not issue any order or 
directive that diminishes, abridges, or alters the right of the United 
States to use riot control agents--
            (1) in any circumstance not involving international armed 
        conflict; or
            (2) in a defensive military mode to save lives in an 
        international armed conflict, as provided for in Executive 
        Order No. 11850 of April 9, 1975.

        and
            (5) law enforcement operations and other internal 
        conflicts.
    (c) Defensive Military Mode.--The use of riot control agents under 
subsection (a)(2) may include the use of such agents--
            (1) in areas under direct and distinct United States 
        military control, including the use of such agents for the 
        purposes of controlling rioting or escaping enemy prisoners of 
        war;

international law permits the United States to use herbicides, under 
regulations applicable to their domestic use, for control of vegetation 
within United States bases and installations or around their immediate 
defensive perimeters.
    (e) Authority of the President.--The President shall take all 
necessary measures, and prescribe such rules and regulations as may be 
necessary, to ensure that the policy contained in this section is 
observed by the Armed Forces of the United States.
