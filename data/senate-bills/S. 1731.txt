        environmental, social, and economic stability of rural 
        communities;
            ``(2) private grazing land contains a complex set of 
        interactions among soil, water, air, plants, and animals;
            ``(3) grazing land constitutes the single largest watershed 
        cover type in the United States and contributes significantly 
        to the quality and quantity of water available for all of the 
        many uses of the land;
            ``(4) private grazing land constitutes the most extensive 
        wildlife habitat in the United States;
            ``(5) private grazing land can provide opportunities for 
        improved nutrient management from land application of animal 
        manures and other by-product nutrient resources;
            ``(6) owners and managers of private grazing land need to 
        continue to recognize conservation problems when the problems 
        arise and receive sound technical assistance to improve or 
        conserve grazing land resources to meet ecological and economic 
        demands;

        vital grazing land resources;

        experience to provide technical assistance, education, and 
        research to owners and managers of private grazing land for the 
        long-term productivity and ecological health of grazing land;
            ``(9) although competing demands on private grazing land 
        resources are greater than ever before, assistance to private 
        owners and managers of private grazing land is limited and does 
        not meet the demand and basic need for adequately sustaining or 
        enhancing the private grazing land resources; and
            ``(10) private grazing land can be enhanced to provide many 
        benefits to all citizens of the United States through voluntary 
        cooperation among owners and managers of the land, local

Secretary to provide a coordinated technical, educational, and related

SEC. 326. EXPORTER ASSISTANCE INITIATIVE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress find that--
            (1) information in the possession of Federal agencies other 
        than the Department of Agriculture that is necessary for the 
        export of agricultural commodities and products is available 
        only from multiple disparate sources; and
            (2) because exporters often need access to information 
        quickly, exporters lack the time to search multiple sources to 
        access necessary information, and exporters often are unaware 
        of where the necessary information can be located.

U.S.C. 5601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 107. EXPORTER ASSISTANCE INITIATIVE.

    ``(a) In General.--In order to create a single source of 
information for exports of United States agricultural commodities, the 
Secretary shall develop a website on the Internet that collates onto a 
single website all information from all agencies of the Federal 
Government that is relevant to the export of United States agricultural 
commodities.

SEC. 336. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL TRADE.

    (a) Agriculture Trade Negotiating Objectives.--It is the sense of 
Congress that the principal negotiating objective of the United States 
with respect to agricultural trade in all multilateral, regional, and 
bilateral negotiations is to obtain competitive opportunities for the 
export of United States agricultural commodities in foreign markets 
substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded 
foreign exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and more 
open conditions of agricultural trade in bulk and value-added 
commodities by--
            (1) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or 
        other charges that decrease market opportunities for the export 
        of United States agricultural commodities, giving priority to 
        United States agricultural commodities that are subject to 
        significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major 
        producing countries;
            (2) immediately eliminating all export subsidies on 
        agricultural commodities worldwide while maintaining bona fide 
        food aid and preserving United States agricultural market 
        development and export credit programs that allow the United 
        States to compete with other foreign export promotion efforts;
            (3) leveling the playing field for United States 
        agricultural producers by disciplining domestic supports such 
        that no other country can provide greater support, measured as 
        a percentage of total agricultural production value, than the 
        United States does while preserving existing green box category 
        to support conservation activities, family farms, and rural 
        communities;
            (4) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules and 
        effective dispute settlement mechanisms to eliminate practices 
        that unfairly decrease United States market access 
        opportunities for United States agricultural commodities or 
        distort agricultural markets to the detriment of the United 
        States, including--
                    (A) unfair or trade-distorting activities of state 
                trading enterprises and other administrative 
                mechanisms, with emphasis on--
                            (i) requiring price transparency in the 
                        operation of state trading enterprises and such 
                        other mechanisms; and
                            (ii) ending discriminatory pricing 
                        practices for agricultural commodities that 
                        amount to de facto export subsidies so that the 
                        enterprises or other mechanisms do not (except 
                        in cases of bona fide food aid) sell 
                        agricultural commodities in foreign markets at 
                        prices below domestic market prices or prices 
                        below the full costs of acquiring and 
                        delivering agricultural commodities to the 
                        foreign markets;
                    (B) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial 
                requirements affecting new agricultural technologies, 
                including biotechnology;
                    (C) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary 
                restrictions, including restrictions that are not based 
                on scientific principles, in contravention of the 
                Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and 
                Phytosanitary Measures (as described in section 
                101(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 
                U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));
                    (D) other unjustified technical barriers to 
                agricultural trade; and
                    (E) restrictive and nontransparent rules in the 
                administration of tariff rate quotas;
            (5) improving import relief mechanisms to recognize the 
        unique characteristics of perishable agricultural commodities;
            (6) taking into account whether a party to negotiations 
        with respect to trading in an agricultural commodity has--
                    (A) failed to adhere to the provisions of an 
                existing bilateral trade agreement with the United 
                States;
                    (B) circumvented obligations under a multilateral 
                trade agreement to which the United States is a 
                signatory; or
                    (C) manipulated its currency value to the detriment 
                of United States agricultural producers or exporters; 
                and
            (7) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the 
        World Trade Organization--
                    (A) have made meaningful market liberalization 
                commitments in agriculture; and
                    (B) make progress in fulfilling those commitments 
                over time.
    (b) Priority for Agriculture Trade.--It is the sense of Congress 
that--
            (1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should 
        be the top priority of United States negotiators in World Trade 
        Organization talks; and
            (2) if the primary export competitors of the United States 
        fail to reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and 
        eliminate export subsidies in accordance with the negotiating 
        objectives expressed in this section, the United States should 
        take steps to increase the leverage of United States 
        negotiators and level the playing field for United States 
        producers, within existing World Trade Organization 
        commitments.
    (c) Consultation with Congressional Committees.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) before the United States Trade Representative 
        negotiates a trade agreement that would reduce tariffs on 
        agricultural commodities or require a change in United States 
        agricultural law, the United States Trade Representative should 
        consult with the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on 
        Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the 
        Committee on Finance of the Senate;
            (2) not less than 48 hours before initialing an agreement 
        relating to agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices of 
        the World Trade Organization, the United States Trade 
        Representative should consult closely with the committees 
        referred to in paragraph (1) regarding--
                    (A) the details of the agreement;
                    (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United 
                States agricultural producers; and
                    (C) any changes in United States law necessary to 
                implement the agreement; and
            (3) any agreement or other understanding (whether verbal or 
        in writing) that relates to agricultural trade that is not 
        disclosed to Congress before legislation implementing a trade 
        agreement is introduced in either the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives should not be considered to be part of the 
        agreement approved by Congress and should have no force and 
        effect under Unites States law or in any dispute settlement 
        body.

                hunger; and
                    (B) a need for those individuals to initiate and 
                administer solutions to the hunger problem;
            (2) Bill Emerson, the distinguished late Representative 
        from the 8th District of Missouri, demonstrated--
                    (A) his commitment to solving the problem of hunger 
                in a bipartisan manner;
                    (B) his commitment to public service; and

                ideals of Congress;
            (3) George T. (Mickey) Leland, the distinguished late

        inspiration for others to work toward the goals of equality and 
        justice for all; and

        worked together to encourage future leaders to recognize and 
        provide service to others, it is especially appropriate to

SEC. 797. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOUBLING OF FUNDING FOR 
              AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Federal funding for food and agricultural research has 
        been essentially constant for 2 decades, putting at risk the 
        scientific base on which food and agricultural advances have 
        been made;
            (2) the resulting increase in the relative proportion of 
        private sector, industry investments in food and agricultural 
        research has led to questions about the independence and 
        objectivity of research and outreach conducted by the Federal 
        and university research sectors; and
            (3) funding for food and agricultural research should be at 
        least doubled over the next 5 fiscal years--
                    (A) to restore the balance between public and 
                private sector funding for food and agricultural 
                research; and
                    (B) to maintain the scientific base on which food 
                and agricultural advances are made.

SEC. 806. SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings and Purposes.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the United States is becoming increasingly 
                dependent on nonindustrial private forest land to 
                supply necessary market commodities and nonmarket 
                conservation values;
                    (B) there is a strong demand for expanded 
                assistance programs for owners of nonindustrial private 
                forest land because the majority of the wood supply of 
                the United States comes from nonindustrial private 
                forest land;
                    (C) soil, water, and air quality, fish and wildlife 
                habitat, aesthetic values, and opportunities for 
                outdoor recreation in the United States would be 
                maintained and improved through good stewardship of 
                nonindustrial private forest land;
                    (D) the products and services resulting from 
                stewardship of nonindustrial private forest land 
                contribute to the economic, social, and ecological 
                health and diversity of rural communities;
                    (E) catastrophic wildfires threaten human lives, 
                property, forests, and other resources;
                    (F) Federal and State cooperation in forest fire 
                prevention and control has proven effective and 
                valuable because properly managed forest stands are 
                less susceptible to catastrophic fire, as demonstrated 
                by the catastrophic fire seasons of 1998 and 2000;
                    (G) owners of nonindustrial private forest land 
                face increased pressure to make that land available for 
                development and other uses, resulting in forest land 
                loss and fragmentation that reduces the ability of 
                private forest land to provide a full range of societal 
                benefits;
                    (H) complex investments in the management of long-
                rotation forest stands, including sustainable hardwood 
                management, are often the most difficult commitments 
                for owners of nonindustrial private forest land;
                    (I) the investment of a single Federal dollar in 
                State and private forestry programs is estimated to 
                leverage, on the average, $9 from State, local, and 
                private sources; and
                    (J) comprehensive, multiresource planning 
                assistance made available to each landowner before the 
                provision of technical assistance would provide an 
                opportunity to ensure that the landowner is aware of 
                the many projects and activities eligible for cost-
                share assistance.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
                    (A) to strengthen the commitment of the Secretary 
                to sustainable forest management to enhance the 
                productivity of timber, fish and wildlife habitat, soil 
                and water quality, wetland, recreational resources, and 
                aesthetic values of forest land; and
                    (B) to establish a coordinated and cooperative 
                Federal, State, and local sustainable forestry program 
                for the establishment, management, maintenance, 
                enhancement, and restoration of forests on 
                nonindustrial private forest land.
    (b) Program.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is 
amended by inserting after section 6 (16 U.S.C. 2103b) the following:

``SEC. 6A. SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:

SEC. 807. FOREST FIRE RESEARCH CENTERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) there is an increasing threat of fire to millions of 
        acres of forest land and rangeland throughout the United 
        States;
            (2) this threat is especially great in the interior States 
        of the western United States, where the Forest Service 
        estimates that 39,000,000 acres of National Forest System land 
        are at high risk of catastrophic wildfire;
            (3)(A) the degraded condition of forest land and rangeland 
        is often the consequence of land management practices that 
        emphasize the control and prevention of fires; and
            (B) the land management practices disrupted the occurrence 
        of frequent low-intensity fires that periodically remove 
        flammable undergrowth;
            (4) as a result of the land management practices--
                    (A) some forest land and rangeland in the United 
                States no longer function naturally as ecosystems; and
                    (B) drought cycles and the invasion of insects and 
                disease have resulted in vast areas of dead or dying 
                trees, overstocked stands, and the invasion of 
                undesirable species;
            (5)(A) population movement into wildland-urban interface 
        areas exacerbate the fire danger;
            (B) the increasing number of larger, more intense fires 
        pose grave hazards to human health, safety, property, and 
        infrastructure in the areas; and
            (C) smoke from wildfires, which contain fine particulate 
        matter and other hazardous pollutants, pose substantial health 
        risks to people living in the areas;
            (6)(A) the budgets and resources of Federal, State, and 
        local entities supporting firefighting efforts have been 
        stretched to their limits;
            (B) according to the Comptroller General, the average cost 
        of attempting to put out fires in the interior West grew by 150 
        percent, from $134,000,000 in fiscal year 1986 to $335,000,000 
        in fiscal year 1994; and
            (C) the costs of preparedness, including the costs of 
        maintaining a readiness force to fight fires, rose about 70 
        percent, from $189,000,000 in fiscal year 1992 to $326,000,000 
        in fiscal year 1997;
            (7) diminishing Federal resources (including the 
        availability of personnel) have limited the ability of Federal 
        fire researchers--
                    (A) to respond to management needs; and
                    (B) to use technological advancements for analyzing 
                fire management costs;
            (8) the Federal fire research program is funded at 
        approximately \1/3\ of the amount that is required to address 
        emerging fire problems, resulting in the lack of a cohesive 
        strategy to address the threat of catastrophic wildfires; and
            (9) there is a critical need for cost-effective investments 
        in improved fire management technologies.
    (b) Forest Fire Research Centers.--The Forest and Rangeland 
Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 11. FOREST FIRE RESEARCH CENTERS.

    ``(a) In General.--Subject to the availability of appropriations, 
the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest 
Service (referred to in this section as the `Secretary') shall 
establish at least 2 forest fire research centers at institutions of 
higher education (which may include research centers in existence on 
the date of enactment of this section) that--
            ``(1) have expertise in natural resource development; and
            ``(2) are located in close proximity to other Federal 
        natural resource, forest management, and land management 
        agencies.
    ``(b) Locations.--Of the forest fire research centers established 
under subsection (a)--
            ``(1) at least 1 center shall be located in Arizona, 
        California, New Mexico, Oregon, or Washington; and
            ``(2) at least 1 center shall be located in Colorado, 
        Idaho, Montana, Nevada, or Wyoming.
    ``(c) Duties.--At each of the forest fire research centers 
established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall provide for--
            ``(1) the conduct of integrative, interdisciplinary 
        research into the ecological, socioeconomic, and environmental 
        impact of fire control and the use of management of ecosystems 
        and landscapes to facilitate fire control; and
            ``(2) the development of mechanisms to rapidly transfer new 
        fire control and management technologies to fire and land 
        managers.
    ``(d) Advisory Committee.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the 
        Secretary of the Interior, shall establish a committee composed 
        of fire and land managers and fire researchers to determine the 
        areas of emphasis and establish priorities for research 
        projects conducted at forest fire research centers established 
        under subsection (a).
            ``(2) Administration.--The Federal Advisory Committee Act 
        (5 U.S.C. App.) and section 102 of the Agricultural Research, 
        Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (7 U.S.C. 7612) 
        shall not apply to the committee established under paragraph

    ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this section.''.

SEC. 808. WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND HAZARDOUS FUEL PURCHASE PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the damage caused by wildfire disasters has been 
        equivalent in magnitude to the damage resulting from the 
        Northridge earthquake, Hurricane Andrew, and the recent 
        flooding of the Mississippi River and the Red River;
            (2) more than 20,000 communities in the United States are 
        at risk from wildfire and approximately 11,000 of those 
        communities are located near Federal land;
            (3) the accumulation of heavy forest fuel loads continues 
        to increase as a result of disease, insect infestations, and 
        drought, further increasing the risk of fire each year;
            (4) modification of forest fuel load conditions through the 
        removal of hazardous fuels would--
                    (A) minimize catastrophic damage from wildfires;
                    (B) reduce the need for emergency funding to 
                respond to wildfires; and
                    (C) protect lives, communities, watersheds, and 
                wildlife habitat;
            (5) the hazardous fuels removed from forest land represent 
        an abundant renewable resource, as well as a significant supply 
        of biomass for biomass-to-energy facilities;
            (6) the United States should invest in technologies that 
        promote economic and entrepreneurial opportunities in 
        processing forest products removed through hazardous fuel 
        reduction activities; and
            (7) the United States should--
                    (A) develop and expand markets for traditionally 
                underused wood and other biomass as an outlet for 
                value-added excessive forest fuels; and
                    (B) commit resources to support planning, 
                assessments, and project reviews to ensure that 
                hazardous fuels management is accomplished 
                expeditiously and in an environmentally sound manner.
    (b) Wildfire Prevention and Hazardous Fuel Purchase Program.--The 
Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is amended by inserting

SEC. 809. ENHANCED COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the severity and intensity of wildfires have increased 
        dramatically over the past few decades as a result of past fire 
        and land management policies;
            (2) the record 2000 fire season is a prime example of what 
        can be expected if action is not taken to reduce the risk of 
        catastrophic wildfires;
            (3) wildfires threaten not only the forested resources of 
        the United States, but also the thousands of communities 
        intermingled with wildland in the wildland-urban interface;
            (4) wetland forests provide essential ecological services, 
        such as filtering pollutants, buffering important rivers and 
        estuaries, and minimizing flooding, that make the protection 
        and restoration of those forests worthy of special focus;
            (5) the National Fire Plan, if implemented to achieve 
        appropriate priorities, is the proper, coordinated, and most 
        effective means to address the issue of wildfires;
            (6) while adequate authorities exist to address the problem 
        of wildfires at the landscape level on Federal land, there is 
        limited authority to take action on most private land where the 
        largest threat to life and property lies; and
            (7) there is a significant Federal interest in enhancing 
        the protection of communities from wildfire.
    (b) Enhanced Community Fire Protection.--The Cooperative Forestry 
Assistance Act of 1978 is amended by inserting after section 10 (16 
U.S.C. 2106) the following:

``SEC. 10A. ENHANCED COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION.

    ``(a) Cooperative Management Relating to Wildfire Threats.--
Notwithstanding section 7 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control 
Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2206), the Secretary may cooperate with State 
foresters and equivalent State officials to--
            ``(1) assist in the prevention, control, suppression, and 
        prescribed use of fires (including through the provision of 
        financial, technical, and related assistance);
            ``(2) protect communities from wildfire threats;
            ``(3) enhance the growth and maintenance of trees and 
        forests in a manner that promotes overall forest health; and
            ``(4) ensure the continued production of all forest 
        resources, including timber, outdoor recreation opportunities, 
        wildlife habitat, and clean water, through conservation of 
        forest cover on watersheds, shelterbelts, and windbreaks.
    ``(b) Community and Private Land Fire Assistance Program.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a program 
        to be known as the `community and private land fire assistance 
        program' (referred to in this section as the `Program')--
                    ``(A) to focus the Federal role in promoting 
                optimal firefighting efficiency at the Federal, State, 
                and local levels;
                    ``(B) to provide increased assistance to Federal 
                projects that establish landscape level protection from 
                wildfires;
                    ``(C) to expand outreach and education programs 
                concerning fire prevention to homeowners and 
                communities; and
                    ``(D) to establish defensible space against 
                wildfires around the homes and property of private

each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006.''.

SEC. 810. WATERSHED FORESTRY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) there has been a dramatic shift in public attitudes and 
        perceptions about forest management, particularly in the 
        understanding and practice of sustainable forest management;
            (2) it is commonly recognized that proper stewardship of 
        forest land is essential to--
                    (A) sustain and restore watershed health;
                    (B) produce clean water; and
                    (C) maintain healthy aquatic systems;
            (3) forests are increasingly important to the protection 
        and sustainability of drinking water supplies for more than 1/2 
        of the population of the United States;
            (4) forest loss and fragmentation in urbanizing areas are 
        contributing to flooding, degradation of urban stream habitat 
        and water quality, and public health concerns;
            (5) scientific evidence and public awareness with respect 
        to the manner in which forest management can positively affect 
        water quality and quantity, and the manner in which trees, 
        forests, and forestry practices (such as forest buffers) can 
        serve as solutions to water quality problems in rural and urban 
        areas, are increasing;
            (6) the application of forestry best management practices 
        developed at the State level has been found to greatly 
        facilitate the achievement of water quality goals;
            (7) significant efforts are underway to revisit and make 
        improvements on needed forestry best management practices;
            (8) according to the report of the Forest Service numbered 
        FS-660 and entitled ``Water and the Forest Service'', forests 
        are a requirement for maintenance of clean water because--
                    (A) approximately 66 percent of the freshwater 
                resources of the United States originate on forests; 
                and
                    (B) forests cover approximately 1/3 of the land 
                area of the United States;
            (9) because almost 500,000,000 acres, or approximately 2/3, 
        of the forest land of the United States is owned by non-Federal 
        entities, a significant burden is placed on private forest 
        landowners to provide or maintain the clean water needed by the 
        public for drinking, swimming, fishing, and a number of other 
        water uses;
            (10) because the decisions made by individual landowners 
        and communities will affect the ability to maintain the health 
        of rural and urban watersheds in the future, there is a need to 
        integrate forest management, conservation, restoration, and 
        stewardship in watershed management;
            (11) although water management is the primary 
        responsibility of States, the Federal Government has a 
        responsibility to promote and encourage the ability of States 
        and private forest landowners to sustain the delivery of clean, 
        abundant water from forest land;
            (12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the 
        availability of Federal assistance to support forest landowners 
        to achieve the water goals identified in many Federal laws 
        (including regulations) is lacking; and
            (13) increased research for, education for, and technical 
        and financial assistance provided to, forest landowners and 
        communities that relate to the protection of watersheds and 
        improvement of water quality, are needed to realize the 
        expectations of the general public for clean water and healthy 
        aquatic systems.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--
            (1) improve the understanding of landowners and the public 
        with respect to the relationship between water quality and 
        forest management;
            (2) encourage landowners to maintain tree cover and use 
        tree plantings and vegetative treatments as creative solutions 
        to water quality and quantity problems associated with varying 
        land uses;
            (3) enhance and complement source water protection in 
        watersheds that provide drinking water for municipalities;
            (4) establish new partnerships and collaborative watershed 
        approaches to forest management, stewardship, and protection; 
        and
            (5) provide technical and financial assistance to States to 
        deliver a coordinated program that through the provision of 
        technical, financial, and educational assistance to qualified 
        individuals and entities--
                    (A) enhances State forestry best management 
                practices programs; and
                    (B) protects and improves water quality on forest 
                land.
    (c) Program.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is 
amended by inserting after section 5A (as added by section 805) the 
following:

``SEC. 5B. WATERSHED FORESTRY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

                            TITLE IX--ENERGY

SEC. 901. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) there are many opportunities for the agricultural 
        sector and rural areas to produce renewable energy and increase 
        energy efficiency;
            (2) investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency--
                    (A) enhance the energy security and independence of 
                the United States;
                    (B) increase farmer and rancher income;
                    (C) promote rural economic development;
                    (D) provide environmental and public health 
                benefits such as cleaner air and water; and
                    (E) improve electricity grid reliability, thereby 
                reducing the likelihood of blackouts and brownouts, 
                particularly during peak usage periods;
            (3) the public strongly supports renewable energy 
        generation and energy efficiency improvements as an important 
        component of a national energy strategy;
            (4)(A) the Federal Government is the country's largest 
        consumer of a vast array of products, spending in excess of 
        $200,000,000,000 per year;
            (B) purchases and use of products by the Federal Government 
        have a significant effect on the environment; and
            (C) accordingly, the Federal Government should lead the way 
        in purchasing biobased products so as to minimize environmental 
        impacts while supporting domestic producers of biobased 
        products;
            (5) the agricultural sector is a leading producer of 
        biobased products to meet domestic and international needs;
            (6) agriculture can play a significant role in the 
        development of fuel cell and hydrogen-based energy 
        technologies, which are critical technologies for a clean 
        energy future;
            (7)(A) wind energy is 1 of the fastest growing clean energy 
        technologies; and
            (B) there are tremendous economic development and 
        environmental quality benefits to be achieved by developing 
        both large-scale and small-scale wind power projects on farms 
        and in rural communities;
            (8) farm-based renewable energy generation can become one 
        of the major cash crops of the United States, improving the 
        livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of family farmers, 
        ranchers, and others and revitalizing rural communities;
            (9)(A) evidence continues to mount that increases in 
        atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are contributing 
        to global climate change; and
            (B) agriculture can help in climate change mitigation by--
                    (i) storing carbon in soils, plants, and forests;
                    (ii) producing biofuels, chemicals, and power to 
                replace fossil fuels and petroleum-based products; and
                    (iii) reducing emissions by capturing gases from 
                animal feeding operations, changing agricultural land 
                practices, and becoming more energy efficient;
            (10) because agricultural production is energy-intensive, 
        it is incumbent on the Federal Government to aid the 
        agricultural sector in reducing energy consumption and energy 
        costs;
            (11)(A) one way to help farmers, ranchers, and others 
        reduce energy use is through professional energy audits;
            (B) energy audits provide recommendations for improved 
        energy efficiency that, when acted on, offer an effective means 
        of reducing overall energy use and saving money; and
            (C) energy savings of 10 to 30 percent can typically be 
        achieved, and greater savings are often realized;
            (12) rural electric utilities are often geographically well 
        situated to develop renewable and distributed energy supplies, 
        enabling the utilities to diversify their energy portfolios and 
        afford their members or customers alternative energy sources, 
        which many such members and customers desire;
            (13) fuel cells are a highly efficient, clean, and flexible 
        technology for generating electricity from hydrogen that 
        promises to improve the environment, electricity reliability, 
        and energy security;
            (14)(A) because fuel cells can be made in any size, fuel 
        cells can be used for a wide variety of farm applications, 
        including powering farm vehicles, equipment, houses, and other 
        operations; and
            (B) much of the initial use of fuel cells is likely to be 
        in remote and off-grid applications in rural areas; and
            (15) hydrogen is a clean and flexible fuel that can play a 
        critical role in storing and transporting energy produced on 
        farms from renewable sources (including biomass, wind, and 
        solar energy).

SEC. 905. CARBON SEQUESTRATION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity 
        present potential risks and potential opportunities for 
        agricultural and forestry production;
            (2) there is a need to identify cost-effective methods that 
        can be used in the agricultural and forestry sectors to reduce 
        the threat of climate change;
            (3) deforestation and other land use changes account for 
        approximately 1,600,000,000 of the 7,900,000,000 metric tons of 
        the average annual worldwide quantity of carbon emitted during 
        the 1990s;
            (4) ocean and terrestrial systems each sequestered 
        approximately 2,300,000,000 metric tons of carbon annually, 
        resulting in a sequestration of 60 percent of the annual human-
        induced emissions of carbon during the 1990s;
            (5) there are opportunities for increasing the quantity of 
        carbon that can be stored in terrestrial systems through 
        improved, human-induced agricultural and forestry practices;
            (6) increasing the carbon content of soil helps to reduce 
        erosion, reduce flooding, minimize the effects of drought, 
        prevent nutrients and pesticides from washing into water 
        bodies, and contribute to water infiltration, air and water 
        holding capacity, and good seed germination and plant growth;
            (7) tree planting and wetland restoration could play a 
        major role in sequestering carbon and reducing greenhouse gas 
        concentrations in the atmosphere;
            (8) nitrogen management is a cost-effective method of 
        addressing nutrient overenrichment in the estuaries of the 
        United States and of reducing emissions of nitrous oxide;
            (9) animal feed and waste management can be cost-effective 
        methods to address water quality issues and reduce emissions of 
        methane; and
            (10) there is a need to--
                    (A) demonstrate that carbon sequestration in soils, 
                plants, and forests and reductions in greenhouse gas 
                emissions through nitrogen and animal feed and waste 
                management can be measured and verified; and
                    (B) develop and refine quantification, 
                verification, and auditing methodologies for carbon 
                sequestration and greenhouse gas emission reductions on 
                a project by project basis.
