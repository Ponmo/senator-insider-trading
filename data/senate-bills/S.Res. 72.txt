                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for the nation and people of Japan and deepest 
condolences for the losses suffered as the result of the earthquake of 
                           January 17, 1995.

Whereas on the morning of January 17, 1995 a devastating and deadly earthquake 
        shook the cities of Kobe and Osaka, Japan killing more than 5,000 people 
        injuring more than 25,000 and leaving more than 300,000 temporarily 
        homeless;
Whereas the earthquake of January 17, 1995 has left more than 46,440 buildings 
        in ruin, destroyed highways, train lines and other infrastructure and 
        has caused losses of as much as $80 billion in Kobe alone;
Whereas the tradition of strength, courage, determination, and community of the 
        people of Japan has been displayed time again by the citizens of Kobe 
        and Osaka and, indeed, all of Japan since the earthquake and has served 
        as an inspiration to all of the world;
Whereas the nations and people of the United States and Japan share a strong, 
        decades old history of friendship and mutual interests and respect; and
Whereas the people of the United States, having suffered a similar tragedy 
        almost a year ago to the day of the Kobe and Osaka earthquake, share in 
        the pain and hope of the people of Japan: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,
            (1) The Senate expresses its deepest sympathies to the 
        nation of Japan and the citizens of Kobe and Osaka for the 
        tragic losses suffered as a result of the earthquake of January 
        17, 1995.
            (2) The Senate expresses its support to the people of Japan 
        as they continue their noble efforts to rebuild their cities 
        and their lives.
            (3) The Senate expresses its friendship to the people of 
        Kobe and Osaka and pledges its support for their efforts in the 
        face of this disaster.
                                 <all>
