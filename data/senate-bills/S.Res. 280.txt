                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the tragic crash of TWA 
                              flight 800.

Whereas, on July 17, 1996, Trans World Airlines flight 800 tragically crashed en 
        route from New York to Paris, France, creating a tremendous and tragic 
        loss of life estimated at 229 men, women, and children;
Whereas, according to Daniel L. Chandler, principal of Montoursville, 
        Pennsylvania, High School, among those traveling on board this airplane 
        were 16 members of the Montoursville High School French Club, who were 
        among the very best students of the French language at their school, and 
        their five adult chaperones, who generously devoted their time to making 
        possible this planned three-week French Club trip to visit Paris and the 
        French provinces;
Whereas the actual cause of the airplane crash is as of yet unknown; and
Whereas the Federal Government is investigating the case of this tragedy: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate of the United States--
            (1) expresses its condolences to the families, friends and 
        loved ones of those whose lives were taken away by this tragic 
        occurrence; and
            (2) expresses its sincere hope that the cause of this 
        tragedy will be determined through a thorough investigation as 
        soon as possible.
