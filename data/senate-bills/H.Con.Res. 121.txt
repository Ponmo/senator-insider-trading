 basis and do not reduce the demand for credit.
 (b) BUDGETARY TREATMENT- For purposes of allocations and points of order
 under sections 302, 311, 601, 602, and 605 of the Congressional Budget and
 Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the amounts realized from asset sales or

 (2) the terms `asset sale' and `prepayment of a loan' do not include asset

 sales and loan prepayments at levels consistent with agency operations in
 fiscal year 1986.

 (a) SENSE OF THE SENATE- It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in

 more gradual period of transition to the changes in benefit computation
 rules enacted in the Social Security amendments of 1977 as such changes
 apply to workers born in years after 1916 and before 1927 (and related
 beneficiaries), or any other legislation affecting these levels in section
 5, that such legislation shall include other changes to Social Security
 outlays and revenues to ensure that the annual Social Security surpluses
 that accrue to the Social Security Trust Fund are not reduced.
 (b) ACCOUNTING TREATMENT- Notwithstanding any other provision of this
 resolution, for the purpose of allocations and points of order under
 sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the levels
 of Social Security outlays and revenues for this resolution shall be the
 baseline levels.
 (c) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this section--
 (1) the terms `Social Security revenues' and `Social Security outlays'
 shall have the same meaning as under title III of the Congressional Budget
 and Impoundment Control Act of 1974; and
 (2) no provision of any bill or resolution, or any amendment thereto or
 conference report thereon, involving a change in chapter 1 of the Internal
 Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as affecting the amount of Social
 Security revenues unless such provision changes the income tax treatment
 of Social Security benefits.
