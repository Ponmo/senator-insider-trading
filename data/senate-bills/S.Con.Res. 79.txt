One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Concurrent Resolution
Whereas, a ceasefire has been in effect in Nicaragua for eighteen months;
Whereas, although there have been periodic violent incidents, and accusations
of violations of the ceasefire by each side against the other, there has
been no major, widespread breakdown in the ceasefire to date;
Whereas, United States policy has been to discourage the Contras from
undertaking any offensive military actions, and we have withheld American
aid from Contra units which have initiated such actions;
Whereas, on October 28, Daniel Ortega announced the Sandinista regime's
intention to unilaterally end the ceasefire;
Whereas, Ortega's announcement was made at a hemispheric meeting held in
Costa Rica to celebrate democracy in the region--another instance in which
Ortega and other Sandinista leaders have shown disregard for their democratic
neighbors and their own commitments;
Whereas, many of the democratic leaders of the hemisphere, including Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias, have already denounced Ortega's announcement;
Whereas, many observers are concerned that Ortega's announcement could be
the prelude to a Sandinista effort to cancel or postpone elections scheduled
to be held in February 1990;
Whereas, despite incidents of Sandinista intimidation and harassment, and
the fact that the voter registration period was limited to four Sundays in
October, nearly two million Nicaraguans registered to vote in the February
1990 elections; and
Whereas, in the Bipartisan Accord on Nicaragua and Public Law 101-14, the
Congress indicated its intention to provide humanitarian assistance to the
Contras until after the February 1990 elections: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That
 the Congress--
 (1) condemns Daniel Ortega's announced intention to abrogate the ceasefire
 they originally declared in Nicaragua as totally unjustified, a major breach
 of the Sandinista regime's commitments to its democratic neighbors and its
 own people, and a serious threat to regional peace and stability;
 (2) calls on Daniel Ortega to cease his reckless rhetoric, and to begin
 to fulfill the many commitments he and his regime have made to end their
 aggression in the region, end their tyranny over their own people, and
 permit the establishment of democracy inside Nicaragua;
 (3) urges the Sandinistas to renew their commitment to continuing the
 ceasefire now in effect;
 (4) insists that Ortega and the Sandinistas reaffirm their pledge to hold
 elections on February 25, 1990, and to begin to carry out in good faith their
 commitment to a free and fair electoral process leading up to those elections;
 (5) deplores any effort by the Sandinista regime to terminate, postpone or
 curtail the limited progress they have made to date in fulfilling their
 commitment to a free and fair electoral process, or to impose emergency
 laws, under the phony pretext of a major Contra-initiated breakdown of
 the ceasefire;
 (6) strongly urges the extension of the period during which Nicaraguans
 are permitted to register to vote for at least sixty days;
 (7) reaffirms its intention to abide by the provisions of the Bipartisan
 Accord on Nicaragua and Public Law 101-14, to include continuing to provide
 humanitarian assistance to the Contras until February 28, 1990; and
 (8) reminds Ortega, the Sandinista regime, and the other leaders of the
 hemisphere that United States policy articulated in the Bipartisan Accord on
 Nicaragua and Public Law 101-14 is contingent on the Sandinistas fulfilling
 the commitments they have undertaken as part of the Central American peace
 process.
