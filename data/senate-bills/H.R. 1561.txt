         DIVISION A--CONSOLIDATION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENCIES

                      TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This division may be cited as the ``Foreign Affairs Agencies 
Consolidation Act of 1996''.

SEC. 102. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) With the end of the Cold War, the international challenges 
    facing the United States have changed, but the fundamental national 
    interests of the United States have not. The security, economic, 
    and humanitarian interests of the United States require continued 
    United States engagement in international affairs. The leading role 
    of the United States in world affairs will be as important in the 
    twenty-first century as it has been in the twentieth.
        (2) The United States budget deficit requires that the foreign 
    as well as the domestic programs and activities of the United 
    States be carefully reviewed for potential savings. Wherever 
    possible, foreign programs and activities must be streamlined, 
    managed more efficiently, and adapted to the requirements of the 
    post-Cold War era.
        (3) In order to downsize the foreign programs and activities of 
    the United States without jeopardizing United States interests, 
    strong and effective leadership will be required. As the official 
    principally responsible for the conduct of foreign policy, the 
    Secretary of State must have the authority to allocate efficiently 
    the resources within the international affairs budget. As a first 
    step in the downsizing process, the proliferation of foreign 
    affairs agencies that occurred during the Cold War must be 
    reversed, and the functions of these agencies must be restored to 
    the Secretary of State.
        (4) A streamlined and reorganized foreign affairs structure 
    under the strengthened leadership of the Secretary of State can 
    more effectively promote the international interests of the
    United States in the next century than the existing structure.

SEC. 103. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this division are--
        (1) to consolidate and reinvent the foreign affairs agencies of 
    the United States within the Department of State;
        (2) to assist congressional efforts to balance the Federal 
    budget and reduce the Federal debt;
        (3) to provide for the reorganization of the Department of 
    State to maximize the efficient use of resources, eliminate 
    redundancy in functions, effect budget savings, and improve the 
    management of the Department of State;
        (4) to ensure that the United States maintains adequate 
    representation abroad within budgetary restraints;
        (5) to ensure that programs critical to the promotion of United 
    States national interests be maintained;
        (6) to encourage United States foreign affairs agencies to 
    maintain a high percentage of the best qualified, most competent 
    United States citizens serving in the United States Government 
    while downsizing significantly the total number of people employed 
    by such agencies;
        (7) to strengthen--
            (A) the coordination of United States foreign policy; and
            (B) the leading role of the Secretary of State in the 
        formulation and articulation of United States foreign policy; 
        and
        (8) to abolish, not later than March 1, 1997, the United States 
    Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the United States Information 
    Agency, the United States International Development Cooperation 
    Agency, and the Agency for International Development.

    citizenship; or
        (2) for the promotion, direct or indirect, of the principle or 
    doctrine of one world government or one world citizenship.

SEC. 1504. INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On April 2, 1992, the Senate approved a resolution of 
    advice and consent to ratification of the International Covenant on 
    Civil and Political Rights, subject to reservations, 
    understandings, declarations, and a proviso intended, inter alia, 
    to protect the First Amendment rights of American citizens and 
    other United States constitutional rights and practices.
        (2) In accordance with the action of the Senate, the President 
    deposited the United States instrument of ratification of the 
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on June 8, 
    1992, and the Covenant entered into force for the United States on 
    September 8, 1992.
        (3) On November 2, 1994, the Human Rights Committee, 
    established under the Covenant to interpret the Covenant and to 
    receive complaints of noncompliance, adopted General Comment No. 24 
    regarding reservations to the Covenant.
        (4) In General Comment No. 24, the Human Rights Committee 
    claimed for itself the power to judge the validity under 
    international law of reservations to the Covenant, and in the 
    purported exercise of this power asserted that reservations of the 
    type included in the Senate resolution of ratification are invalid, 
    and further asserted that invalid reservations will be read out of 
    instruments of ratification, ``in the sense that the Covenant will 
    be operative for the reserving party without benefit of the 
    reservation''.
        (5) The purpose and effect of General Comment No. 24 is to seek 
    to nullify as a matter of international law the reservations, 
    understandings, declarations, and proviso contained in the Senate 
    resolution of ratification, thereby purporting to impose legal 
    obligations on the United States never accepted by the United 
    States.
        (6) General Comment No. 24 threatens not only the Supremacy 
    Clause of the United States Constitution and the constitutional 
    authority of the Senate with respect to the approval of treaties, 
    but also the First Amendment rights of American citizens and the 
    other United States constitutional rights and practices protected 
    by the reservations, understandings, declarations, and proviso 
    contained in the Senate resolution of ratification.
    (b) Restriction on Obligation or Expenditure of Funds.--
        (1) Restriction.--Effective two years after the date of 
    enactment of this Act, no funds authorized to be appropriated by 
    this Act or any other Act, or otherwise made available, may be 
    obligated or expended for the conduct of any activity which has the 
    purpose or effect of--
            (A) reporting to the Human Rights Committee in accordance 
        with Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
        Political Rights, or
            (B) responding to any effort by the Human Rights Committee 
        to use the procedures of Articles 41 and 42 of the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to resolve 
        claims by other parties to the Covenant that the United States 
        is not fulfilling its obligations under the Covenant,
    until the President has submitted to the Congress the certification 
    described in paragraph (2).
        (2) Certification.--The certification referred to in paragraph 
    (1) is a certification by the President to the Congress that the 
    Human Rights Committee established under the International Covenant 
    on Civil and Political Rights has--
            (A) revoked its General Comment No. 24 adopted on November 
        2, 1994; and
            (B) expressly recognized the validity as a matter of 
        international law of the reservations, understandings, and 
        declarations contained in the United States instrument of 
        ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and 
        Political Rights.

SEC. 1505. UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN SINGLE COMMODITY 
              INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report that--
        (1) identifies the national interests, if any, that are served 
    by continuing United States participation in single-commodity 
    international organizations;
        (2) assesses the current and projected costs of continuing 
    United States participation in such organizations in light of the 
    increasingly limited funds available to fund United States 
    participation in all international organizations;
        (3) assesses the feasibility and desirability of the 
    privatization of United States representation in such 
    organizations; and
        (4) sets forth options for achieving the privatization of the 
    organizations if the Secretary determines that the privatization is 
    feasible and desirable.

    freedom to conduct any and all inspections that it deems necessary

    controlled by the Nuclear Supplier Group Guidelines are delivered 
    for a light water reactor for North Korea.

    reactors and related facilities in North Korea, including

Interests With Respect to North Korea.--It is further the sense of the

        and components;
            (D) obtaining positive and productive cooperation from 
        North Korea on the recovery of remains of Americans missing in 
        action from the Korean War without consenting to exorbitant 
        demands by North Korea for financial compensation; and

        confirmation that North Korea has ended its participation in 
        and support of international terrorism.

              ASSISTANCE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The United States Federal budget deficit and spending 
    constraints require the maximum efficiency in the usage of United

    important component of United States foreign policy.

    prudence, the United States should seek to promote the delivery of 
    humanitarian assistance to people in need in a manner that is both 
    timely and cost effective.

any country under paragraph (1) shall cease to be effective when the

either directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United 
States humanitarian assistance.

                  TITLE XVII--CONGRESSIONAL STATEMENTS

SEC. 1701. THE LAOGAI SYSTEM OF POLITICAL PRISONS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the President should--
        (1) publicly condemn the continued existence of the Chinese 
    gulag, known as the Laogai, and call upon the Government of the 
    People's Republic of China to dismantle it and release all of its 
    political prisoners; and
        (2) instruct the appropriate diplomatic representatives of the 
    United States to cause a resolution condemning the Laogai to be put 
    before the United Nations Human Rights Commission and work for its 
    passage.

SEC. 1702. DECLARATION OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
              HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY TOWARD CHINA.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) According to the 1994 State Department Country Reports on 
    Human Rights Practices, there continue to be ``widespread and well-
    documented human rights abuses in China, in violation of 
    internationally accepted norms . . . (including) arbitrary and 
    lengthy incommunicado detention, torture, and mistreatment of 
    prisoners. The regime continued severe restrictions on freedoms of 
    speech, press assembly and association, and tightened controls on 
    the exercise of these rights during 1994. Serious human rights 
    abuses persisted in Tibet and other areas populated by ethnic 
    minorities''.
        (2) The President, in announcing his decision on Most Favored 
    Nation trading status for China in May 1994 stated that, ``China 
    continues to commit very serious human rights abuses. Even as we 
    engage the Chinese on military, political, and economic issues, we 
    intend to stay engaged with those in China who suffer from human 
    rights abuses. The United States must remain a champion of their 
    liberties''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
President should take the following actions:
        (1) Decline the invitation to visit China until and unless 
    there is dramatic overall progress on human rights in China and 
    Tibet and communicate to the Government of China that such a visit 
    cannot take place without such progress. Indications of overall 
    progress would include the release of hundreds of political, 
    religious, and labor activists; an agreement to allow unhindered 
    confidential access to prisoners by international humanitarian 
    agencies; enactment of major legal reforms such as an end to all 
    restrictions on the exercise of freedom of religion, revocation of 
    the 1993 state security law, and the abolition of all so-called 
    ``counter-revolutionary'' crimes; an end to forced abortion, forced 
    sterilization, and the provision by government facilities of human 
    fetal remains for consumption as food; and a decision to allow 
    unrestricted access to Tibet by foreign media and international 
    human rights monitors.
        (2) Seek to develop an agreement on a multilateral strategy to 
    promote human rights in China. Such an agreement should include 
    efforts to encourage greater cooperation by the Government of China 
    with the human rights rapporteurs and working groups of the United 
    Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as bilateral and 
    multilateral initiatives to secure the unconditional release of 
    imprisoned peaceful pro-democracy advocates such as Wei Jingsheng.
        (3) Extend an invitation to the Dalai Lama to visit Washington, 
    District of Columbia, in 1996.
    (c) United States Government Human Rights Policy Toward China.--It 
shall be the policy of the United States Government to continue to 
promote internationally recognized human rights and worker rights in 
China and Tibet. The President shall submit the following reports on 
the formulation and implementation of United States human rights policy 
toward China and the results of that policy to the appropriate 
congressional committees:
        (1) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
    Act, the President shall report on the status of the ``new United 
    States Human Rights Policy for China'' announced by the President 
    on May 26, 1994, including an assessment of the implementation and 
    effectiveness of the policy in bringing about human rights 
    improvements in China and Tibet, with reference to the following 
    specific initiatives announced on that date:
            (A) High-level dialogue on human rights.
            (B) Voluntary principles in the area of human rights for 
        United States businesses operating in China.
            (C) Increased contact with and support for groups and 
        individuals in China promoting law reform and human rights.
            (D) Increased exchanges to support human rights law reform 
        in China.
            (E) The practice of all United States officials who visit 
        China to meet with the broadest possible spectrum of Chinese 
        citizens.
            (F) Increased efforts to press United States views on human 
        rights in China at the United Nations, the United Nations Human 
        Rights Commission, and other international organizations.
            (G) A plan of international actions to address Tibet's 
        human rights problems and to promote substantive discussions 
        between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government.
            (H) An information strategy for promoting human rights by 
        expanding Chinese and Tibetan language broadcasts on the Voice 
        of America and establishing Radio Free Asia.
            (I) Encouraging the Chinese Government to permit 
        international human rights groups to operate in and visit 
        China.

    The report required by this paragraph shall also assess the 
    progress, if any, of the People's Republic of China toward ending 
    forced abortion, forced sterilization, and other coercive 
    population control practices.
        (2) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this 
    Act, the President shall report on the status of Chinese Government 
    compliance with United States laws prohibiting the importation into 
    the United States of forced labor products, including (but not 
    limited to) a complete assessment and report on the implementation 
    of the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the United States and 
    China in 1992. The report shall include (but not be limited to) the 
    following:
            (A) All efforts made by the United States Customs Service 
        from 1992 until the date of the report to investigate forced 
        labor exports and to conduct unannounced unrestricted 
        inspections of suspected forced labor sites in China, and the 
        extent to which Chinese authorities cooperated with such 
        investigations.
            (B) Recommendations of what further steps might be taken to 
        enhance United States effectiveness in prohibiting forced labor 
        exports to the United States from China.

              MACEDONIA (FYROM).

    It is the sense of the Congress that the Former Yugoslav Republic

assistance programs, including programs of the Export-Import Bank and 
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, if the government 
continues to respect the rights of all ethnic minorities.

Development Program-Administered Funds), at least $20,000,000 for

available for programs and services conducted in cooperation with the 
International Organization for Migration, the International Committee 
for the Red Cross, and nongovernmental organizations, for persons who 
are displaced within their countries of nationality.

SEC. 1705. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BORDER CROSSING FEES.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the United States Government 
should not impose or collect a border crossing fee along its borders 
with Canada and Mexico.

SEC. 1706. INTER-AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS.

    Taking into consideration the long-term commitment by the United 
States to the affairs of this Hemisphere and the need to build further 
upon the linkages between the United States and its neighbors, the 
Secretary of State, in allocating the level of resources for 
international organizations, should make every effort to pay the full 
United States assessed funding levels for the Organization of American 
States and the Pan American Health Organization so that these two 
entities, which are uniquely dependent on United States contributions, 
have adequate resources to contribute effectively to United States 
foreign policy initiatives.

SEC. 1707. ESCALATING COSTS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the executive branch should

peacekeeping operations in excess of funds specifically authorized and 
appropriated for this purpose.

SEC. 1708. VISIT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the President of the Republic 
of China on Taiwan should be admitted to the United States for a visit 
in 1996 with all appropriate courtesies.

    Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
    from the People's Republic of China's application for membership in 
    such organizations;
        (2) the United States should support the Republic of China on 
    Taiwan's earliest membership in the GATT and the WTO if it meets 
    full and legitimate membership criteria, including the elimination 
    of inappropriate tariff levels and nontariff barriers;
        (3) the United States should support the membership of the 
    People's Republic of China in the GATT and the WTO only if a sound 
    bilateral commercial agreement is reached between the United States 
    and the People's Republic of China, and that the People's Republic 
    of China makes significant progress in making its economic system 
    compatible with GATT and WTO principles; and
        (4) the People's Republic of China's application for membership 
    in the GATT and the WTO should be reviewed strictly in accordance 
    with the rules, guidelines, principles, precedents, and practices 
    of the GATT and the WTO.

    jobs to Palestinians;

    West Bank, closely coordinated with private sector investors, will

    and implementation of United States assistance plans to assist in 
    speeding the flow of goods and services between Israel and Gaza and
