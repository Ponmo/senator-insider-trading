  CHAPTER 1--BLOCK GRANTS FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES

SEC. 2101. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.
            (2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful 
        society which promotes the interests of children.
            (3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is 
        integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of 
        children.
            (4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families with 
        children had a child support order established and, of that 54 
        percent, only about one-half received the full amount due. Of 
        the cases enforced through the public child support enforcement 
        system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a collection.
            (5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families 
        with dependent children (in this section referred to as 
        ``AFDC'') has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-
        thirds of these recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent of 
        children receiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no 
        father is present.
                    (A)(i) The average monthly number of children 
                receiving AFDC benefits--
                            (I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;
                            (II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;
                            (III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and
                            (IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.
                    (ii) While the number of children receiving AFDC 
                benefits increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 
                1992, the total number of children in the United States 
                aged 0 to 18 has declined by 5.5 percent.
                    (B) The Department of Health and Human Services has 
                estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC 
                benefits within 10 years.
                    (C) The increase in the number of children 
                receiving public assistance is closely related to the 
                increase in births to unmarried women. Between 1970 and 
                1991, the percentage of live births to unmarried women 
                increased nearly threefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 
                percent.
            (6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births 
        is well documented as follows:
                    (A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital 
                teen pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 
                1,000 unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies 
                in 1991. The overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 
                14 percent from 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried 
                women in 1980 to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In 
                contrast, the overall pregnancy rate for married 
                couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980 and 1991, 
                from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 
                to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.
                    (B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 
                1970 and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 
                percent and if the current trend continues, 50 percent 
                of all births by the year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.
            (7) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on 
        the mother, the child, the family, and society are well 
        documented as follows:
                    (A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outside 
                of marriage are more likely to go on public assistance 
                and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These 
                combined effects of ``younger and longer'' increase 
                total AFDC costs per household by 25 percent to 30 
                percent for 17-year-olds.
                    (B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a 
                substantially higher risk of being born at a very low 
                or moderately low birth weight.
                    (C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to 
                experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as 
                more child abuse, and neglect.
                    (D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely 
                to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational 
                aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming 
                teenage parents themselves.
                    (E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces 
                the chances of the child growing up to have an intact 
                marriage.
                    (F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more 
                likely to be on welfare when they grow up.
            (8) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homes 
        were born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that of 
        children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced (37 
        percent). While many parents find themselves, through divorce 
        or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing the 
        difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, the 
        negative consequences of raising children in single-parent 
        homes are well documented as follows:
                    (A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with 
                children under 18 years of age have income below the 
                national poverty level. In contrast, 46 percent of 
                female-headed households with children under 18 years 
                of age are below the national poverty level.
                    (B) Among single-parent families, nearly \1/2\ of 
                the mothers who never married received AFDC while only 
                \1/5\ of divorced mothers received AFDC.
                    (C) Children born into families receiving welfare 
                assistance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare 
                when they reach adulthood than children not born into 
                families receiving welfare.
                    (D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the 
                greatest risk of bearing low-birth-weight babies.
                    (E) The younger the single parent mother, the less 
                likely she is to finish high school.
                    (F) Young women who have children before finishing 
                high school are more likely to receive welfare 
                assistance for a longer period of time.
                    (G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of 
                births to teenage mothers under the aid to families 
                with dependent children program, the food stamp 
                program, and the medicaid program has been estimated at 
                $120,000,000,000.
                    (H) The absence of a father in the life of a child 
                has a negative effect on school performance and peer 
                adjustment.
                    (I) Children of teenage single parents have lower 
                cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a 
                greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents 
                themselves.
                    (J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times 
                more likely to fail and repeat a year in grade school 
                than are children from intact 2-parent families.
                    (K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 
                times more likely to be expelled or suspended from 
                school.
                    (L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youth 
                aged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages of 
single-parent households have higher rates of violent crime.
                    (M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses 
                within the State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 
                percent lived primarily in a home with both parents. In 
                contrast to these incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of 
                the 62,800,000 children in the Nation's resident 
                population were living with both parents.
            (9) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisis 
        in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention 
        of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock 
        birth are very important Government interests and the policy 
        contained in part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (as 
        amended by section 2103(a) of this Act) is intended to address 
        the crisis.

SEC. 2102. REFERENCE TO SOCIAL SECURITY ACT.

    Except as otherwise specifically provided, wherever in this chapter 
an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to or repeal of a 
section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be 
made to that section or other provision of the Social Security Act.

SEC. 2103. BLOCK GRANTS TO STATES.

    (a) In General.--Part A of title IV (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking all that precedes section 418 (as added by 
        section 2803(b)(2) of this Act) and inserting the following:

        relatives;

        benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;
            ``(3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock 
        pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing 
        and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and
            ``(4) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent 
        families.

interpreted to entitle any individual or family to assistance under any 
State program funded under this part.

                        all political subdivisions in the State (not 
                        necessarily in a uniform manner), that provides 
                        assistance to needy families with (or 
                        expecting) children and provides parents with 
                        job preparation, work, and support services to 
                        enable them to leave the program and become 
                        self-sufficient.

                        the State determines the parent or caretaker is 
                        ready to engage in work, or once the parent or 
                        caretaker has received assistance under the 
                        program for 24 months (whether or not 
                        consecutive), whichever is earlier.

402(a)(28), as in effect and applied on the day before the date of the 
enactment of section 2302 of the Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Act of 1996. For purposes of subsection (d), the State

     CHAPTER 4--RESTRICTING WELFARE AND PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR ALIENS

SEC. 2400. STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL POLICY CONCERNING WELFARE AND 
              IMMIGRATION.

    The Congress makes the following statements concerning national 
policy with respect to welfare and immigration:
            (1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United 
        States immigration law since this country's earliest 
        immigration statutes.
            (2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United 
        States that--
                    (A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend 
                on public resources to meet their needs, but rather 
                rely on their own capabilities and the resources of 
                their families, their sponsors, and private 
                organizations, and
                    (B) the availability of public benefits not 
                constitute an incentive for immigration to the United 
                States.
            (3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have 
        been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, 
        State, and local governments at increasing rates.
            (4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and 
        unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly 
        incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the 
        public benefits system.
            (5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new 
        rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to 
        assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national 
        immigration policy.
            (6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the 
        incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability 
        of public benefits.
            (7) With respect to the State authority to make 
        determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens 
        for public benefits in this chapter, a State that chooses to 
        follow the Federal classification in determining the 
        eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be 
        considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available 
        for achieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring 
        that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national 
        immigration policy.

             Subchapter A--Eligibility for Federal Benefits

                carry out child care programs in accordance with this 
                subchapter, and that the lack of such facilities will 
                inhibit the operation of such programs in the future, 
                the Secretary may permit the tribe or organization to 
                use assistance provided under this subsection to make

organization as compared to the level of such services provided by the 
tribe or organization in the fiscal year preceding the year for which

SEC. 2905. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENTERPRISE ZONES.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:
            (1) Many of the Nation's urban centers are places with high 
        levels of poverty, high rates of welfare dependency, high crime 
        rates, poor schools, and joblessness;
            (2) Federal tax incentives and regulatory reforms can 
        encourage economic growth, job creation and small business 
        formation in many urban centers;
            (3) Encouraging private sector investment in America's 
        economically distressed urban and rural areas is essential to 
        breaking the cycle of poverty and the related ills of crime, 
        drug abuse, illiteracy, welfare dependency, and unemployment;
            (4) The empowerment zones enacted in 1993 should be 
        enhanced by providing incentives to increase entrepreneurial 
        growth, capital formation, job creation, educational 
        opportunities, and home ownership in the designated communities 
        and zones.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate 
that the Congress should adopt enterprise zone legislation in the One 
Hundred Fourth Congress, and that such enterprise zone legislation 
provide the following incentives and provisions:
            (1) Federal tax incentives that expand access to capital, 
        increase the formation and expansion of small businesses, and 
        promote commercial revitalization;
            (2) Regulatory reforms that allow localities to petition 
        Federal agencies, subject to the relevant agencies' approval, 
        for waivers or modifications of regulations to improve job 
        creation, small business formation and expansion, community 
        development, or economic revitalization objectives of the 
        enterprise zones;
            (3) Home ownership incentives and grants to encourage 
        resident management of public housing and home ownership of 
        public housing;
            (4) School reform pilot projects in certain designated 
        enterprise zones to provide low-income parents with new and 
        expanded educational options for their children's elementary 
        and secondary schooling.

SEC. 2906. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE INABILITY OF THE NON-
              CUSTODIAL PARENT TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (a) States should diligently continue their efforts to 
        enforce child support payments by the non-custodial parent to 
        the custodial parent, regardless of the employment status or 
        location of the non-custodial parent; and
            (b) States are encouraged to pursue pilot programs in which 
        the parents of a non-adult, non-custodial parent who refuses to 
        or is unable to pay child support must--
                    (1) pay or contribute to the child support owed by 
                the non-custodial parent; or
                    (2) otherwise fulfill all financial obligations and 
                meet all conditions imposed on the non-custodial 
                parent, such as participation in a work program or 
                other related activity.

                    ``(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous

                onsite surveys of a representative sample of nursing 
                facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date 
                of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, 
                in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the 
                adequacies of each State's surveys conducted under 
                paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the 
                Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the 
                State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the 
                State has determined that an individual nursing 
                facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), 
                (c), and (d), but the Secretary determines that the 
                facility does not meet such requirements, the 
                Secretary's determination as to the facility's 
                noncompliance with such requirements is binding and 
                supersedes that of the State survey.
                    ``(B) Scope.--With respect to each State, the 
                Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) 
                each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the 
                number of nursing facilities surveyed by the State in 
                the year, but in no case less than 5 nursing facilities 
                in the State.
                    ``(C) Reduction in administrative costs for 
                substandard performance.--If the Secretary finds, on 
                the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to 
                perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that 
                a State's survey and certification performance 
                otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary may provide 
                for the training of survey teams in the State and shall 
                provide for a reduction of the payment otherwise made 
                to the State under section 1512(a)(3)(C) with respect 
                to a quarter equal to 33 percent multiplied by a 
                fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the 
                total number of residents in nursing facilities 
                surveyed by the Secretary that quarter and the 
                numerator of which is equal to the total number of 
                residents in nursing facilities which were found 
                pursuant to such surveys to be not in compliance with 
                any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and 
                (d). A State that is dissatisfied with the Secretary's 
                findings under this subparagraph may obtain 
                reconsideration and review of the findings under 
                section 1116 in the same manner as a State may seek 
                reconsideration and review under that section of the 
                Secretary's determination under section 1116(a)(1).

                subsections (b), (c), and (d), the Secretary may 
                conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of 
                that survey, make independent and binding 
                determinations concerning the extent to which the

                identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving

        such date shall be brought or continued.

        under the program will not exceed the amount of the Federal 
        expenditures that would have been made if the project had not 
        been approved.
            (2) Use of savings.--The Secretary shall permit a State to 
        retain any savings achieved under a project and to use such 
        savings for--
                    (A) expanding eligibility for low income medicare 
                beneficiaries who are risk of institutionalization and 
                who, if institutionalized, are likely to qualify for 
                benefits under title XV of the Social Security Act, and
                    (B) providing a scope of services under the project

        a finding by the Secretary that the project has been 
        successful, shall be extended indefinitely.
            (2) Termination.--The Secretary may, with 90 days' notice, 
        terminate any demonstration project conducted under this

        the application approved by the Secretary under this section.
    (e) Applications.--Each State, or a coalition of States, desiring 
to conduct a demonstration project under this section shall prepare and 
submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, 
and containing such information as the Secretary may require, including 
an explanation of a plan for evaluating the project. The Secretary 
shall approve or deny an application not later than 90 days after the 
receipt of such application.
    (f) Payments.--For each calendar quarter occurring during a 
demonstration project conducted under this section, the Secretary shall 
provide for payments to the State in a manner consistent with 
subsection (b)(1).
    (g) Oversight.--The Secretary shall establish quality standards for 
evaluating and monitoring the demonstration projects conducted under 
this section. Such quality standards shall include reporting 
requirements which contain the following:
