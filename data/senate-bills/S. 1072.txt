                coordinate impaired driving cases into courts that 
                specialize in impaired driving cases, with the emphasis 
                on tracking and processing offenders of impaired 
                driving laws, (hereinafter referred to as DWI courts) 
                that meets the requirements of this paragraph.
                    ``(B) Characteristics.--A DWI Court is a distinct 
                function performed by a court system for the purpose of 
                changing the behavior of alcohol or drug dependent 
                offenders arrested for driving while impaired. A DWI 
                Court can be a dedicated court with dedicated 
                personnel, including judges, prosecutors and probation 
                officers. A DWI court may be an existing court system 
                that serves the following essential DWI Court 
                functions:
                            ``(i) A DWI Court performs an assessment of 
                        high-risk offenders utilizing a team headed by 
                        the judge and including all criminal justice 
                        stakeholders (prosecutors, defense attorneys, 
                        probations officers, law enforcement personnel 
                        and others) along with alcohol/drug treatment 
                        professionals.
                            ``(ii) The DWI Court team recommends a 
                        specific plea agreement or contract for each 
                        offender that can include incarceration, 
                        treatment, and close community supervision. The 
                        agreement maximizes the probability of 
                        rehabilitation and minimizes the likelihood of 
                        recidivism.
                            ``(iii) Compliance with the agreement is 
                        verified with thorough monitoring and frequent 
                        alcohol testing. Periodic status hearings 
                        assess offender progress and allow an 
                        opportunity for modifying the sentence if 
                        necessary.
                    ``(C) Assessment.--In the first year of operation, 
                the States shall assess the number of court systems in 
                its jurisdiction that are consistently performing the 
                DWI Court functions.
                    ``(D) Plan.--In the second year of operation, the 
                State shall develop a strategic plan for increasing the 
                number of courts performing the DWI function.
                    ``(E) Progress.--In subsequent years of operation, 
                the State shall demonstrate progress in increasing the 
                number of DWI Courts and in increasing the number of 
                high-risk offenders participating in and successfully 
                completing DWI Court agreements.
    ``(d) Uses of Grants.--Grants made under this section may be used 
for programs and activities described in subsection (c) and to defray 
the following costs:
            ``(1) Labor costs, management costs, and equipment 
        procurement costs for the high-visibility, Statewide law 
        enforcement campaigns under subsection (c)(1).
            ``(2) The costs of the training of law enforcement 
        personnel and the procurement of technology and equipment, such 
        as and including video equipment and passive alcohol sensors, 
        to counter directly impaired operation of motor vehicles.
            ``(3) The costs of public awareness, advertising, and 
        educational campaigns that publicize use of sobriety check 
        points or increased law enforcement efforts to counter impaired 
        operation of motor vehicles.
            ``(4) The costs of public awareness, advertising, and 
        educational campaigns that target impaired operation of motor 
        vehicles by persons under 34 years of age.
            ``(5) The costs of the development and implementation of a 
        State impaired operator information system described in 
        subsection (c)(3).
            ``(6) The costs of operating programs that impound the 
        vehicle of an individual arrested as an impaired operator of a 
        motor vehicle for not less than 12 hours after the operator is 
        arrested.

                   Subtitle C--Household Goods Movers

SEC. 4301. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF TITLE 49, UNITED STATES CODE.

    (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Household 
Goods Mover Oversight Enforcement and Reform Act of 2004''.
    (b) Amendment of Title 49, United States Code.--Except as otherwise 
specifically provided, whenever in this subtitle an amendment is 
expressed in terms of an amendment to a section or other provision of

provision of title 49, United States Code.

SEC. 4302. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) There are approximately 1,500,000 interstate household 
        moves every year. While the vast majority of these interstate 
        moves are completed successfully, consumer complaints have been 
        increasing since the Interstate Commerce Commission was 
        abolished in 1996 and oversight of the household goods industry 
        was transferred to the Department of Transportation.
            (2) While the overwhelming majority of household goods 
        carriers are honest and operate within the law, there appears 
        to be a growing criminal element that is exploiting a perceived 
        void in Federal and State enforcement efforts. The growing 
        criminal element tends to prey upon consumers.
            (3) The movement of an individual's household goods is 
        unique and differs from the movement of a commercial shipment. 
        A consumer may utilize a moving company once or twice in the 
        consumer's lifetime and entrust virtually all of the consumer's 
        worldly goods to a mover.
            (4) Federal resources are inadequate to properly police or 
        deter, on a nationwide basis, those movers who willfully 
        violate Federal regulations governing the household goods 
        industry and knowingly prey on consumers who are in a 
        vulnerable position. It is appropriate that a Federal-State 
        partnership be created to enhance enforcement against 
        fraudulent moving companies.

SEC. 4303. DEFINITIONS.

    In this title, the terms ``carrier'', ``household goods'', ``motor 
carrier'', ``Secretary'', and ``transportation'' have the meaning given 
such terms in section 13102 of title 49, United States Code.

SEC. 4304. PAYMENT OF RATES.

    Section 13707(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Shipments of household goods.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A carrier providing 
                transportation for a shipment of household goods shall 
                give up possession of the household goods transported

                            ``(i) 100 percent of the charges contained 
                        in a binding estimate provided by the carrier;

                        charges contained in a nonbinding estimate

                            ``(iii) in the case of a partial delivery 
                        of the shipment, the prorated percentage of the 
                        charges calculated in accordance with 
                        subparagraph (B).
                    ``(B) Calculation of prorated charges.--For

                the total charges due to the carrier as described in 
                clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) that is equal to 
                the percentage of the weight of that portion of the 
                shipment delivered to the total weight of the shipment.
                    ``(C) Post-contract services.--Subparagraph (A) 
                does not apply to additional services requested by a 
                shipper after the contract of service is executed that 
                were not included in the estimate.
                    ``(D) Impracticable operations.--Subparagraph (A) 
                does apply to impracticable operations, as defined by 
                the applicable carrier tariff, if the shipper agrees to 
                pay the charges for such operations within 30 days 
                after the goods are delivered.''.

SEC. 4305. HOUSEHOLD GOODS CARRIER OPERATIONS.

        paragraph (4); and
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (1), as amended by 
        paragraph (1), the following:
            ``(2) Other information.--At the time that a motor carrier 
        provides the written estimate required by paragraph (1), the 
        motor carrier shall provide the shipper a copy of the 
        Department of Transportation publication FMCSA-ESA-03-005 (or 
        its successor edition or publication) entitled `Ready to

                        transporting a particular type of load other 
                        than over the public highway and because of 
                        this special design such vehicle's capability 
                        to transport a load over the public highway is

    ``(e) Limitations on Built-In Losses.--
            ``(1) Limitation on importation of built-in losses.--
                    ``(A) In general.--If in any transaction described 
                in subsection (a) or (b) there would (but for this

                the basis of each property described in subparagraph 
                (B) which is acquired in such transaction shall 
                (notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b)) be its fair 
                market value immediately after such transaction.
                    ``(B) Property described.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), property is described in this

        such distributee shall be the same as it would be in the hands 
        of the transferor; except that the basis of such property in
