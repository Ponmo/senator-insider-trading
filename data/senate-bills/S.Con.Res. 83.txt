    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached staggering 
        proportions. Over 40,000,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS 
        worldwide, and 5,000,000 more people become infected each year. 
        HIV/AIDS is estimated to kill 3,000,000 men, women, and 
        children each year.
            (2) The United States was the first, and remains the 
        largest, contributor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
        Tuberculosis and Malaria (referred to in this section as the 
        ``Global Fund'').
            (3) The Presidential Administration of George W. Bush 
        (referred to in this section as the ``Administration'') has 
        supported legislative language that links United States 
        contributions to the Global Fund to the contributions of other 
        donors, permitting the United States to provide 33 percent of 
        all donations, which would match contributions on a 1-to-2 
        basis.
            (4) As of the date of the approval of this Resolution, 
        Congress has provided \1/3\ of all donations to the Global Fund 
        since its inception.
            (5) The Global Fund currently estimates that during fiscal 
        year 2007, it will renew $1,600,000,000 worth of effective 
        programs that are already operating on the ground, and the 
        Administration and Global Fund Board have said that renewals of 
        existing grants should receive priority funding.
            (6) The Global Fund estimates that during fiscal year 2007, 
        it could award $1,000,000,000 in funding to proposals submitted 
        for Round 6.
            (7) For fiscal year 2007, the President has requested 
        $300,000,000 for the United States contribution to the Global 
        Fund.
            (8) The Global Fund is an important component of the United 
        States efforts to combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and 
        supports approximately 350 projects in 130 countries.
            (9) Through a mid-year review process, Congress and the 
        Administration will assess contributions to date and 
        anticipated contributions to the Global Fund, and ensure that 
        United States contributions, at year end, are at the 
        appropriate 1-to-2 ratio.
            (10) Congress and the Administration will monitor 
        contributions to the Global Fund to ensure that United States 
        contributions do not exceed \1/3\ of the Global Fund's 
        revenues.
            (11) The United States will need to contribute $566,000,000 
        more than the President's fiscal year 2007 request for the 
        Global Fund to--
                    (A) fund \1/3\ of renewals during fiscal year 2007;

        provide an advance appropriation.
            (2) Advance appropriation.--An advance appropriation may be 
        provided for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 for programs, 
        projects, activities, or accounts identified in the joint

        appropriations'' in an aggregate amount not to exceed 
        $30,158,000,000 in new budget authority in each year.
            (3) Operation of point of order.--It shall be in order for 
        a Senator to raise a single point of order that several 
        provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or 
        conference report violate paragraph (1). The Presiding Officer 
        may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the 
        provisions against which the Senator raised the point of order. 
        If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of order as to 
        some of the provisions (including provisions of an amendment, 
        motion, or conference report), then only those provisions 
        (including provisions of an amendment, motion, or conference 
        report) shall be deemed stricken pursuant to this subsection.
            (4) Waiver and appeal.--Before the Presiding Officer rules 
        on a point of order under paragraph (1), any Senator may move 
        to waive such a point of order as it applies to some or all of 
        the provisions against which the point of order was raised. 
        Such a motion to waive is amendable in accordance with the 
        rules and precedents of the Senate. Paragraph (1) may be waived 
        or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of 
        three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. After the 
        Presiding Officer rules on a point of order under paragraph 
        (1), any Senator may appeal the ruling of the Presiding Officer 
        as it applies to some or all of the provisions. An affirmative 
        vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen 
        and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling 
        of the Chair on a point of order raised under paragraph (1).

        conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in 
        relation to, a bill or a joint resolution, upon--

                (a); and
                    (B) such a point of order being sustained,
        such material contained in such conference report or amendment 
        shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to 
        consider whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and 
        concur with a further amendment, or concur in the House 
        amendment with a further amendment, as the case may be, and the 
        matter stricken may not be offered as an amendment from the 
        floor.
            (6) Advance appropriation.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``advance appropriation'' means any new budget authority 
        provided in a bill or joint resolution making general 
        appropriations or continuing appropriations for fiscal year 
        2007 that first becomes available for any fiscal year after 
        2007 or any new budget authority provided in a bill or joint 
        resolution making general appropriations or continuing 
        appropriations for fiscal year 2008, that first becomes 
        available for any fiscal year after 2008.

        resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, if a point 
        of order is made by a Senator against an emergency designation 
        in that measure, that provision making such a designation shall 
        be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as an 
        amendment from the floor.
            (5) Exception for defense spending.--Paragraph (4) shall 
        not apply against an emergency designation for a provision

            (6) Operation of point of order.--It shall be in order for 
        a Senator to raise a single point of order against several

        designations shall be stricken from the measure and may not be 
        offered as amendments from the floor.

                recede from its amendment and concur with a further 
                amendment, or concur in the House amendment with a 
                further amendment, as the case may be, and the matter 
                stricken may not be offered as an amendment from the
