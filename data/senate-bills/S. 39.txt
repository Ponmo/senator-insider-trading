<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the 
``International Dolphin Conservation Program Act''.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) References to Marine Mammal Protection Act.--Except as 
otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or 
repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a 
section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be 
made to a section or other provision of the Marine Mammal Protection 
Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) to give effect to the Declaration of Panama, 
        signed October 4, 1995, by the Governments of Belize, Colombia, 
        Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, 
        the United States of America, Vanuatu, and Venezuela, including 
        the establishment of the International Dolphin Conservation 
        Program, relating to the protection of dolphins and other 
        species, and the conservation and management of tuna in the 
        eastern tropical Pacific Ocean;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) to recognize that nations fishing for tuna in 
        the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have achieved significant 
        reductions in dolphin mortality associated with that fishery; 
        and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) to eliminate the ban on imports of tuna from 
        those nations that are in compliance with the International 
        Dolphin Conservation Program.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) the nations that fish for tuna in the eastern 
        tropical Pacific Ocean have achieved significant reductions in 
        dolphin mortality associated with the purse seine fishery from 
        hundreds of thousands annually to fewer than 5,000 
        annually;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection 
        Act of 1972 that impose a ban on imports from nations that fish 
        for tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have served as 
        an incentive to reduce dolphin mortalities;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) tuna canners and processors of the United 
        States have led the canning and processing industry in 
        promoting a dolphin-safe tuna market; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) 12 signatory nations to the Declaration of 
        Panama, including the United States, agreed under that 
        Declaration to require that the total annual dolphin mortality 
        in the purse seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern 
        tropical Pacific Ocean not exceed 5,000 animals, with a 
        commitment and objective to progressively reduce dolphin 
        mortality to a level approaching zero through the setting of 
        annual limits with the goal of eliminating dolphin 
        mortality.</DELETED>

SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.

    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to give effect to the Declaration of Panama, signed 
        October 4, 1995, by the Governments of Belize, Colombia, Costa 
        Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, the 
        United States of America, Vanuatu, and Venezuela, including the 
        establishment of the International Dolphin Conservation 
        Program, relating to the protection of dolphins and other 
        species, and the conservation and management of tuna in the 
        eastern tropical Pacific Ocean;
            (2) to recognize that nations fishing for tuna in the 
        eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have achieved significant 
        reductions in dolphin mortality associated with that fishery; 
        and
            (3) to eliminate the ban on imports of tuna from those 
        nations that are in compliance with the International Dolphin 
        Conservation Program.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the nations that fish for tuna in the eastern tropical 
        Pacific Ocean have achieved significant reductions in dolphin 
        mortality associated with the purse seine fishery from hundreds 
        of thousands annually to fewer than 5,000 annually;
            (2) the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
        1972 that impose a ban on imports from nations that fish for 
        tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have served as an 
        incentive to reduce dolphin mortalities;
            (3) tuna canners and processors of the United States have 
        led the canning and processing industry in promoting a dolphin-
        safe tuna market; and
            (4) 12 signatory nations to the Declaration of Panama, 
        including the United States, agreed under that Declaration to 
        require that the total annual dolphin mortality in the purse 
        seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical 
        Pacific Ocean not exceed 5,000 animals, with a commitment and 
        objective to progressively reduce dolphin mortality to a level 
        approaching zero through the setting of annual limits with the 
        goal of eliminating dolphin mortality.
