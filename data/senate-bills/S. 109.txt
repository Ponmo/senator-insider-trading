“§ 304. Construction relating to separate coverage

“Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply to the treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been caused by or exacerbated by the performance of an abortion.

“§ 308. Treatment of abortions related to rape, incest, or preserving the life of the mother
“The limitations established in sections 301, 302, and 303 shall not apply to an abortion—
“(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or
“(2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.
