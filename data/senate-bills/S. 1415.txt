<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) General Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) The Food and Drug Administration and other 
        public health authorities view the use of tobacco products by 
        the nation's children as a ``pediatric disease'' of epic and 
        worsening proportions that results in new generations of 
        tobacco-dependent children and adults.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) There is a consensus within the scientific and 
        medical communities that tobacco products are inherently 
        dangerous and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious 
        adverse health effects.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) The Food and Drug Administration and other 
        health authorities have concluded that virtually all new users 
        of tobacco products are under the age of 18. Virtually all 
        Federal, State, and local officials and entities believe that 
        tobacco advertising and marketing contribute significantly to 
        the use of nicotine-containing tobacco products by adolescents 
        and as such, sweeping new restriction on the sale, promotion, 
        and distribution of such products are needed.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Federal, State, and local governments lack 
        many of the legal means and resources needed to address the 
        societal problems caused by the use of tobacco 
        products.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) Public health authorities believe that the 
        societal benefits of enacting tobacco settlement legislation in 
        human and economic terms would be vast. The Food and Drug 
        Administration found that reducing underage tobacco use 50 
        percent ``would prevent well over 60,000 early deaths''. The 
        Food and Drug Administration has estimated that the monetary 
        value of the regulations promulgated as a result of this Act 
        will be worth up to $43,000,000,000 per year in reduced medical 
        costs, improved productivity, and the benefit of avoiding the 
        premature death of loved ones.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) The unique position occupied by tobacco in the 
        history and economy of the United States, the magnitude of the 
        actual and potential tobacco-related litigation, the need to 
        avoid the cost, expense, uncertainty, and inconsistency 
        associated with such protracted litigation, the need to limit 
        the sale, distribution, marketing, and advertising of tobacco 
        products to persons of legal age, and the need to educate the 
        public (especially young people) of the health effects of using 
        tobacco products all dictate that it would be in the public 
        interest to enact legislation to facilitate a resolution of 
        such matters.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Findings Related to Interstate Commerce and the 
Judicial System.--Congress makes the following findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) The sale, distribution, marketing, 
        advertising, and use of tobacco products are activities 
        substantially affecting interstate commerce. Such products are 
        sold, marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate 
        commerce on a nationwide basis and have a substantial effect on 
        the economy of the United States.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) The sale, distribution, marketing, 
        advertising, and use of tobacco products are activities that 
        substantially affect interstate commerce by virtue of the 
        health care and other costs that Federal and State governmental 
        authorities have incurred because of the usage of tobacco 
        products.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Various civil actions brought by State 
        attorneys general, cities, counties, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
        Rico, third-party payors, and other private classes and 
        individuals to recover damages relating to tobacco-related 
        diseases, conditions and products are pending throughout the 
        United States, of these actions are slow-moving, expensive, and 
        burdensome not only for the litigants but also for Federal and 
        State judicial systems.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 3. PURPOSES.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    It is the purpose of this Act to--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) reiterate and enhance the authority of the 
        Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products and 
        provide for tobacco industry funding of the oversight 
        activities of the Administration;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) ban all outdoor tobacco advertising and ban 
        all cartoon characters and human figures used in connection 
        with tobacco advertising;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) provide for the funding by the tobacco 
        industry of an aggressive Federal enforcement program relating 
        to tobacco advertising and distribution, including a State-
        administered retail licensing system to prevent minors from 
        obtaining tobacco products;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) subject the tobacco industry to severe 
        financial penalties in the event that underage tobacco usage 
        does not decline radically over the next 10 years;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) provide for the establishment of national 
        standards to control the manufacturing of tobacco products and 
        the ingredients used in such products;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) provide certain regulatory powers to the Food 
        and Drug Administration to encourage the development and 
        marketing by the tobacco industry of ``less hazardous tobacco 
        products'', including the power to regulate the level of 
        nicotine in such products;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) require the manufacturers of tobacco products 
        to disclose all present and future non-public internal 
        laboratory research regarding tobacco products;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) establish a minimum Federal standard to limit 
        smoking in public places;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) provide for the establishment of a National 
        Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund to be funded by the tobacco 
        industry and used in accordance with this Act;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) provide for the establishment of a national 
        education-oriented counter advertising and tobacco control 
        campaign to be funded through the National Tobacco Settlement 
        Trust Fund;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) provide annual payments to States to fund 
        health benefits programs and to create a tobacco products 
        liability judgments and settlements fund to be funded through 
        the National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) provide for the establishment of a national 
        program of smoking cessation to be funded through the National 
        Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund.</DELETED>

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is 
        a pediatric disease of epic and worsening proportions that 
        results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and 
        adults.
            (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical 
        communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous and 
        cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse health 
        effects.
            (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.
            (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under 
        the minimum legal age to purchase such products.
            (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute 
        significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco 
        products by adolescents.
            (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and 
        marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb 
        tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the 
        sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.
            (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and 
        regulatory authority and resources they need to address 
        comprehensively the public health and societal problems caused 
        by the use of tobacco products.
            (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public 
        health community, and the public at large recognize that the 
        tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.
            (9) Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the 
        Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating 
        interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.
            (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and 
        use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially 
        affecting interstate commerce. Such products are sold, 
        marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce on 
        a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the 
        Nation's economy.
            (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and 
        use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce 
        through the health care and other costs attributable to the use 
        of tobacco products.
            (12) Civil actions against tobacco product manufacturers 
        and others are pending in Federal and State courts arising from 
        the use, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Among these 
        actions are cases brought by the attorneys general of more than 
        40 States, certain cities and counties, and the Commonwealth of 
        Puerto Rico, and other parties, including Indian tribes, and 
        class actions brought by private claimants (such as in the 
        Castano Civil Actions), seeking to recover monies expended to 
        treat tobacco-related diseases and for the protection of minors 
        and consumers, as well as penalties and other relief for 
        violations of antitrust, health, consumer protection, and other 
        laws.
            (13) Civil actions have been filed throughout the United 
        States against tobacco product manufacturers and their 
        distributors, trade associations, law firms, and consultants on 
        behalf of individuals or classes of individuals claiming to be 
        dependent upon and injured by tobacco products.
            (14) These civil actions are complex, time-consuming, 
        expensive, and burdensome for both the litigants and Federal 
        and State courts. To date, these civil actions have not 
        resulted in sufficient redress for smokers or non-governmental 
        third-party payers. To the extent that governmental entities 
        have been or may in the future be compensated for tobacco-
        related claims they have brought, it is not now possible to 
        identify what portions of such past or future recoveries can be 
        attributed to their various antitrust, health, consumer 
        protection, or other causes of action.
            (15) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt 
        comprehensive public health legislation because of tobacco's 
        unique position in the Nation's history and economy; the need 
        to prevent the sale, distribution, marketing and advertising of 
        tobacco products to persons under the minimum legal age to 
        purchase such products; and the need to educate the public, 
        especially young people, regarding the health effects of using 
        tobacco products.
            (16) The public interest requires a timely, fair, 
        equitable, and consistent result that will serve the public 
        interest by (A) providing that a portion of the costs of 
        treatment for diseases and adverse health effects associated 
        with the use of tobacco products is borne by the manufacturers 
        of these products, and (B) restricting throughout the Nation 
        the sale, distribution, marketing, and advertising of tobacco 
        products only to persons of legal age to purchase such 
        products.
            (17) Public health authorities estimate that the benefits 
        to the Nation of enacting Federal legislation to accomplish 
these goals would be significant in human and economic terms.
            (18) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent 
        would prevent well over 60,000 early deaths each year and save 
        up to $43 billion each year in reduced medical costs, improved 
        productivity, and the avoidance of premature deaths.
            (19) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco 
        products have been especially directed to attract young persons 
        to use tobacco products and these efforts have resulted in 
        increased use of such products by youth. Past efforts to 
        oversee these activities have not been successful in adequately 
        preventing such increased use.
            (20) In 1995, the tobacco industry spent close to 
        $4,900,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, 
        increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-term 
        attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.
            (21) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly 
        portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and 
        healthful to minors.
            (22) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by 
        persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 
        are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.
            (23) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of 
        sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with 
        sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports 
        and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting 
        activity.
            (24) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable 
        tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about 
        tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to 
        overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the 
        number of young people who begin to use tobacco.
            (25) Tobacco advertising increases the size of the tobacco 
        market by increasing consumption of tobacco products including 
        increasing tobacco use by young people.
            (26) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising 
        than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands, and 
        children as young as 3 to 6 years old can recognize a character 
        associated with smoking at the same rate as they recognize 
        cartoons and fast food characters.
            (27) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people 
        are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco 
        market.
            (28) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a 
        positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.
            (29) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent 
        unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation 
        prohibiting access to young people and providing for education 
        about tobacco use.
            (30) International experience shows that advertising 
        regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a greater 
        impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use than 
        weaker or less comprehensive ones. Text-only requirements, 
        while not as stringent as a ban, will help reduce underage use 
        of tobacco products while preserving the informational function 
        of advertising.
            (31) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt 
        legislation to address the public health crisis created by 
        actions of the tobacco industry.
            (32) If, as a direct or indirect result of this Act, the 
        consumption of tobacco products in the United States is reduced 
        significantly, then tobacco farmers, their families, and their 
        communities may suffer economic hardship and displacement, 
        notwithstanding their lack of involvement in the manufacturing 
        and marketing of tobacco products.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to confirm the authority of the Food and Drug 
        Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal 
        Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by 
        recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority with 
        respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of 
        tobacco products;
            (2) to require the tobacco industry to fund both Federal 
        and State oversight of the tobacco industry from on-going 
        payments by tobacco product manufacturers;
            (3) to require tobacco product manufacturers to provide 
        ongoing funding to be used for an aggressive Federal, State, 
        and local enforcement program and for a nationwide retail 
        licensing system to prevent minors from obtaining tobacco 
        products, while expressly permitting the States to adopt 
        additional measures that further restrict or eliminate the 
        products' use;
            (4) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration and the 
        States may continue to address issues of particular concern to 
        public health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young 
        people and dependence on tobacco;
            (5) to impose severe financial surcharges on tobacco 
        product manufacturers if they do not substantially reduce 
        tobacco use by young people during the next decade;
            (6) to authorize appropriate agencies of the Federal 
        government to set national standards controlling the 
        manufacture of tobacco products and the identity, public 
        disclosure, and amount of ingredients used in such products;
            (7) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to 
        ensure that the tobacco industry makes efforts to develop and 
        introduce less harmful tobacco products;
            (8) to confirm the Food and Drug Administration's authority 
        to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful 
        components of tobacco products;
            (9) in order to ensure that adults are better informed, to 
        require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose all research 
        which has not previously been made available, as well as 
        research generated in the future, relating to the health and 
        dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;
            (10) to impose on tobacco product manufacturers the 
        obligation to provide funding for a variety of public health 
        initiatives;
            (11) to establish a minimum Federal standard for stringent 
        restrictions on smoking in public places, with funding to 
        enforce such standard derived from payments made by tobacco 
        product manufacturers, while also to permit State, Tribal, and 
        local governments to enact additional and more stringent 
        standards or elect not to be covered by the Federal standard;
            (12) to authorize and fund from payments by tobacco product 
        manufacturers a continuing national counter-advertising and 
        tobacco control campaign which seeks to educate consumers and 
        discourage children and adolescents from beginning to use 
        tobacco products, and which encourages current users of tobacco 
        products to discontinue using such products;
            (13) to establish a mechanism to compensate the States in 
        settlement of their various claims against tobacco product 
        manufacturers;
            (14) to authorize and to fund from payments by tobacco 
        product manufacturers a nationwide program of smoking cessation 
        administered through State and Tribal governments and the 
        private sector;
            (15) to establish and fund from payments by tobacco product 
        manufacturers a National Tobacco Settlement Fund;
            (16) to affirm the rights of individuals to access to the 
        courts, to civil trial by jury, and to damages to compensate 
        them for harm caused by tobacco products;
            (17) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to 
        adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are not 
        sold or accessible to underage purchasers;
            (18) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the 
        tobacco industry; and
            (19) to protect tobacco farmers and their communities from 
        the economic impact of this Act by providing full funding for 
        and the continuation of the Federal tobacco program and by 
        providing funds for farmers and communities to develop new 
        opportunities in tobacco-dependent communities.

                     ``CHAPTER IX--TOBACCO PRODUCTS

``SEC. 901. FDA AUTHORITY OVER TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

     ``(a) In General.--Tobacco products shall be regulated by the 
Secretary under this chapter and shall not be subject to the provisions 
of chapter V, unless--
            ``(1) such products are intended for use in the diagnosis, 
        cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease (within 
        the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(B) or section 201(h)(2)); or
            ``(2) a health claim is made for such products under 
        section 201(g)(1)(C) or 201(h)(3).
    ``(b) Applicability.--This chapter shall apply to all tobacco 
products subject to the provisions of part 897 of title 21, Code of 
Federal Regulations, and to any other tobacco products that the 
Secretary by regulation deems to be subject to this chapter.
    ``(c) FDA Rule in Effect.--The provisions of part 897 of title 21, 
Code of Federal Regulations, shall be deemed to be lawful and to have 
been lawfully promulgated under the authority of this chapter. The 
provisions of such part that are not in effect on the date of enactment 
of this chapter shall take effect as in such part or upon such later 
date as determined by the Secretary by order.
    ``(d) Scope.--
            ``(1) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect 
        the regulation of drugs and devices under chapter V that are 
        not tobacco products by the Secretary under the Federal Food, 
        Drug and Cosmetic Act.
            ``(2) The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to 
        tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of the manufacturer, 
        or to the producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco growers, 
        tobacco warehouses, and tobacco grower cooperatives, nor shall 
        any employee of the Food and Drug Administration have any 
        authority whatsoever to enter onto a farm owned by a producer 
        of tobacco leaf without the written consent of such producer. 
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, if a 
        producer of tobacco leaf is also a tobacco product manufacturer 
        or controlled by a tobacco product manufacturer, the producer 
        shall be subject to this chapter in the producer's capacity as 
        a manufacturer. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to 
        grant the Secretary authority to promulgate regulations on any 
        matter that involves the production of tobacco leaf or a 
        producer thereof, other than activities by a manufacturer 
        affecting production. For purposes of the preceding sentence, 
        the term `controlled by' means a member of the same controlled 
        group of corporations as that term is used in section 52(a) of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or under common control 
        within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under section 
        52(b) of such Code.

``SEC. 902. ADULTERATED TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

    ``A tobacco product shall be deemed to be adulterated if--
            ``(1) it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, 
        putrid, or decomposed substance, or is otherwise contaminated 
        by any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render the 
        product injurious to health;
            ``(2) it has been prepared, packed, or held under 
        insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated 
        with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to 
        health;
            ``(3) its container is composed, in whole or in part, of 
        any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the 
        contents injurious to health;
            ``(4) it is, or purports to be or is represented as, a 
        tobacco product which is subject to a performance standard 
        established under section 907 unless such tobacco product is in 
        all respects in conformity with such standard;
            ``(5) it is required by section 910(a) to have premarket 
        approval, is not exempt under section 906(f), and does not have 
        an approved application in effect;
            ``(6) the methods used in, or the facilities or controls 
        used for, its manufacture, packing or storage are not in 
        conformity with applicable requirements under section 906(e)(1) 
        or an applicable condition prescribed by an order under section 
        906(e)(2); or
            ``(7) it is a tobacco product for which an exemption has 
        been granted under section 906(f) for investigational use and 
        the person who was granted such exemption or any investigator 
        who uses such tobacco product under such exemption fails to 
        comply with a requirement prescribed by or under such section.

``SEC. 903. MISBRANDED TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

    ``(a) In General.--A tobacco product shall be deemed to be 
misbranded--

        packages shall be established, by regulations prescribed by the 
        Secretary;

        by or under authority of this chapter to appear on the label or 
        labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such 
        conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements or 
        designs in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it 
        likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual 
        under customary conditions of purchase and use;
            ``(4) if it has an established name, unless its label 
        bears, to the exclusion of any other nonproprietary name, its

        that its labeling bear adequate directions for use, or adequate 
        warnings against use by children, that are necessary for the 
        protection of users unless its labeling conforms in all 
        respects to such regulations;

        compounded, or processed in any State in an establishment not

``SEC. 906. GENERAL PROVISIONS RESPECTING CONTROL OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

    ``(a) In General.--Any requirement established by or under section 
902, 903, 905, or 909 applicable to a tobacco product shall apply to 
such tobacco product until the applicability of the requirement to the 
tobacco product has been changed by action taken under section 907, 
section 910, or subsection (d) of this section, and any requirement 
established by or under section 902, 903, 905, or 909 which is 
inconsistent with a requirement imposed on such tobacco product under 
section 907, section 910, or subsection (d) of this section shall not 
apply to such tobacco product.
    ``(b) Information on Public Access and Comment.--Each notice of 
proposed rulemaking under section 907, 908, 909, or 910, or under this 
section, any other notice which is published in the Federal Register 
with respect to any other action taken under any such section and which 
states the reasons for such action, and each publication of findings 
required to be made in connection with rulemaking under any such 
section shall set forth--
            ``(1) the manner in which interested persons may examine 
        data and other information on which the notice or findings is 
        based; and
            ``(2) the period within which interested persons may 
        present their comments on the notice or findings (including the 
        need therefor) orally or in writing, which period shall be at 
        least 60 days but may not exceed 90 days unless the time is 
        extended by the Secretary by a notice published in the Federal 
        Register stating good cause therefor.
    ``(c) Limited Confidentiality of Information.--Any information 
reported to or otherwise obtained by the Secretary or the Secretary's 
representative under section 904, 907, 908, 909, or 910 or 704, or 
under subsection (e) or (f) of this section, which is exempt from 
disclosure under subsection (a) of section 552 of title 5, United 
States Code, by reason of subsection (b)(4) of that section shall be 
considered confidential and shall not be disclosed, except that the 
information may be disclosed to other officers or employees concerned 
with carrying out this chapter, or when relevant in any proceeding 
under this chapter.
    ``(d) Restrictions.--
            ``(1) The Secretary may by regulation require that a 
        tobacco product be restricted to sale, distribution, or use 
        upon such conditions, including restrictions on the access to, 
        and the advertising and promotion of, the tobacco product, as 
        the Secretary may prescribe in such regulation if, because of 
        its potentiality for harmful effect or the collateral measures 
        necessary to its use, the Secretary determines that such 
        regulation would be appropriate for the protection of the 
        public health. The finding as to whether such regulation would 
        be appropriate for the protection of the public health shall be 
        determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the 
        population as a whole, including users and non-users of the 
        tobacco product, and taking into account--
                    ``(A) the increased or decreased likelihood that 
                existing users of tobacco products will stop using such 
                products; and
                    ``(B) the increased or decreased likelihood that 
                those who do not use tobacco products will start using 
                such products.
        No such condition may require that the sale or distribution of 
        a tobacco product be limited to the written or oral 
        authorization of a practitioner licensed by law to prescribe 
        medical products.
            ``(2) The label of a tobacco product shall bear such 
        appropriate statements of the restrictions required by a 
        regulation under subsection (a) as the Secretary may in such 
        regulation prescribe.
            ``(3) Because of the importance of any decision by the 
        Secretary to restrict the sale of any class of tobacco products 
        on the market on the date of enactment of the National Tobacco 
        Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act to specified categories 
        of retail outlets, it is appropriate for the Congress to have 
        the opportunity to review such a decision. Therefore, any such 
        restriction may not take effect before the date that is 2 years 
        after the President notifies the Congress that a final 
        regulation imposing the restriction has been issued.
    ``(e) Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements.--
            ``(1) Methods, facilities, and controls to conform.--
                    ``(A) The Secretary may, in accordance with 
                subparagraph (B), prescribe regulations requiring that

                used for, the manufacture, pre-production design 
                validation (including a process to assess the 
                performance of a tobacco product), packing and storage 
                of a tobacco product, conform to current good 
                manufacturing practice, as prescribed in such 
                regulations, to assure that the public health is 
                protected and that the tobacco product is in compliance 
                with this chapter.

                        tobacco products have historically been 
                        produced, the financial resources of the

        eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more 
        practicable means is available under the provisions of this 
        chapter (other than this section) to eliminate such risk,
the Secretary may issue such order as may be necessary to assure that 
adequate notification is provided in an appropriate form, by the 
persons and means best suited under the circumstances involved, to all 
persons who should properly receive such notification in order to 
eliminate such risk. The Secretary may order notification by any 
appropriate means, including public service announcements. Before 
issuing an order under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult 
with the persons who are to give notice under the order.
    ``(b) No Exemption From Other Liability.--Compliance with an order 
issued under this section shall not relieve any person from liability 
under Federal or State law. In awarding damages for economic loss in an 
action brought for the enforcement of any such liability, the value to 
the plaintiff in such action of any remedy provided under such order 
shall be taken into account.
    ``(c) Recall Authority.--
            ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary finds that there is a 
        reasonable probability that a tobacco product contains a 
        manufacturing or other defect not ordinarily contained in 
        tobacco products on the market that would cause serious, 
        adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue 
        an order requiring the appropriate person (including the 
        manufacturers, importers, distributors, or retailers of the 
        tobacco product) to immediately cease distribution of such 
        tobacco product. The order shall provide the person subject to 
        the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be 
        held not later than 10 days after the date of the issuance of 
        the order, on the actions required by the order and on whether 
        the order should be amended to require a recall of such tobacco 
        product. If, after providing an opportunity for such a hearing, 
        the Secretary determines that inadequate grounds exist to

                provided in subparagraph (B), amend the order to 
                require a recall. The Secretary shall specify a 
                timetable in which the tobacco product recall will 
                occur and shall require periodic reports to the 
Secretary describing the progress of the recall.

        tobacco product, or to verify a record, report, or information 
        submitted under this chapter.
In prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall 
have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession 
and the interests of patients. The prohibitions of paragraph (6) of 
this subsection continue to apply to records, reports, and information 
concerning any individual who has been a patient, irrespective of 
whether or when he ceases to be a patient.

reasonable grounds for the petitioner's failure to adduce such data, 
views, or arguments in the proceedings before the Secretary, the court 
may order the Secretary to provide additional opportunity for the oral 
presentation of data, views, or arguments and for written submissions. 
The Secretary may modify the Secretary's findings, or make new findings

Secretary's recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting 
aside of the regulation or order being reviewed, with the return of 
such additional data, views, or arguments.

to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a 
whole.

    ``(a) Discretionary Surveillance.--The Secretary may require a 
tobacco product manufacturer to conduct postmarket surveillance for a 
tobacco product of the manufacturer if the Secretary determines that 
postmarket surveillance of the tobacco product is necessary to protect 
the public health or is necessary to provide information regarding the 
health risks and other safety issues involving the tobacco product.

required to conduct a surveillance of a tobacco product under 
subsection (a) of this section shall, within 30 days after receiving

surveillance. The Secretary, within 60 days of the receipt of such 
protocol, shall determine if the principal investigator proposed to be 
used in the surveillance has sufficient qualifications and experience 
to conduct such surveillance and if such protocol will result in 
collection of useful data or other information necessary to protect the

                reduce harm to individuals caused by a tobacco product 
                and is otherwise appropriate to protect public health,

                        inhalation of a substantially lower yield of

SEC. 202. LOOK-BACK ASSESSMENT.

    (a) Determination of Underage Use.--Upon the conclusion of the 
third calendar year after the date of enactment of this Act, and 
annually thereafter, the Secretary shall determine the percent 
incidence of underage use of cigarettes and of smokeless tobacco by 
calculating the average, weighted by relative population of such age 
groups in 1995 as determined by the Bureau of the Census, of the 
percentages of individuals in grade 12 (ages 16 and 17), in grade 10 
(ages 14 and 15), and in grade 8 (age 13) who used cigarettes or 
smokeless tobacco, as appropriate, on a daily basis during the 
preceding calendar year. The percentages used in this calculation are 
to be those measured by (1) the University of Michigan Survey, or (2) 
such comparable index using identical methodology as is chosen by the 
Secretary after notice and the opportunity for comment in accordance 
with section 553 of title 5, United States Code. If the methodology 
employed by the University of Michigan Survey is changed in a material 
manner from that employed from 1986 through 1996 (including changes in 
the States or regions on which the University of Michigan Survey is 
based), or is (in the opinion of the Secretary) no longer the best 
available data, the Secretary shall use the percentages measured by an 
index chosen by the Secretary, after notice and the opportunity for 
comment in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, 
that has a methodology identical to that employed by the University of 
Michigan Survey from 1986 through 1996. The Secretary shall make the 
data on which the results of the University of Michigan Survey or such 
other comparable index are based available to the public upon request.
    (b) Calculation of Non-Attainment Penalties.--
            (1) Secretary to determine non-attainment percentage.--The 
        Secretary shall determine the non-attainment percentage for

            (2) Non-attainment penalty for cigarettes.--For each 
        calendar year in which the percentage reduction in underage use 
        required by section 201(b) is not attained, the Secretary shall 
        assess a penalty on cigarette manufacturers as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 If the non-attainment percentage is:                             The penalty is:               
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    (A) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar 
                year after the date of enactment of this Act, each

                subparagraph (A), the inflation adjustment for any 
                calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which--
                            (i) the CPI for the preceding calendar 
                        year, exceeds

        appropriate, in the year for which the penalty is being 
        assessed, based on actual Federal excise tax payments.
            (2) Exemption.--In any year in which a penalty is being 
        assessed, the Secretary shall exempt from payment any tobacco 
        product manufacturer with less than 1 percent of the domestic

        product manufacturer shall be liable under this subsection to 
        one or more other manufacturers if the plaintiff tobacco 
        product manufacturer establishes by a preponderance of the 
        evidence that the defendant tobacco product manufacturer, 
        through its acts or omissions, was responsible for a 
        disproportionate share of the non-attainment penalty as 
        compared to the responsibility of the plaintiff manufacturer, 
        as contemplated in subsection (c)(3).
            (3) Responsibility for agents, etc.--In any action brought

SEC. 203. SUBSTANTIAL NON-ATTAINMENT OF REQUIRED REDUCTIONS.

    (a) Action by Secretary.--
            (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the non-
        attainment percentage for any year is greater than 20 
        percentage points for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco, then the 
        Secretary shall determine, on a brand-by-brand basis, using 
        data that reflects a 1999 baseline, which tobacco product 
        manufacturers are responsible within the 2 categories of 
        tobacco products for the excess. The Secretary may commence an 
        action under this section against the tobacco product 
        manufacturer or manufacturers of the brand or brands of 
        cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products for which the non-
        attainment percentage exceeded 20 percentage points.
            (2) Determination.--The Secretary shall use research 
        methodology that is similar to, or the same as, that used in 
        the University of Michigan Survey, except--
                    (A) the methodology shall be adapted to determining 
                underage usage by brand; and
                    (B) the base period shall be calendar year 1999.
    (b) Procedures.--Any action under this section shall be commenced 
by the Secretary in the United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia within 90 days after publication in the Federal Register of 
the determination that the non-attainment percentage for the tobacco 
product in question is greater than 20 percentage points. Any such 
action shall be heard and determined by a 3-judge court under section 
2284 of title 28, United States Code.
    (c) Determination by Court.--In any action under this section, the 
court shall determine whether the preponderance of the evidence shows 
that a tobacco product manufacturer--
            (1) has failed to comply substantially with the provisions 
        of this Act regarding underage tobacco use, of any rules or 
        regulations promulgated thereunder, or of any Federal or State 
        laws regarding underage tobacco use;
            (2) has taken any material action to undermine the 
        achievement of the required percentage reduction for the 
        tobacco product in question; or
            (3) has failed to comply with all recommendations of the 
        Tobacco Agreement Accountability Panel established under 
        section 801.
    (d) Removal of Annual Aggregate Payment Limitation.--Except as 
provided in subsections (e) and (g), if the court determines that the 
preponderance of the evidence shows that a tobacco product manufacturer 
engaged in conduct described in subsection (c) then section 706(c) of 
this Act does not apply to the enforcement against, or the payment by, 
such tobacco product manufacturer of any judgment or settlement that 
becomes final after that determination is made. The liability 
apportionment agreement described in section 706(e) of this Act shall 
not require that other tobacco product manufacturers pay an increased 
amount in any year over the amount they would have had to pay but for 
this section.
    (e) Defense.--An action under this section shall be dismissed, and 
subsection (d) shall not apply, if the court finds that the Secretary's 
determination under subsection (a) was unlawful under subparagraph (A), 
(B), (C), or (D) of section 706(2) of title 5, United States Code. Any 
judgments paid under section 706(c) of this Act and section (1)(d)(3) 
of the Protocol prior to a final judgment determining that the 
Secretary's determination was erroneous shall be fully credited, with 
interest, under section 707(e) of this Act and section (1)(d)(3) of the 
Protocol.
    (f) Review.--Decisions of the court under this section are 
reviewable only by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari granted upon 
the petition of any party. The applicability of subsection (d) shall be 
stayed during the pendency of any such petition or review.
    (g) Continuing Effect.--Subsection (d) shall cease to apply to a 
tobacco product manufacturer found to have engaged in conduct described 
in subsection (c) upon the later of--
            (1) a determination by the Secretary under section 201 
        after the commencement of action under subsection (a) that the 
        non-attainment percentage for the tobacco product in question 
        is 20 or fewer percentage points; or
            (2) a finding by the court in an action filed against the 
        Secretary by the manufacturer, not earlier than 2 years after 
        the determination described in subsection (c) becomes final, 
        that the preponderance of the evidence shows that, in the 
        period since that determination, the manufacturer--
                    (A) has complied with the provisions of this Act 
                regarding underage tobacco use, of any rules or 
                regulations promulgated thereunder, and of any other 
                applicable Federal, State, or local laws, rules, or 
                regulations;
                    (B) has not taken any action to undermine the 
                achievement of the required percentage reduction for 
                the tobacco product in question; and
                    (C) has pursued substantial additional measures 
                reasonably calculated to attain the required percentage 
                reduction for the tobacco product in question.
A judgment or settlement against the tobacco product manufacturer that 
becomes final after a determination or finding described in paragraph 
(1) or (2) of this subsection is not subject to subsection (d). An 
action under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be commenced in the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and shall be 
heard and determined by a 3-judge court under section 2284 of title 28, 
United States Code. A decision by the court under paragraph (2) of this 
subsection is reviewable only by the Supreme Court by writ of 
certiorari granted upon the petition of any party, and the decision 
shall be stayed during the pendency of the petition or review. A 
determination or finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this 
subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to bring a 
subsequent action under this section against any tobacco product 
manufacturer or the applicability of subsection (d) with respect to any 
such subsequent action.
    (h) Definitions.--The definitions set forth in section 701 of this 
Act apply to terms used in this section. A judgment or settlement 
becomes final within the meaning of this section when it would qualify 
as a final judgment or final settlement under section 701.

                with appropriate protection for the confidentiality of 
                information regarding the timing of inspections and 
                other investigative techniques whose effectiveness

                    (ii) the identity of the single State agency

        of outlets (not preselected on the basis of prior violations) 
        to measure overall levels of compliance as well as to identify 
        violations, and shall be conducted to provide a probability 
        sample of outlets. The sample must reflect the distribution of 
        the population under the age of 18 years throughout the State 
        and the distribution of the outlets throughout the State 
        accessible to youth. Indian tribes shall conduct such

        percent of the amount otherwise payable under this subtitle to 
        that State for the next fiscal year.
            (2) Compliance rate.--The Secretary shall withhold from any 
        State that fails to demonstrate a compliance rate of--
                    (A) at least 75 percent in the fifth and sixth 
                fiscal years after the date of enactment of the 
                National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Act;

                ninth fiscal years after such date; and
                    (C) at least 90 percent in every fiscal year 
                beginning with the tenth fiscal year after such date,
        an amount equal to one percentage point for each percentage 
        point by which the State failed to meet the percentage set 
        forth in this subsection for that year from the amount 
        otherwise payable under this subtitle for that fiscal year.
    (c) Definition.--For the purposes of this section, the term ``first

            (1) Upon notice from the Secretary that an amount payable 
        under section 202(e) has been ordered withheld under subsection 
        (b), a State may petition the Secretary for a release and 
        disbursement of up to 75 percent of the amount withheld, and 
        shall give timely written notice of such petition to the 
        attorney general of that State and to all tobacco product 
        manufacturers.
            (2) The agency shall conduct a hearing on such a petition, 
        in which the attorney general of the State and tobacco product 
        manufacturers may participate and be heard.
            (3) The burden shall be on the State to prove, by a 
        preponderance of the evidence, that the release and 
        disbursement should be made. The Secretary's decision on 
        whether to grant such a release, and the amount of any such 
        disbursement, shall be based on whether--
                    (A) the State has acted in good faith and in full 
                compliance with this Act, and any rules or regulations 
                promulgated under this Act;
                    (B) the State has pursued all reasonably available 
                measures to attain the compliance rates and required

                    (C) there is evidence of any direct or indirect 
                action by the State to undermine the achievement of the 
                compliance rates, the required percentage reductions, 
                or other terms and objectives of this Act or the 
                National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction 
                Act; and
                    (D) any other relevant evidence.
            (4) A State shall be entitled to interest on any withheld 
        amount released at the average United States 52-Week Treasury 
        Bill rate for the period between the withholding of the amount 
        and its release.
          (5) Any State attorney general or tobacco product 
        manufacturer aggrieved by a final decision on a petition filed 
        under this subsection may seek judicial review of such decision 
        within 30 days in the United States Court of Appeals for the 
        District of Columbia Circuit. Unless otherwise specified in 
        this Act, judicial review under this section shall be governed 
        by sections 701 through 706 of title 5, United States Code.
            (6) No stay or other injunctive relief enjoining a 
        reduction in a State's allotment pending appeal or otherwise 
        may be granted by the Secretary or any court.

                        and
                            (ii) provide the other States with annual 
                        payment terms that are equivalent to the most

                        settlement agreements with those 25 States.

SEC. 404. ADJUSTMENTS.

    The applicable base amount under section 403(b) for a given 
calendar year shall be adjusted as follows in determining the annual 
payment for that year:
            (1) Inflation adjustment.--
                    (A) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar 
                year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
                adjusted applicable base amount under section 403(b)(6) 
                is the amount of the annual payment made for the 
                preceding year increased by the greater of 3 percent or 
                the inflation adjustment, adjusted (for calendar year 
                2005 and later years) by the volume adjustment under 
                paragraph (2).
                    (B) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), the inflation adjustment for any 
                calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which--
                            (i) the CPI for the preceding calendar 
                        year, exceeds
                            (ii) the CPI for the second preceding 
                        calendar year.
                    (C) CPI.--For purposes of subparagraph (B), the CPI 
                for any calendar year is the average of the Consumer 
                Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the 
                Department of Labor.
                    (D) Rounding.--If any increase determined under 
                subparagraph (A) is not a multiple of $1,000, the 
                increase shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 
                $1,000.
            (2) Volume adjustment.--Beginning with calendar year 2005, 
        the applicable base amount (as adjusted for inflation under 
        paragraph (1)) shall be adjusted for changes in volume of 
        domestic sales by multiplying the applicable base amount by the 
        ratio of the actual volume for the preceding year to the base 
        volume. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base 
        volume'' means the number of units of tobacco products sold 
        domestically by the participating tobacco product manufacturers 
        in calendar year 1996, as reported by such manufacturers to the 
        Secretary of the Treasury.

SEC. 405. PAYMENTS TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO CONSUMERS.

    (a) Target Price.--Each participating tobacco product manufacturer 
shall use its best efforts to adjust the price at which it sells each 
unit of tobacco products in the domestic market or to an importer for 
resale in the domestic market by an amount sufficient to pass through 
to each purchaser on a per-unit basis an equal share of the annual 
payments to be made by such participating tobacco product manufacturer 
under this Act and the Master Settlement agreement for the year in 
which the sale occurs.
    (b) Collection of Deficiency.--
            (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that a 
        participating tobacco product manufacturer failed to comply 
        with subsection (a), the Secretary shall assess a penalty 
        against that manufacturer in an amount equal to--
                    (A) 110 percent of the shortfall amount; or
                    (B) if the failure to comply with subsection (a) 
                was intentional, up to 125 percent of the shortfall 
                amount.
            (2) Shortfall amount.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        term ``shortfall amount'' means--
                    (A) the number of units of tobacco products sold by 
                a tobacco product manufacturer during a calendar year, 
                multiplied by--
                    (B) the excess of--
                            (i) the average adjusted price for which 
                        each such unit would have been sold during that 
                        year if the tobacco product manufacturer had 
                        met the price contemplated by subsection (a); 
                        over
                            (ii) the average adjusted price for which 
                        each such unit was sold during that year.
            (3) Sole remedy for failure to pass payment through to 
        consumers.--This subsection is the sole remedy available to any 
        person, including any State, for the failure by a participating 
        tobacco product manufacturer to pass through the payments under 
        section 403 to consumers as required by subsection (a).

SEC. 406. TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS.

    All payments made under section 403 are ordinary and necessary 
business expenses for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, and no part thereof is either in settlement of an actual 
or potential liability for a fine or penalty (civil or criminal) or the 
cost of a tangible or intangible asset or other future benefit.

SEC. 407. ENFORCEMENT FOR NONPAYMENT.

    (a) Penalty.--Any participating tobacco product manufacturer that 
fails to make any payment required under section 403 or 405 within 60 
days after the date on which such fee is due is liable for a civil 
penalty of $100,000 for each day during the noncompliance period.
    (b) Noncompliance Period.--For purposes of this section, the term 
``noncompliance period'' means, with respect to any failure to make a 
payment required under section 403 or 405, the period--
            (1) beginning on the due date for such payment; and
            (2) ending on the date on which such payment is paid in 
        full.
    (c) Limitations.--
            (1) In general.--No penalty shall be imposed by subsection 
        (a) on any failure to make a payment under section 403 during 
        any period for which it is established to the satisfaction of 
        the Secretary of the Treasury that none of the persons 
        responsible for such failure knew or, exercising reasonable 
        diligence, should have known, that such failure existed.
            (2) Corrections.--No penalty shall be imposed under 
        subsection (a) on any failure to make a payment under section 
        403 if--
                    (A) such failure was due to reasonable cause and 
                not to willful neglect; and
                    (B) such failure is corrected during the 30-day 
                period beginning on the 1st date that any of the 
                persons responsible for such failure knew or, 
                exercising reasonable diligence, should have known, 
                that such failure existed.
            (3) Waiver.--In the case of any failure to make a payment 
        under section 403 that is due to reasonable cause and not to 
        willful neglect, the Secretary of the Treasury may waive all or 
        part of the penalty imposed under subsection (a) to the extent 
        that the Secretary determines that the payment of such penalty 
        would be excessive relative to the failure involved.
    (d) Status as Participating Tobacco Product Manufacturer.--If, at 
the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date on which a 
participating tobacco product manufacturer fails to make a timely 
payment as required under section 403, such manufacture has not fully 
paid the amount owed by such manufacturer under such section, such 
manufacturer shall be considered a nonparticipating tobacco product 
manufacturer and shall not be eligible for any protections or 
assistance provided for under this Act.

        determines that the Indian tribe is not willing or not 
        qualified to administer the requirements of the regulations 
        promulgated under this subsection, or the tribe is considered 
        to be a non-participating tobacco product manufacturer, the 
        Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, 
        shall implement and enforce such regulations on behalf of the 
        tribe.
            (6) Deficient applications; opportunity to cure.--If the

        within their service populations within the context of tribal 
        health programs if such programs meet the fundamental Federal 
        goals and purposes of Federal Indian health care law and

general makes such an election shall not be eligible to receive 
payments from the trust fund established by section 401. Procedures 
under this paragraph shall permit such a State to make such an election 
on a one-time basis.

SEC. 703. PREEMPTION AND RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAW.

    (a) Preemption.--No civil action involving a tobacco claim to which 
this title applies shall be maintained in any court except in 
accordance with this title.
    (b) Relationship to State Law.--This title supersedes State law 
only to the extent that State law is inconsistent with this title.
    (c) Criminal Liability.--Nothing in this title shall be construed 
to limit the criminal liability of tobacco product manufacturers, 
retailers, or distributors, or their officers, directors, employees, 
successors, or assigns.

SEC. 704. GOVERNMENTAL CLAIMS AND CASTANO CIVIL ACTIONS.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b) and in 
section 702(c), no State, political subdivision of a State, municipal 
corporation, governmental entity or corporation, Indian tribe, or 
agency or subdivision thereof, or other entity acting in parens 
patriae, may file or maintain any civil action involving a tobacco 
claim.
    (b) Effect of Settlement Agreement or Consent Decree.--Within 30 
days after the date of enactment of this Act, any State may request 
that tobacco product manufacturers enter into the Master Settlement 
Agreement or a consent decree. If a State makes such a request and 
enters into a consent decree, it may maintain a civil action involving 
a tobacco claim only to the extent necessary to permit continuing court 
jurisdiction over the consent decree. Nothing herein shall preclude any 
State from bringing suit or seeking a court order to enforce the terms 
of the Master Settlement Agreement or a consent decree.
    (c) Castano Civil Actions.--
            (1) The rights and benefits afforded in section 221 of this 
        Act, and the various research activities envisioned by this 
        Act, are provided in settlement of, and shall constitute the 
        exclusive remedy for the purpose of determining civil liability 
        as to those claims asserted in the Castano Civil Actions, and 
        all bases for any such claim under the laws of any State are 
        preempted (including State substantive, procedural, remedial, 
        and evidentiary provisions) and settled. The Castano Civil 
        Actions shall be dismissed with full reservation of the rights 
        of individual class members to pursue claims not based on 
        addiction or dependency in civil actions in accordance with 
        this Act. For purposes of determining application of statutes 
        of limitation or repose, individual actions filed within one 
        year after the effective date of this Act by those who were 
        included within a Castano Civil Action shall be considered to 
have been filed as of the date of the Castano Civil Action applicable 
to said individual.
            (2) For purposes of awarding attorneys fees and expenses 
        for those actions subject to this subsection, the matter at 
        issue shall be submitted to arbitration before one panel of 
        arbitrators. In any such arbitration, the arbitration panel 
        shall consist of 3 persons, one of whom shall be chosen by the 
        attorneys of the Castano Plaintiffs' Litigation Committee who 
        were signatories to the Memorandum of Understanding dated June 
        20, 1997, by and between tobacco product manufacturers, the 
        Attorneys General, and private attorneys, one of whom shall be 
        chosen by the participating tobacco product manufacturers, and 
        one of whom shall be chosen jointly by those 2 arbitrators.
            (3) The participating tobacco product manufacturers shall 
        pay the arbitration award.

SEC. 705. CONCURRENT JURISDICTION; FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION; ACTIONS; 
              DAMAGES; LIABILITY.

    (a) In General.--Any tobacco claim in any civil action to which 
this title applies shall be deemed to arise under this section and 
shall be governed by the provisions of this title, but the substantive 
rules of decision for such claim shall be derived from the law of the 
State or Tribe that would have been applicable but for the operation of 
this section, to the extent that such law is not inconsistent with the 
provisions of this title. This Federal cause of action shall be the 
exclusive means for the purpose of determining civil liability on any 
such tobacco claim in any civil action to which this title applies, and 
all other bases for tobacco claims under State, Tribal, and local law 
are hereby preempted. District courts of the United States and tribal 
courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of the States 
over any tobacco claim in any civil action under this section.
    (b) Permissible Defendants.--In any civil action to which this 
subtitle applies, tobacco claims may be filed or maintained only 
against--
            (1) a tobacco product manufacturer; or
            (2) a surviving entity established by a tobacco product 
        manufacturer.
    (c) Addiction and Dependence Claims Barred.--In any civil action to 
which this title applies, no addiction claim or dependence claim may be 
filed or maintained.
    (d) Requirements.--The following requirements apply to civil 
actions to which this title applies:
            (1) Future reduced-risk products.--In any civil action to 
        which this subtitle applies, no allegation or evidence relating 
        to reduced-risk tobacco products developed after the date of 
        enactment of this Act shall be admissible or discoverable in 
        any action on a tobacco claim arising out of, based on, or 
        related to any other tobacco product.
            (2) Production of documents.--All documents or other 
        records included in the document depository required to be 
        established and maintained under section 903 of this Act shall 
        be deemed produced in any civil action involving a tobacco 
        claim, and no court in such action shall require additional 
        production of any such document or record. Any such document 
        submitted to the court shall be considered authenticated with 
        the same legal status as the original.
    (e) Liability.--The following provisions regarding liability shall 
apply in civil actions to which this title applies:
            (1) A tobacco product manufacturer shall be liable for any 
        act or omission of its attorneys, advertising agencies, and 
        agents undertaken in the representation of such tobacco product 
        manufacturer.
            (2) A tobacco product manufacturer shall be liable in 
        connection with any tobacco claim for the liability, if any, of 
        any of its affiliates arising from tobacco products sold 
        directly by such affiliate in the United States or to an 
        importer for resale in the United States, unless such affiliate 
        is a participating tobacco product manufacturer or a non-
        participating tobacco product manufacturer.
            (3) Participating tobacco product manufacturers shall not 
        be jointly and severally liable on a tobacco claim with non-
        participating tobacco product manufacturers. Nothing in this 
        title prevents a participating tobacco product manufacturer 
        from being held jointly and severally liable with any other 
        person other than a non-participating tobacco product 
        manufacturer if such liability exists under the applicable 
        substantive rules of decision as determined under subsection 
        (a), except that any such imposition of joint and several 
        liability against a participating tobacco product manufacturer 
        shall be subject to the provisions of section 706.
            (4) In any civil action involving both a tobacco claim 
        against a participating tobacco product manufacturer based in 
        whole or in part upon conduct occurring prior to the date of 
        enactment of this Act and a claim against 1 or more non-
        participating tobacco product manufacturers, the court, upon 
        application of a participating tobacco product manufacturer 
        shall sever a trial so that all claims against participating 
        tobacco product manufacturers shall be tried separately from 
        any claim involving non-participating tobacco product 
        manufacturers. If such severance results in a tobacco claim 
        being submitted to more than 1 jury or to the same jury for 
        separate deliberation the participating tobacco product 
        manufacturer may not assert any claim that would prejudice the 
        dollar amount to be recovered by the holder of the tobacco 
        claim from the participating tobacco product manufacturer due 
        to the severance of the action including satisfaction by way of 
        jury verdict against the non-participating tobacco product 
        manufacturer. In any action brought against a participating 
        tobacco manufacturer and a person that is not a tobacco product 
        manufacturer, the court may sever the trial so that all claims 
        against such person may be tried separately.
            (5) In any civil action brought involving a tobacco claim, 
        there shall be a presumption that nicotine is addictive and 
        that the diseases identified as being caused by use of tobacco 
        products in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
        Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of 
        Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General (United States Public 
        Health Service 1989), The Health Consequences of Smoking: 
        Involuntary Smoking, (USPHS 1986); and The Health Consequences 
        of Using Smokeless Tobacco, (USPHS 1986), are caused in whole 
or in part by the use of tobacco products, (referred to elsewhere in 
this paragraph as the ``general causation presumption''), and a jury 
empaneled to hear a tobacco claim shall be so instructed. In all other 
respects, the burden of proof as to the issue of whether a plaintiff's 
specific disease or injury was caused by smoking shall be governed by 
the law of the State or Tribe in which the tobacco claim was brought. 
The general causation presumption shall in no way affect the ability of 
the defendant to introduce evidence or argument which the defendant 
would otherwise be entitled to present under the law of the State or 
Tribe in which the tobacco claim was brought to rebut the general 
causation presumption, or with respect to general causation, specific 
causation, or alternative causation, or to introduce any other evidence 
or argument which the defendant would otherwise be entitled to make.
    (f) Preservation of Insurance Claims.--
            (1) In general.--If all participating tobacco product 
        manufacturers fail to make the payments required by this Act 
        for any calendar year, then--
                    (A) beginning on the first day of the next calendar 
                year, subsection (a) does not apply to any insurance 
                claim (including a direct action claim) that is a 
                tobacco claim, regardless of when that claim arose;
                    (B) any statute of limitations or doctrine of 
                laches under applicable law shall be tolled for the 
                period--
                            (i) beginning on the date of enactment of 
                        this Act; and
                            (ii) ending on the last day of that 
                        calendar year; and
                    (C) an insurance claim (including a direct action 
                claim) that is a tobacco claim and that is pending on 
                the date of enactment of this Act shall be preserved.
            (2) Application of title 11, united states code.--For 
        purposes of this subsection, nothing in this Act shall be 
        construed to modify, suspend, or otherwise affect the 
        application of title 11, United States Code, to participating 
        tobacco manufacturers that fail to make such payments.
            (3) State law not affected.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed to expand or abridge State law.

SEC. 706. PAYMENT OF TOBACCO CLAIM SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided below, any judgment or 
settlement in any civil action to which this subtitle applies shall be 
subject to the process for payment of judgments and settlements set 
forth in this section. No participating tobacco product manufacturer 
shall be obligated to pay a judgment or settlement on a tobacco claim 
in any civil action to which this title applies except in accordance 
with this section. This section shall not apply to the portion, if any, 
of a judgment that imposes punitive damages based on any conduct that--
            (1) occurs after the date of enactment of this Act; and
            (2) is other than the manufacture, development, 
        advertising, marketing, or sale of tobacco products in 
        compliance with this Act and the Master Settlement Agreement.
    (b) Registration With the Secretary of the Treasury.--
            (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of settlements, 
        judgments, and payments in civil actions to which this title 
        applies.
            (2) Any party claiming entitlement to a monetary payment 
        under a final judgment or final settlement on a tobacco claim 
        shall register such claim with the Secretary by filing a true 
        and correct copy of the final judgment or final settlement 
        agreement with the Secretary and providing a copy of such 
        filing to all other parties to the judgment or settlement.
            (3) The Secretary shall assign a priority for payment based 
        upon the date on which a proper registration of a final 
        judgment or final settlement occurs.
            (4) Any participating tobacco product manufacturer making a 
        payment on any final judgment or final settlement to which this 
        section applies shall certify such payment to the Secretary by 
        filing a true and correct copy of the proof of payment and a 
        statement of the remaining unpaid portion, if any, of such 
        final judgment or final settlement with the Secretary and shall 
        provide a copy of such filing to all other parties to the 
        judgment or settlement.
    (c) Liability Cap.--The aggregate payments made by all 
participating tobacco product manufacturers in any calendar year may 
not exceed $6,500,000,000. The Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking 
within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act to establish a 
mechanism for implementing this subsection in such a way that payments 
may be made from all awards payable in that year. Amounts not payable 
because of the application of this subsection, shall be carried forward 
and paid in the next year, subject to the provisions of this 
subsection.
    (d) Injunctive Relief.--A participating tobacco product 
manufacturer may commence an action to enjoin any State court 
proceeding to enforce or execute any judgment or settlement where 
payment has not been authorized under this section. Such an action 
shall arise under the laws of the United States and may be commenced in 
the district court of the United States for the district in which the 
State court proceeding is pending.
    (e) Joint and Several Liability.--All participating tobacco product 
manufacturers shall be jointly and severally liable for, and shall 
enter into an agreement to apportion among them, any amounts payable 
under judgments and settlements governed by this section arising in 
whole or in part from conduct occurring prior to the date of enactment 
of this Act. No participating tobacco product manufacturer shall cease 
operations without establishing a surviving entity against which a 
tobacco claim may be brought. Any obligation or interest of a 
participating, tobacco product manufacturer arising under such 
liability apportionment agreement shall be given priority and shall not 
be rejected, avoided, or discharged in a proceeding, under title 11, 
United States Code, or in any liquidation, reorganization, 
receivership, or other insolvency proceeding under State law.

SEC. 707. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND EXPENSES.

        which litigation or services the attorney involved is unable to

                written reasons;
                    (B) procedures for the exchanging of exhibits and

        arbitration panel shall consider the following criteria:
                    (A) The time and labor required by the claimant.
                    (B) The novelty and difficulty of the questions 
                involved in the action for which the claimant is making 
                a claim.
                    (C) The skill requisite to perform the legal

SEC. 708. NON-PARTICIPATING TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS.

 TITLE VIII--TOBACCO INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE AND EMPLOYEE PROTECTION FROM 
                               REPRISALS

SEC. 801. TOBACCO INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Establishment of Accountability Panel.--The Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish an 
advisory panel, to be known as the ``Tobacco Agreement Accountability 
Panel''. The panel shall consist of the Surgeon General, the Director 
of the Center for Disease Control or the Director's delegate, and the 
Director of the Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health.
    (b) Tobacco Company Plan.--Within a year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, each participating tobacco product manufacturer 
shall adopt and submit to the Commissioner a plan to achieve the 
required percentage reductions in underage use of tobacco products set 
forth in section 201, and thereafter shall update its plan no less 
frequently than annually. The Commissioner shall provide a copy of each 
such plan to the panel, which shall review the plan and submit its 
views on the plan to the Commissioner. The panel may recommend 
amendment of any plan to incorporate additional measures to reduce 
underage tobacco use that are consistent with the provisions of this 
Act.
    (c) Annual Report.--The panel shall submit a report to the 
Commissioner and to the Congress by January 31 of each year, which 
shall be published in the Federal Register. In its report, the panel 
shall--
            (1) describe in detail each tobacco product manufacturer's 
        compliance with the provisions of this Act and its plan 
        submitted under subsection (b);
            (2) report on whether each tobacco product manufacturer's 
        efforts to reduce underage smoking are likely to result in 
        attainment of smoking reduction targets under section 201;
            (3) recommend, where necessary, additional measures 
        individual tobacco companies should undertake to meet those 
        targets; and
            (4) include, where applicable, the extent to which prior 
        panel recommendations have been adopted by each tobacco product 
        manufacturer.
    (d) Public Health Emergency.--If the panel determines unanimously 
at any time that a tobacco product manufacturer's actions or inactions 
with respect to its compliance with the Act are of such a nature as to 
create a clear and present danger to the attainment of the targets for 
underage smoking reduction, it shall immediately report such acts or 
omissions to the Commissioner. If the Commissioner determines that such 
report is supported by clear and convincing evidence, the Commissioner 
may bring an action under section 203 seeking the immediate suspension 
of the tobacco product manufacturer's annual limitation cap on civil 
judgments. If the court determines that the Commissioner has proved by 
clear and convincing evidence that the subject manufacturer's actions 
or inactions are of such a nature that they present a clear and present 
danger to the attainment of the targets for underage smoking reduction, 
the court may suspend the subject manufacturer's annual limitation cap 
on civil judgments.

SEC. 802. TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER EMPLOYEE PROTECTION.

    (a) Prohibited Acts.--No tobacco product manufacturer may 
discharge, demote, or otherwise discriminate against any employee with 
respect to compensation, terms, conditions, benefits, or privileges of 
employment because the employee (or any person acting under a request 
of the employee)--
            (1) notified the manufacturer, the Commissioner of Food and 
        Drugs, the Attorney General, or any Federal, State, or local 
        public health or law enforcement authority of an alleged 
        violation of this or any other Act;
            (2) refused to engage in any practice made unlawful by such 
        Acts, if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to 
        the manufacturer;
            (3) testified before Congress or at any Federal or State 
        proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of 
        such Acts;
            (4) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to 
        commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under such Acts, 
        or a proceeding for the administration or enforcement of any 
        requirement imposed under such Acts;
            (5) testified or is about to testify in any such 
        proceeding; or
            (6) assisted or participated, or is about to assist or 
        participate, in any manner in such a proceeding or in any other 
        manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to carry out 
        the purposes of such Acts.
    (b) Employee Complaint.--
            (1) Any employee of a tobacco product manufacturer who 
        believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted, or 
        otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of 
        subsection (a) of this section may, within 180 days after such 
        violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or her 
        behalf) a complaint with the Secretary alleging such discharge, 
        demotion, or discrimination. Upon receipt of such a complaint, 
        the Secretary shall notify the person named in the complaint of 
        its filing.
            (2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint under paragraph (1) of 
        this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation 
        of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days after 
        the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall complete 
        such investigation and shall notify in writing the complainant 
        (and any such person acting in his or her behalf) and the 
        person alleged to have committed such violation of the results 
        of the investigation conducted under this paragraph. Within 90 
        days after the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall 
        (unless the proceeding on the complaint is terminated by the 
        Secretary on the basis of a settlement entered into by the 
        Secretary and the person alleged to have committed such 
        violation) issue an order either providing the relief 
        prescribed in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or denying the 
        complaint. An order of the Secretary shall be made on the 
        record after notice and the opportunity for a hearing in 
        accordance with sections 554 and 556 of title 5, United States 
        Code. Upon the conclusion of such a hearing and the issuance of 
        a recommended decision that the complaint has merit, the 
        Secretary shall issue a preliminary order providing the relief 
        prescribed in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, but may not 
        order compensatory damages pending a final order. The Secretary 
        may not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a 
        complaint without the participation and consent of the 
        complainant.
            (B) If, in response to a complaint under paragraph (1) of 
        this subsection, the Secretary determines that a violation of 
        this paragraph has occurred, the Secretary shall order the 
        person who committed such violation to (i) take affirmative 
        action to abate the violation, and (ii) reinstate the 
        complainant to his or her former position together with 
        compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and 
        privileges of his or her employment. The Secretary may order 
        such person to provide compensatory damages to the complainant. 
        If an order is issued under this subparagraph, the Secretary, 
        at the request of the complainant, shall assess the person 
        against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate 
        amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' and 
        expert witness fees) reasonably incurred (as determined by the 
        Secretary), by the complainant for, or in connection with, the 
        bringing of the complaint upon which the order is issued.
            (3)(A) The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under 
        paragraph (1) of this subsection, and shall not conduct the 
        investigation required under paragraph (2) of this subsection, 
        unless the complainant has made a prima facie showing that any 
        behavior described in subsection (a) of this section was a 
        contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged 
        in the complaint.
            (B) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the 
        complainant has made the showing required by subparagraph (A) 
        of this paragraph, no investigation required under paragraph 
        (2) of this subsection shall be conducted if the manufacturer 
        demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would 
        have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence 
        of such behavior. Relief may not be ordered under paragraph (1) 
        of this subsection if the manufacturer demonstrates by clear 
        and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same 
        unfavorable personnel action in the absence of such behavior.
            (C) The Secretary may determine that a violation of 
        subsection (a) of this section has occurred only if the 
        complainant has demonstrated that any behavior described in 
        subsection (a) of this section was a contributing factor in 
        unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.
    (c) Judicial Review.--
            (1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order 
        issued under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review 
        of the order in the United States court of appeals for the 
        circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the order 
        was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review must be 
        filed within 60 days after the issuance of the Secretary's 
        order. Judicial review shall be available as provided in 
        chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The commencement of 
        proceedings under this subsection shall not, unless ordered by 
        the court, operate as a stay of the Secretary's order.
            (2) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review 
        could have been obtained under paragraph (1) of this subsection 
        shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or 
        civil proceeding.
    (d) Noncompliance.--Whenever a person has failed to comply with an 
order issued under subsection (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary may 
file a civil action in the United States district court for the 
district in which the violation occurred to enforce such order. In 
actions brought under this subsection, the district courts shall have 
jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive 
relief and compensatory and exemplary damages.
    (e) Action to Ensure Compliance.--
            (1) Any person on whose behalf an order was issued under 
        subsection (b)(2) of this section may commence a civil action 
        to require compliance with such order against the person to 
        whom such order was issued. The appropriate United States 
        district court shall have jurisdiction to enforce such order, 
        without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship 
        of the parties.
            (2) The court, in issuing any final order under this 
        subsection, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable 
        attorneys' and expert witness fees) to any party whenever the 
        court determines such award is appropriate.
    (f) Enforcement.--Any non-discretionary duty imposed by this 
section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding brought under 
section 1361 of title 28, United States Code.
    (g) Applicability to Certain Employees.--Subsection (a) of this 
section shall not apply with respect to any employee who, acting 
without direction from the manufacturer (or the agent of the 
manufacturer) deliberately causes a violation of any requirement of 
this Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et 
seq.), or any other law or regulation relating to tobacco products.
    (h) Effect on Other Laws.--This section shall not be construed to 
expand, diminish, or otherwise affect any right otherwise available to 
an employee under Federal or State law to redress the employee's 
discharge or other discriminatory action taken by a tobacco product 
manufacturer against the employee.
    (i) Posting.--The provisions of this section shall be prominently 
posted in any place of employment to which this section applies.

        TITLE IX--PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS

SEC. 901. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the American tobacco industry has made claims of

        privilege were not made in good faith; and
            (3) a prompt and full exposition of tobacco documents 
        will--
                    (A) promote understanding by the public of the

SEC. 904. PRIVILEGE AND TRADE SECRET CLAIMS.

    (a) Separate Submission of Documents.--Any document that is subject 
to a claim by a participating tobacco product manufacturer of attorney-
client privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret protection 
shall be so marked and shall be submitted separately to the Depository. 
Compliance with this subsection shall not be deemed to be a waiver of

of title 5 of the United States Code or the provisions of any State 
law, documents, and information provided to the United States

Protocol shall be kept confidential by and among the United States 
Department of Justice and such authorities and shall be used only for 
the governmental purposes of enforcing this Act, the Protocol, and the 
consent decrees. The inspection and discovery rights provided to the 
States under the Protocol and this section shall be exercised by each 
State but coordinated through a multi-state States' Attorneys General 
oversight committee.
    (c) Privilege and Trade Secret Logs.--
            (1) In general.--Within 15 days after submitting documents 
        to the Depository under subsection (a), each participating 
        tobacco product manufacturer shall submit to the Depository a 
        comprehensive log which identifies on a document-by-document 
        basis all documents produced to the Depository for which the 
        manufacturer asserts attorney-client privilege, attorney work-
        product, or trade secrecy. With respect to documents for which 
        the manufacturer previously has asserted one or more of the 
        aforementioned privileges or trade secret protection, the 
        manufacturer shall conduct a good faith de novo review of such 
        documents to determine whether such privilege or trade secret 
        protection is appropriate.
            (2) Organization of log.--The log shall be organized in 
        numerical order based upon the document identifier assigned to 
        each document. For each document, the log shall contain--
                    (A) a description of the document, including type 
                of document, title of document, name and position or 
                title of each author, addressee, and other recipient 
                who was intended to receive a copy, document date, 
                document purpose, and general subject matter;
                    (B) an explanation why the document or a portion of 
                the document is privileged or subject to trade secret 
                protection; and
                    (C) a statement whether any previous claim of 
                privilege or trade secret was denied and, if so, in 
                what proceeding.
            (3) Public inspection.--Within 5 days of receipt of such a 
        log, the Depository shall make it available for public 
        inspection and review.
    (d) Declaration of Compliance.--Each participating tobacco product 
manufacturer shall submit to the Board a declaration, in accordance 
with the requirements of section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, 
by an individual with responsibility for the de novo review of 
documents, preparation of the privilege log, and knowledge of its 
contents. The declarant shall attest to the manufacturer's compliance 
with the requirements of this title pertaining to the review of 
documents and preparation of a privilege log.

SEC. 905. DISCLOSURE BY THE DEPOSITORY.

    (a) In General.--Within 30 days after receipt of a document that is 
not subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work 
product, or trade secret protection, the Depository shall make the 
document available to the public using the Internet and other means.
    (b) Evidentiary Status.--The provisions of section 2116(a) and (b) 
of title 44, United States Code, apply to records and documents 
submitted to the Depository in the same manner and to the same extent 
as if they were records submitted to the National Archives of the 
United States required by statute to be retained indefinitely.
    (c) Application of Confidentiality Law.--The release by the 
National Tobacco Documents Review Board established under section 906 
or any employee of the Depository of any document recognized by the 
Depository as protected as a trade secret is a violation of section 
1905 of title 18, United States Code.

SEC. 906. NATIONAL TOBACCO DOCUMENTS REVIEW BOARD.

    (a) Establishment.--There shall be a National Tobacco Documents 
Review Board consisting of 5 members, qualified by training and 
experience to carry out the functions of the Board, each of whom shall 
be appointed by the President and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate. Any person who is a citizen of the United States shall be 
eligible to serve as a member of the Board. Each Board member shall be 
appointed for a term of 7 years and shall be eligible for 
reappointment. The Board shall have the power to hire such staff and 
establish such operating procedures as it deems necessary to carry out 
its functions as specified hereunder.
    (b) Responsibility for Depository.--The Board shall have the 
responsibility of maintaining the Depository and shall, in consultation 
with the General Services Administration, establish guidelines and 
procedures for the establishment and operation of the Depository, 
including guidelines for the immediate disclosure of documents that are 
not subject to unresolved claims of privilege or trade secrecy. The 
Depository shall be open to the public and maintained in a manner that 
permits it to be used as a resource for litigants, public health 
groups, and persons with an interest in tobacco industry records and 
research concerning smoking and health, addiction or nicotine 
dependency, safer or less hazardous cigarettes, and underage tobacco 
use and marketing. The Board may grant reasonable extensions of time 
for compliance upon a showing of good cause.

and the attorney work-product doctrine in a manner consistent with 
Federal law.

SEC. 907. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTED PRIVILEGE AND TRADE SECRET CLAIMS.

    (a) In General.--The Board shall determine whether to uphold or 
reject disputed claims of attorney client privilege, attorney work 
product, or trade secret protection with respect to documents submitted 
to the Depository. Any person may petition the Board to resolve a claim 
that a document submitted to the Depository may not be disclosed to the 
public. Such a determination shall be made by a majority of the Board, 
in writing, and shall be subject to judicial review as specified in 
this title. All such determinations shall be made solely on 
consideration of the subject document and written submissions from the 
person claiming that the document is privileged or protected by trade 
secrecy and from any person seeking disclosure of the document. The 
Board shall cause notice of the petition and the Board's decision to be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Final Decision.--The Board may uphold a claim of privilege or 
protection in its entirety or, in its sole discretion, it may redact 
that portion of a document that it determines is protected from public 
disclosure under subsection (a). Any decision of the Board shall be 
final unless judicial review is sought under section 908. In the event 
that judicial review is so sought, the Board's decision shall be stayed 
pending a final judicial decision.

SEC. 908. APPEAL OF BOARD DECISION.

    (a) Petition; Right of Appeal.--Any person may obtain judicial 
review of a final decision of the Board by filing a petition for review 
with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within 
60 days after the publication of such decision in the Federal Register. 
A copy of the petition shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the Court 
to the Board. The Board shall file in the court the record of the 
proceedings on which the Board based its decision (including any 
documents reviewed by the Board in camera) as provided in section 2112 
of title 28, United States Code. Upon the filing of such petition, the 
court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm or set aside the 
Board's decision, except that until the filing of the record the Board 
may modify or set aside its decision.
    (b) Additional Evidence and Arguments.--If the any party applies to 
the court for leave to adduce additional evidence respecting the 
decision being reviewed and shows to the satisfaction of the court that 
such additional evidence or arguments are material and that there were 
reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence or arguments 
in the proceedings before the Board, the court may order the Board to 
provide additional opportunity for the presentation of evidence or 
arguments in such manner and upon such terms as the court deems proper. 
The Board may modify its findings or make new findings by reason of the 
additional evidence or arguments and shall file with the court such 
modified or new findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the 
modification or setting aside of the decision being reviewed.
    (c) Standard of Review; Finality of Judgments.--The Board's 
findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record 
taken as a whole, shall be conclusive. The court shall review the 
Board's legal conclusions de novo. The judgment of the court affirming 
or setting aside the Board's decision shall be final, subject to review 
by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or 
certification, as provided in section 1254 of title 28, United States 
Code.
    (d) Public Disclosure After Final Decision.--Within 30 days after a 
final decision that a document, as redacted by the Board or in its 
entirety, is not protected from disclosure by a claim of attorney-
client privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret protection, 
the Board shall direct the Depository to make the document available to 
the public. No Federal, Tribal, or State court shall have jurisdiction 
to review a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, 
or trade secret protection for a document that has lawfully been made 
available to the public under this subsection.
    (e) Effect of Non-Disclosure Decision on Judicial Proceedings.--The 
Board's decision that a document is protected by attorney-client 
privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret protection is binding 
only for the purpose of protecting the document from disclosure by the 
Depository. The decision by the Board shall not be construed to prevent 
a document from being disclosed in a judicial proceeding.
    (f) Disclosure to the Food and Drug Administration.--Within 240 
days after the date of enactment of this Act, each participating 
tobacco product manufacturer shall submit to the Food and Drug 
Administration the documents identified in section 903(b) or 903(c), 
including documents for which trade secret protection is claimed, with 
the exception of any document for which privilege is claimed, and 
identified in accordance with section 904(a). Each such manufacturer 
shall provide the Administration with the privilege and trade secret 
logs identified under section 904(b). With respect to documents that 
are claimed to contain trade secret material, unless and until it is 
finally determined under this title, either through judicial review or 
because time for judicial review has expired, that such a document does 
not constitute or contain trade secret material, the Administration 
shall treat the document as a trade secret in accordance with section 
708 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379) and the 
regulations promulgated thereunder. Nothing herein shall limit the 
authority of the Administration to obtain and use, in accordance with 
any provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the 
regulations promulgated thereunder, any document constituting or 
containing trade secret material. Documents and materials received by 
the Administration under this provision shall not be obtainable by or 
releasable to the public through section 552 of title 5, United States 
Code, or any other provision of law, and the only recourse to obtain 
these documents shall be through the Board and Depository.

SEC. 909. MISCELLANEOUS.

    The disclosure process in this title is not intended to affect the 
Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or any Federal law which 
requires the disclosure of documents or which deals with attorney-
client privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret protection.

SEC. 910. PENALTIES.

    (a) Good Faith Requirement.--Each participating tobacco product 
manufacturer must act in good faith in asseting claims of privilege or 
trade secret protection based on fact and law. If the Board determines 
that a participating tobacco product manufacturer has not acted in good 
faith with full knowledge of the truth of the facts asserted and with a 
reasonable basis under existing law, the manufacturer shall be assessed 
costs, which shall include the full administrative costs of handling 
the claim of privilege, and all attorneys' fees incurred by the Board 
and any party contesting the privilege. The Board may also impose civil 
penalties of up to $10,000 per violation if it determines that the 
manufacturer acted in bad faith in asserting a privilege, or knowingly 
acted with the intent to delay, frustrate, defraud, or obstruct the 
Board's determination of privilege or trade secret protection claims.
    (b) Failure to Produce Document.--A failure by a participating 
tobacco product manufacturer to produce indexes and documents in 
compliance with the schedule set forth in this title, or with such 
extension as may be granted by the Board, shall be punished by a civil 
penalty of up to $500 per violation. A separate violation occurs for 
each document the manufacturer has failed to produce in a timely 
manner. The maximum penalty under this subsection for a related series 
of violations is $10,000. In determining the amount of any civil 
penalty, the Board shall consider the number of documents, length of 
delay, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, and such 
other matters as justice requires. Nothing in this title shall replace 
or supersede any criminal sanction under title 18, United States Code, 
or any other provision of law.

                quota lessee, or quota tenant shall be determined in 
                accordance with this subsection (based on a poundage

                        quota or allotment for the 1995 through 1997

                    (B) Yields not available.--If the average yield per 
                acre is not available for a farm, the Secretary shall 
                calculate the base quota for the quota holder, quota 
                lessee, or quota tenant (based on a poundage 
                conversion) by determining the amount equal to the 
                product obtained by multiplying--
                            (i) the average tobacco farm marketing 
                        quota or allotment for the 1995 through 1997

                through 1997 marketing years, the Secretary shall make 
                payments for lost tobacco quota to each quota holder

                        is less than the base quota level for the quota 
                        holder; and
                            (ii) $4 per pound.
                    (B) Poundage conversion for marketing quotas other 
                than poundage quotas.--

                        for which there is a marketing quota or 
                        allotment (on an acreage basis), the poundage 
                        conversion for each quota holder during a 
                        marketing year shall be determined by 
                        multiplying--
                                    (I) the basic farm acreage 
                                allotment for the farm for the 
                                marketing year; and

                        yield per acre is not available for a farm, the 
                        Secretary shall calculate the poundage 
                        conversion for each quota holder during a 
                        marketing year by multiplying--
                                    (I) the basic farm acreage

        secondary school diplomas or the recognized equivalent to 
        benefit from the instruction offered by institutions utilizing 
        the process, and shall also take into account the cultural

        student's eligibility to receive a grant under this subpart may 
be reduced if a financial aid officer determines under the 
discretionary authority provided in section 479A that

cooperation with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall verify any 
social security number provided by a student to an eligible institution

        paragraphs (2) and (3), an institution shall not deny, reduce, 
        delay, or terminate a student's eligibility for assistance 
        under this subpart because social security number verification 
        is pending.
            ``(2) Denial or termination.--If there is a determination 
        by the Secretary that the social security number provided to an

        appropriation Acts.

SEC. 1132. AMERICAN CENTER ON GLOBAL HEALTH AND TOBACCO.

    (a) Findings and Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
                    (A) Tobacco use is estimated to have caused nearly 
                3,000,000 deaths a year worldwide in the early 1990's, 
                and is projected to cause in excess of 10,000,000 
                additional deaths a year globally by 2030, more than 
                any single disease. More than 70 percent of those 
                deaths are expected in developing countries.
                    (B) Many countries are unprepared to address 
                increases in tobacco deaths, including the impact on 
                health systems and health costs. While tobacco 
                consumption in the United States and other established 
                market economies has fallen over the last decade, 
                consumption is rising in China, India, East Asia, and 
                former socialist economies. Tobacco companies in the 
                United States and elsewhere have increasingly targeted 
                those markets.
                    (C) Tobacco use markedly reduces good health and 
                threatens to erode the major health gains in life 
                expectancy of the last century. Only HIV/AIDS infection 
                and tobacco are large and growing causes of death and 
                disease worldwide. The total projected deaths from 
                tobacco over the next 10 years likely will exceed 
                deaths from HIV/AIDS, maternal and childhood 
                conditions, and tuberculosis combined.
                    (D) The United States consistently has provided 
                leadership and funding to address the world's most 
                pressing public health needs, including HIV/AIDS, 
                hunger, maternal and child health, and immunization.
                    (E) Through exports and overseas operations, United 
                States tobacco companies sell more cigarettes overseas 
                than they do in the United States. Foreign sales now 
                account for more than half of all sales for the 2 
                leading United States tobacco product manufacturers.
                    (F) United States companies spend billions of 
                dollars on aggressive tobacco marketing campaigns 
                overseas that associate smoking with the United States, 
                affluence, freedom, and liberation. In many markets, 
                American companies reach youthful audiences through 
                television and radio advertising, free samples, and 
                other methods that are outlawed in the United States.
                    (G) In light of the role the United States tobacco 
                companies have played in spreading tobacco use 
                globally, and in light of the large financial benefits 
                they continue to enjoy from tobacco exports, it is 
                appropriate that this section be enacted in order to 
                provide assistance and funding for international public 
                education and mass media programs to inform the public 
                about the hazards of tobacco use.
                    (H) Smoking in United States films is pervasive and 
                influences persons in other countries who seek to 
                emulate ``American activities'' depicted in motion 
                pictures. According to one study, more than half of the 
                top-grossing United States films released between 1991 
                and 1996 exhibited smoking. In these films, 80 percent 
                of the male lead characters and 27 percent of the 
                female characters smoked. The motion picture industry 
                is painting a distorted picture that smoking is a truly 
                American activity.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish 
        the American Center on Global Health and Tobacco (herein after 
        referred to as ``ACT''). ACT shall assist organizations in 
        other countries to reduce and prevent the use of tobacco. 
        Activities ACT shall support include--
                    (A) public education programs that inform the 
                public about the hazards of tobacco use and of 
                environmental tobacco smoke;
                    (B) mass media campaigns, including paid counter-
                tobacco advertisements, to reverse the image appeal of 
                pro-tobacco messages, especially those that glamorize 
                and ``Westernize'' tobacco use to young people; and
                    (C) education about the economic and societal costs 
                of tobacco use, and effective tobacco use prevention 
                and cessation strategies that are appropriate for the 
                country involved.
    (b) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--There is hereby established in the 
        District of Columbia a private, nonprofit corporation to be 
        known as the American Center on Global Health and Tobacco. ACT 
        shall--
                    (A) not be an agency or establishment of the United 
                States; and
                    (B) except as otherwise provided in this section, 
                be subject to, and have all the powers conferred upon a 
                nonprofit corporation by the District of Columbia 
                Nonprofit Corporation Act (D.C. Code section 29-501 et 
                seq.).
            (2) Relation to united states.--Nothing in this section 
        shall be construed as making ACT an agency or establishment of 
        the United States, or as making the members of the Board of 
        ACT, or its employees, officers or employees of the United 
        States.
            (3) Relation to nongovernmental organizations.--ACT shall 
        have a limited staff, and, to the maximum extent practicable, 
        utilize the available experience and talents of nongovernmental 
        organizations with specialized experience in health, education, 
        media, and tobacco.
            (4) Governing board.--ACT shall be governed by a board of 
        up to 25 members including--
                    (A) on a bipartisan basis, Members of the Senate 
                and of the House of Representatives;
                    (B) the heads of American public health 
                organizations;

                other nongovernment institutions and corporations; and
                    (D) individuals active in education, public health, 
                and other relevant activities.
            (5) International advisory council.--An International 
        Advisory Council consisting of representatives from key global, 
        regional, and national public health organizations, and leading 
        individual educators and health professionals shall provide 
        advisory assistance to ACT.
    (c) Funding.--
            (1) Definition of trust fund.--In this section, the term 
        ``Trust Fund'' means the National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund 
        established by section 401 of this Act, other than amounts in 
        the State Litigation Settlement Account.
            (2) Establishment of global public health and education 
        resource account.--There is established within the Trust Fund 
        the Global Public Health and Education Resource Account that 
        shall be credited with $150,000,000 for each fiscal year.
            (3) Transfer authority.--The Secretary of the Treasury 
        shall on October 1 of each fiscal year beginning after the date 
        of enactment of this section, transfer $150,000,000 from the

        authorized under this section.
            (4) Termination of transfer authority.--The authority of

            (2) Compliance.--
                    (A) Funding contingent on compliance.--Annual 
                payments from the Trust Fund may be made to ACT under 
                this section only if ACT complies with the requirements 
                specified in this section.
                    (B) Use of funds.--ACT may only fund programs for 
                private sector groups, and may not carry out programs 
                directly. ACT may provide funding only for programs

        this section that have not been the subject of a request and 
        direction to be paid for a period of 2 years from the date on 
        which such credits are made available, such unused credits 
        shall be reallocated proportionally to each asbestos trust and

        the Secretary in connection with the injury or disease

        participating tobacco product manufacturer, distributor, or 
        retailer of a tobacco product who is liable for the injury or 
        disease, in a State or Federal court, either alone (in its own 
        name or in the name of the injured veteran, his or her 
        guardian, personal representative, estate, dependents, or 
        survivors) or in conjunction with the injured or diseased 
        veteran, his or her guardian, personal representative, estate,

        claim which the Secretary has by virtue of the right 
        established by section 9101 of this title; or
            ``(2) waive any such claim, in whole or in part, for the 
        convenience of the Government, or if he or she determines that 
        collection would result in undue hardship upon the veteran who
