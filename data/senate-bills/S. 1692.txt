of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice medicine and 
surgery by the State in which the doctor performs such activity, or any 
other individual legally authorized by the State to perform abortions:

receives a partial-birth abortion procedure, and if the mother has not 
attained the age of 18 years at the time of the abortion, the maternal 
grandparents of the fetus, may in a civil action obtain appropriate 
relief, unless the pregnancy resulted from the plaintiff's criminal 
conduct or the plaintiff consented to the abortion.
    ``(2) Such relief shall include--
            ``(A) money damages for all injuries, psychological and 
        physical, occasioned by the violation of this section; and

        the partial-birth abortion.
    ``(d)(1) A defendant accused of an offense under this section may 
seek a hearing before the State Medical Board on whether the 
physician's conduct was necessary to save the life of the mother whose 
life was endangered by a physical disorder, illness or injury.
    ``(2) The findings on that issue are admissible on that issue at 
the trial of the defendant. Upon a motion of the defendant, the court 
shall delay the beginning of the trial for not more than 30 days to 
permit such a hearing to take place.
