                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to the deadly terrorist 
  attacks against the people of Spain that occurred on March 11, 2004.

Whereas on March 11, 2004, terrorists detonated a total of 10 bombs at 6 train 
        stations in and around Madrid, Spain during morning rush hour, killing 
        more than 190 people and injuring more than 1,200 others;
Whereas these attacks constitute the worst acts of terrorism ever experienced in 
        Spain;
Whereas no organization has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks;
Whereas the terrorist organization known as ETA, which has been responsible for 
        the deaths of more than 800 people during its decades long campaign to 
        establish an independent Basque State, is a prime suspect as the 
        perpetrator of these cowardly acts of terrorism against innocent people;
Whereas officials in Spain initiated another line of investigation to identify 
        the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks after a van was found with 
        detonators and an Arabic-language tape of Koranic verses;
Whereas President Jose Maria Aznar has stated that ``we shall not forget'', 
        bravely declared that Spain would not change its policies because of 
        terrorist pressure, and declared three days of national mourning;
Whereas the President of the European Parliament has stated that the terrorist 
        attacks are ``a declaration of war on democracy'', Pope John Paul II has 
        described the attacks as ``despicable'', and the United Nations 
        Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed profound shock and indignation 
        over this ``senseless killing of innocent people''; and
Whereas President George W. Bush has already called President Aznar to offer his 
        condolences and to assure him that ``the United States stands resolutely 
        with Spain in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and against 
        the particular threat that Spain faces from the evil of ETA terrorism'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses the outrage and shock of the people of the 
        United States over the terrorist attacks that occurred in and 
        around Madrid, Spain on March 11, 2004;
            (2) joins with President Bush in expressing its deepest 
        condolences and pledges to remain shoulder to shoulder with the 
        people of Spain in the war on terrorism;
            (3) expresses its strong solidarity with the people of 
        Spain during their difficult hour, and its deep condolences to 
        the families of the victims of these despicable terrorist 
        attacks;
            (4) calls on all nations to join with the United States in 
        condemning the monstrous attacks on the innocent people of 
        Spain and in attempting to identify the perpetrators of the 
        attacks and bring them to account;
            (5) expresses its readiness to consult with representatives 
        of King Juan Carlos, President Jose Maria Aznar, the Spanish 
        government, the Spanish Cortes, and other public authorities 
        about joint efforts to combat terrorism more effectively;
            (6) commends the United States Embassy in Madrid for its 
        prompt offers of assistance to the Government of Spain, and for 
        its efforts to determine the welfare and whereabouts of United 
        States citizens who may have been affected by the terrorist 
        attacks; and
            (7) urges the executive branch to continue to provide all 
        possible assistance to Spain in order to identify and bring to 
        account the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks that occurred 
        on March 11, 2004, in Madrid and of other terrorist attacks 
        against the people of Spain.
