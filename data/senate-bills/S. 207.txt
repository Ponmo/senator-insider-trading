 Act. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), such fees shall

 [Struck out->]   (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b)(1) Each contract market shall maintain and utilize a
 system to monitor trading to detect and deter violations of the contract
 market's rules and regulations committed in the making of trades and the
 execution of customer orders on the floor or subject to the rules of such
 contract market. The system shall include-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) physical observation of trading areas; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) audit trail and recordkeeping systems able to capture
 essential data on the terms, participants, and sequence of transactions
 (including relevant data on unmatched trades and out-trades); [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) systems capable of and used to review data on trades
 effectively on a regular basis to detect violations committed in making
 trades and executing customer orders on the floor or subject to the rules
 of such contract market, including-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) all types of violations attributable to dual trading;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) to the full extent feasible as deter- mined by the
 Commission, all other types of violations involving the making of trades
 and the execution of customer orders; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(D) the use of information gathered through such system
 on a consistent basis to bring appropriate disciplinary actions against
 violators; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(E) the commitment of resources to such system necessary
 for such system to be effective in detecting and deterring such violations,
 including adequate staff to develop and prosecute disciplinary actions;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(F) the assessment of meaningful penalties against violators
 and the referral of appropriate cases to the Commission. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) The audit trail system of the contract market shall
 accurately record-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) the times of trades in increments of no more than 1
 minute in length; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) the sequence of trades for each floor trader and
 broker, consistent with Commission regulations. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) Beginning 3 years after the date of enactment of
 this subsection, the audit trail system of the contract market shall--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) for all trades, record accurately and promptly the
 essential data on terms, participants, and times as required by the Commission
 by rule, including the time of execution of such trade, through a means that--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) records such data in a form which cannot be altered
 except in a manner that will leave a complete and independent record of
 such alteration; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) continually provides such data to the contract market;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iii) identifies such time, to the extent practicable as
 determined by the Commission-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(I) independently of the person making the trade;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) through a mechanism that records the time automatically
 when entered by the person making the trade; or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(III) through such other means that will capture a
 similarly reliable time; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iv) is adequately precise to determine, to the extent
 practicable as determined by the Commission by rule or order-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(I) the sequence of all trades by each floor trader; and
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) the sequence of all trades by each floor broker;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) to the extent practicable as determined by the
 Commission by rule or order, for customer trades, record the time that
 each order is received on the floor of the board of trade, is received by
 the floor broker for execution (or when such order is transmitted in an
 extremely rapid manner to the broker), and is reported from the floor of
 the board of trade as executed, through a means that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) records such times in a form which cannot be altered
 except in a manner that will leave a complete and independent record of
 such alteration; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) continually provides such data to the contract market;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iii) identifies such time-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(I) independently of the person making the trade or
 processing the order; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) through a mechanism that records the time automatically
 when entered by the person making the trade or processing such order,
 as appropriate; or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(III) through such other means as will capture a similarly
 reliable time; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iv) is adequately precise to determine-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(I) the sequence in which, for each futures commission
 merchant, floor broker, or member firm, as applicable, all orders are received
 on and reported from the floor of the contract market; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) the sequence in which orders are received by each
 floor broker for execution. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) The Commission may, by rule, establish standards under
 which the audit trail systems required under paragraph (3) shall record,
 to the extent practicable-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) the sequence of all trades made by all floor traders
 and floor brokers; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) the interval between the time of receipt and the time
 of execution of each order by the floor broker. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(5) The Commission shall, by rule or order, make
 exemptions to the extent appropriate from the requirements of paragraph (3)--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) for an exchange with respect to which the Commission
 finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) the volume of trading on such exchange is relatively
 small and the exchange has demonstrated substantial compliance with the
 objectives of such paragraph; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) the trade monitoring system at such exchange otherwise
 maintains a high level of compliance with this subsection; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) for categories of customer orders with respect to which
 the Commission finds that such orders are transmitted to and reported from
 the trading pit in an extremely rapid manner such that substantial compliance
 with the objectives of paragraph (3) can be otherwise achieved. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(6) Any rule or order adopted by the Commission under
 paragraphs (4) and (5) shall become effective 30 legislative days or 90
 calendar days, whichever is later, after submission of such rule or order
 to Congress.'. [<-Struck out]

 out]
 [Struck out->]   `(a) ASSESSMENTS- Not later than 18 months after the date
 of enactment of this section, and at least once every 2 years thereafter,
 the Commission shall assess whether the trade monitoring system of each
 contract market satisfies section 5a(b). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) ORDERS-  [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) CAUSES- The Commission shall issue a proposed deficiency
 order in accordance with paragraph (2) if, based on its assessment or on other
 in formation, the Commission at any time has reason to believe that a contract
 market's trade monitoring system implemented pursuant to section 5a(b) does
 not satisfy one or more of the requirements of such section. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) CONTENTS- A proposed order issued under this subsection
 shall specify-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) the deficiencies the Commission has reason to believe
 exist in the trade monitoring system of the contract market and a statement
 of reasons supporting the Commission's belief that those deficiencies exist;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) the corrective action that the Commission believes
 that the contract market must take and an acceptable timetable for such
 corrective action; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) a date, not less than 20 days from the date of
 issuance of the proposed order, when such order will become final, subject
 to subsection (d). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) REMEDIES- On becoming final, the Commission order
 may require the contract market to-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) institute appropriate improvements in its trade
 monitoring system necessary to correct the deficiencies noted therein;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) satisfy stated objective performance criteria to
 correct such deficiencies; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) upgrade or reconfigure existing systems for collecting
 or processing relevant data on trading and trader or broker activity,
 including, where appropriate, the commitment of additional resources;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(D) suspend the privilege of dual trading in such contract
 market, if the deficiency noted in such order relates to the prevention,
 detection, or disciplining of violations attributable to such trading at
 such contract market, subject to the standards, exceptions, and duration
 provisions of subsection (c); or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(E) take any combination of the actions described in
 subparagraphs (A) through (D). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) REMOVAL- If the Commission finds, after notice and
 opportunity for a hearing on the record prior to such order becoming final,
 that a named officer, director, committee member, or employee of such
 contract market has willfully-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) violated this Act, the rules or regulations of the
 Commission thereunder, or the rules of such contract market; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) abused the authority of such person; or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) without reasonable justification or excuse has failed
 to enforce compliance with any provision of the rules of such contract market
 by any member or person associated with a member thereof; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] the Commission may issue an order under this section to
 remove such officer, director, committee member, or employee. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(5) DESIGNATION AS CONTRACT MARKET- Notwithstanding section
 6, during the period that a proposed or final order under this section is
 in effect, the Commission may refrain from approving any application for
 designation as a contract market made by the exchange whose contract market
 is the subject of such order. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(6) DELEGATION- The Commission shall not delegate the
 authority to issue orders under this subsection. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(c) DUAL TRADING-  [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) IN GENERAL- Within 18 months after the date of
 enactment of this section, the Commission shall initiate proceedings to
 suspend the privilege of dual trading on each contract market, pursuant to
 an order issued under subsection (b) that becomes final under subsection
 (d), unless the Commission determines, as part of the first assessment made
 of such contract market under subsection (a), that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) the trade monitoring system in place at the contract
 market satisfies the requirements of section 5a(b), such that such system is
 capable of and is being used to detect and bring appropriate disciplinary
 actions with regard to violations attributable to dual trading at such
 contract market; or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B)(i) there is a substantial likelihood that a dual
 trading suspension would harm the public interest in hedging and price
 basing at such contract market; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) other remedies under subsection (b) are more
 appropriate. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) EXCEPTIONS- A Commission order suspending dual trading
 may provide for exceptions to ensure fairness and orderly trading in such
 contract market (including, where appropriate, a reasonable phase-in period,
 a limitation of the suspension to specified contracts, exceptions for certain
 spread transactions, corrections of trading errors, or allowing a customer
 to designate in writing not less than once annually a named floor broker
 to execute orders for such customer). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) DURATION- Such suspension shall remain in effect
 until the Commission makes the finding required under paragraph (1). The
 Commission shall act expeditiously to consider making such finding upon
 any demonstration by the contract market under paragraph (1). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(d) RESCISSION, MODIFICATION, OR DELAY OF ORDERS- Before
 any proposed deficiency order issued by the Commission under subsection
 (b) may become final, the Commission shall-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) provide the affected contract market with an opportunity
 for a hearing through submission of written data, views, or arguments and,
 under terms set by the Commission at the request of the contract market,
 through an oral presentation of views and comments to the Commission, in
 order to petition the Commission to rescind, modify, or delay such order;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) rule on such petition, not less than 20 days before
 the order takes effect, making findings, as appropriate, as to whether--

 in considering whether the contract market should take any significant
 action that would not be submitted to the Commission for its prior approval,
 including the adoption of any nonphysical emergency rule (but excluding

 board or committee must abstain from participating in the matter before the
 board or committee due to positions of such member, or positions, including
 customer positions, held at any firm with which such member is affiliated,
 in the futures or option contract that is the subject of the matter before
 the board or committee. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(D) If any board or committee considers whether to direct

 storage facilities at such delivery points contribute to consistency and
 reasonableness in price discovery in the contract market; [<-Struck out]

 contracts of sale for future delivery would be feasible and would further
 the public interest in hedging and price basing for agricultural commodities;

 delivery are raised by the participation in such contracts of international
 corporations whose commercial needs for physical commodities may be global;

 the Comptroller General determines relevant to the efficient operation and

 [Struck out->] TITLE III--INTERMARKET COORDINATION [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   This title may be cited as the `Intermarket Coordination
 Act of 1991'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 302. AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL
 RESERVE SYSTEM OVER MARGIN ON STOCK INDEX FUTURES. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (a) IN GENERAL- The Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is amended
 by adding at the end the following new section: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] `SEC. 24. AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL
 RESERVE SYSTEM OVER MARGIN ON STOCK INDEX FUTURES. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
 has authority to prescribe rules and regulations with respect to margin for
 securities (other than exempted securities) and options on those securities
 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) and
 has other important responsibilities with respect to credit, banking,
 and finance; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
 is well placed to-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) exercise margin authority with respect to each segment
 of the overall inter-dependent market system for establishing prices for
 equity securities and related products-equity securities, futures, and
 related options; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) assess the prudential impact of margin levels on the
 participants and institutions within each such segment; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) assess the potential for systemic risk that may arise
 as a result of margin levels in any such segment; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(D) take account, in any such assessment, of the respective
 roles and structure of margin in each segment and its impact on prudential
 risk; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(E) apply a consistent viewpoint on the nature and magnitude
 of systemic and prudential risk in making judgments with respect to margin
 in each such segment and its effect on the maintenance of orderly markets;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) it is appropriate and in the public interest to
 assign authority over margin for contracts of sale for future delivery of
 groups or indices of equity securities (and options thereon) to the Board
 of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, consistent with the authority
 that Congress has assigned to the Board to prescribe rules and regulations
 with respect to margin for securities (other than exempted securities)
 and options on those securities. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) IN GENERAL- The Board of Governors of the Federal
 Reserve System shall prescribe rules with respect to the margin that may
 be initially required and subsequently maintained on contracts of sale
 for future delivery of a group or index of equity securities (or options
 thereon). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(c) STANDARDS- In adopting the rules, the Board--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) shall consider-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) the protection of the financial integrity of clearing
 organizations, contract markets, futures commission merchants, or related
 firms or financial institutions from default by participants in the markets
 on their payment or performance obligations; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) the findings of this section; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) the legislative findings set forth in section 3; and
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) consistent with the findings and standards of this
 section, may make appropriate provision with respect to (including special
 or different margin requirements for) transactions or positions engendering a
 lesser degree of prudential risk, including hedges, positions held by members
 of contract markets who have other forms of collateral available to cover
 their performance or payment obligations, spread or arbitrage positions,
 and other appropriate positions. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(d) VIOLATIONS- Except for purposes of sections 14 and
 22, a failure to assess margin in accord with any rule or regulation of
 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System adopted under this
 section shall be a violation of this Act. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(e) DELEGATION- The Board, at the Board's sole discretion
 and subject to such conditions as the Board may determine, may adopt rules
 pursuant to subsection (b) under which the margin required may be the
 amount specified by the rules of the respective designated contract market,
 if all such rules have been approved or amended by-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) the Board; or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) not earlier than 30 months after the date of enactment
 of this section, the Commission under sections 5a(a)(12) and 8a(7), if the
 Board, in the Board's sole discretion and subject to such conditions as
 the Board may determine, so provides.'. [<-Struck out]

 of this Act) is further amended-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (A) by inserting `(A)' after the paragraph designation;
 and [<-Struck out]

 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B)(i) notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and consistent
 with the standards and findings of section 24, with respect to any rule of
 a contract market-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(I) setting levels of margin for contracts of sale for
 future delivery on a group or index of equity securities (or options thereon)
 adopted pursuant to a rule of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
 System under section 24; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) where the rule of the Board of Governors of the
 Federal Reserve System so provides, [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] the contract market shall inform the Commission of the rule
 immediately on the adoption of the rule. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) The contract market may implement the rule without
 receiving prior approval of the Commission, unless the Commission, at any time
 before or after the rule has been implemented until 10 days after receipt
 of the rule by the Commission, informs the contract market in writing of
 the determination of the Commission to review the rule for approval. The
 Commission shall review the rule in accordance with the procedures of
 subparagraph (A).'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) Section 8a(7) is amended-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) through (F) as

 [Struck out->]   (B) by inserting `(A)' after the paragraph designation;

 with the standards and findings of section 24, the Commission may alter or
 supplement rules setting levels of margin for contracts of sale for future
 delivery on a group or index of equity securities (or options thereon)
 adopted pursuant to a rule of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
 System under section 24, if the rule of the Board of Governors of the
 Federal Reserve System so provides. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall
 comply with the procedures set forth in subparagraph (A).'. [<-Struck out]

 of 1934. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(II) Any transaction conducted on a designated contract
 market (or accounts and agreements related to the transactions) excepted
 from the exclusion in subclause (I) shall be governed solely pursuant to
 this Act. Any transaction excluded under subclause (I) from the jurisdiction

  (1) by inserting `(a)' after the section designation; and
  (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
  `(b)(1) Each contract market shall maintain and utilize a system to monitor
  trading to detect and deter violations of the contract market's rules and
  regulations committed in the making of trades and the execution of customer
  orders on the floor or subject to the rules of such contract market. The
  system shall include--
  `(A) physical observation of trading areas;

  on the terms, participants, and sequence of transactions (including relevant
  data on unmatched trades and out-trades);
  `(C) systems capable of and used to review data on trades effectively
  on a regular basis to detect violations committed in making trades and
  executing customer orders on the floor or subject to the rules of such
  contract market, including--
  `(i) all types of violations attributable to dual trading; and
  `(ii) to the full extent feasible as deter- mined by the Commission, all
  other types of violations involving the making of trades and the execution
  of customer orders;
  `(D) the use of information gathered through such system on a consistent
  basis to bring appropriate disciplinary actions against violators;
  `(E) the commitment of resources to such system necessary for such system
  to be effective in detecting and deterring such violations, including
  adequate staff to develop and prosecute disciplinary actions; and
  `(F) the assessment of meaningful penalties against violators and the
  referral of appropriate cases to the Commission.
  `(2) The audit trail system of the contract market shall accurately record--
  `(A) the times of trades in increments of no more than 1 minute in length;
  and
  `(B) the sequence of trades for each floor trader and broker, consistent
  with Commission regulations.
  `(3) Beginning 3 years after the date of enactment of this subsection,
  the audit trail system of the contract market shall--
  `(A) for all trades, record accurately and promptly the essential data
  on terms, participants, and times as required by the Commission by rule,
  including the time of execution of such trade, through a means that--
  `(i) records such data in a form which cannot be altered except in a manner
  that will leave a complete and independent record of such alteration;
  `(ii) continually provides such data to the contract market;
  `(iii) identifies such time, to the extent practicable as determined by
  the Commission--
  `(I) independently of the person making the trade;
  `(II) through a mechanism that records the time automatically when entered
  by the person making the trade; or
  `(III) through such other means that will capture a similarly reliable
  time; and
  `(iv) is adequately precise to determine, to the extent practicable as
  determined by the Commission by rule or order--
  `(I) the sequence of all trades by each floor trader; and
  `(II) the sequence of all trades by each floor broker; and
  `(B) to the extent practicable as determined by the Commission by rule or
  order, for customer trades, record the time that each order is received
  on the floor of the board of trade, is received by the floor broker for
  execution (or when such order is transmitted in an extremely rapid manner
  to the broker), and is reported from the floor of the board of trade as
  executed, through a means that--
  `(i) records such times in a form which cannot be altered except in a
  manner that will leave a complete and independent record of such alteration;
  `(ii) continually provides such data to the contract market;
  `(iii) identifies such time--
  `(I) independently of the person making the trade or processing the order;
  `(II) through a mechanism that records the time automatically when entered
  by the person making the trade or processing such order, as appropriate; or
  `(III) through such other means as will capture a similarly reliable
  time; and
  `(iv) is adequately precise to determine--
  `(I) the sequence in which, for each futures commission merchant, floor
  broker, or member firm, as applicable, all orders are received on and
  reported from the floor of the contract market; and
  `(II) the sequence in which orders are received by each floor broker
  for execution.
  `(4) The Commission may, by rule, establish standards under which the
  audit trail systems required under paragraph (3) shall record, to the
  extent practicable--
  `(A) the sequence of all trades made by all floor traders and floor
  brokers; and
  `(B) the interval between the time of receipt and the time of execution
  of each order by the floor broker.
  `(5) The Commission shall, by rule or order, make exemptions to the extent
  appropriate from the requirements of paragraph (3)--
  `(A) for an exchange with respect to which the Commission finds that--
  `(i) the volume of trading on such exchange is relatively small and the
  exchange has demonstrated substantial compliance with the objectives of
  such paragraph; and
  `(ii) the trade monitoring system at such exchange otherwise maintains a
  high level of compliance with this subsection; and
  `(B) for categories of customer orders with respect to which the Commission
  finds that such orders are transmitted to and reported from the trading
  pit in an extremely rapid manner such that substantial compliance with
  the objectives of paragraph (3) can be otherwise achieved.
  `(6) Any rule or order adopted by the Commission under paragraphs (4)
  and (5) shall become effective 30 legislative days or 90 calendar days,
  whichever is later, after submission of such rule or order to Congress.'.

  this section, and at least once every 2 years thereafter, the Commission
  shall assess whether the trade monitoring system of each contract market
  satisfies section 5a(b).
  `(b) ORDERS-
  `(1) CAUSES- The Commission shall issue a proposed deficiency order in
  accordance with paragraph (2) if, based on its assessment or on other in
  formation, the Commission at any time has reason to believe that a contract
  market's trade monitoring system implemented pursuant to section 5a(b)
  does not satisfy one or more of the requirements of such section.
  `(2) CONTENTS- A proposed order issued under this subsection shall specify--
  `(A) the deficiencies the Commission has reason to believe exist in the
  trade monitoring system of the contract market and a statement of reasons
  supporting the Commission's belief that those deficiencies exist;
  `(B) the corrective action that the Commission believes that the contract
  market must take and an acceptable timetable for such corrective action; and
  `(C) a date, not less than 20 days from the date of issuance of the proposed
  order, when such order will become final, subject to subsection (d).
  `(3) REMEDIES- On becoming final, the Commission order may require the
  contract market to--
  `(A) institute appropriate improvements in its trade monitoring system
  necessary to correct the deficiencies noted therein;
  `(B) satisfy stated objective performance criteria to correct such
  deficiencies;
  `(C) upgrade or reconfigure existing systems for collecting or processing
  relevant data on trading and trader or broker activity, including, where
  appropriate, the commitment of additional resources;
  `(D) suspend the privilege of dual trading in such contract market, if
  the deficiency noted in such order relates to the prevention, detection,
  or disciplining of violations attributable to such trading at such contract
  market, subject to the standards, exceptions, and duration provisions of
  subsection (c); or
  `(E) take any combination of the actions described in subparagraphs (A)
  through (D).
  `(4) REMOVAL- If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for
  a hearing on the record prior to such order becoming final, that a named
  officer, director, committee member, or employee of such contract market
  has willfully--
  `(A) violated this Act, the rules or regulations of the Commission
  thereunder, or the rules of such contract market;
  `(B) abused the authority of such person; or
  `(C) without reasonable justification or excuse has failed to enforce
  compliance with any provision of the rules of such contract market by any
  member or person associated with a member thereof;
the Commission may issue an order under this section to remove such officer,
director, committee member, or employee.
  `(5) DESIGNATION AS CONTRACT MARKET- Notwithstanding section 6, during
  the period that a proposed or final order under this section is in effect,
  the Commission may refrain from approving any application for designation
  as a contract market made by the exchange whose contract market is the
  subject of such order.
  `(6) DELEGATION- The Commission shall not delegate the authority to issue
  orders under this subsection.
  `(c) DUAL TRADING-
  `(1) IN GENERAL- Within 18 months after the date of enactment of this
  section, the Commission shall initiate proceedings to suspend the privilege
  of dual trading on each contract market, pursuant to an order issued
  under subsection (b) that becomes final under subsection (d), unless
  the Commission determines, as part of the first assessment made of such
  contract market under subsection (a), that--
  `(A) the trade monitoring system in place at the contract market satisfies
  the requirements of section 5a(b), such that such system is capable of and
  is being used to detect and bring appropriate disciplinary actions with
  regard to violations attributable to dual trading at such contract market; or
  `(B)(i) there is a substantial likelihood that a dual trading suspension
  would harm the public interest in hedging and price basing at such contract
  market; and
  `(ii) other remedies under subsection (b) are more appropriate.
  `(2) EXCEPTIONS- A Commission order suspending dual trading may provide for
  exceptions to ensure fairness and orderly trading in such contract market
  (including, where appropriate, a reasonable phase-in period, a limitation
  of the suspension to specified contracts, exceptions for certain spread
  transactions, corrections of trading errors, or allowing a customer to
  designate in writing not less than once annually a named floor broker to
  execute orders for such customer).
  `(3) DURATION- Such suspension shall remain in effect until the Commission
  makes the finding required under paragraph (1). The Commission shall act
  expeditiously to consider making such finding upon any demonstration by
  the contract market under paragraph (1).
  `(d) RESCISSION, MODIFICATION, OR DELAY OF ORDERS- Before any proposed
  deficiency order issued by the Commission under subsection (b) may become
  final, the Commission shall--
  `(1) provide the affected contract market with an opportunity for a
  hearing through submission of written data, views, or arguments and,
  under terms set by the Commission at the request of the contract market,
  through an oral presentation of views and comments to the Commission, in
  order to petition the Commission to rescind, modify, or delay such order; and
  `(2) rule on such petition, not less than 20 days before the order takes
  effect, making findings, as appropriate, as to whether--
  `(A) the deficiencies cited by the Commission have been corrected or are
  being corrected under an expeditious timetable acceptable to the Commission;
  `(B) the trade monitoring system of the contract market is deficient as
  noted in the deficiency order; or
  `(C) the timetable proposed by the Commission in its proposed order for
  corrective action by the contract market, and the particular corrective
  action proposed, is appropriate in light of the deficiencies noted and
  the purposes of this Act.
  `(e) PENALTIES- Violation of a final deficiency order issued under subsection
  (d) shall be considered a violation of an order of the Commission for
  purposes of--
  `(1) establishing liability and assess penalties against a contract market
  or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof under section 6b; or
  `(2) initiating proceedings under section 5b or 6(a).
  `(f) JUDICIAL REVIEW-

  order issued under sub- section (b)(4), may obtain review of such order
  when issued by the Commission under the terms and conditions in section 6(b).

  to rescind, modify, or delay any proposed order issued under subsection (b)
  may obtain judicial review of any final such order only in the United States
  Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the party seeking review resides
  or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of
  Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, under the standards applicable
  to rulemaking proceedings under section 553 of title 5, United States Code.
  `(g) REPORTS-
  `(1) REPORTS ON ORDERS- Within 3 days of the issuance of any proposed or
  final order under this section or a finding under subsection (c)(1) with
  respect to dual trading, the Commission shall report to the Committee on

  Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate on such order or finding, including

  `(i) expertise in futures trading, or the regulation thereof, or in
  commodities traded through contracts on the exchange; or
  `(ii) other eminent qualifications making such person capable of
  participating in and contributing to board deliberations.
  `(C) provide that no less than 10 percent of the members of such board be
  comprised where applicable of farmers, producers, merchants, or exporters

  or preference for any person in the conduct of disciplinary proceedings
  and the assessment of penalties.
  `(B) A major disciplinary committee hearing a disciplinary matter shall
  include--
  `(i) qualified persons representing segments of the exchange membership
  other than that of the subject of the proceeding; and
  `(ii) where appropriate to carry out the purposes of this paragraph,
  qualified persons who are not members of the exchange.
  `(C) If a contract market takes final disciplinary action against a member
  for a violation that involves the execution of a customer transaction
  and results in financial harm to such customer, the contract market shall
  promptly inform the futures commission merchant identified on the records
  of such contract market as having cleared such transaction, and such
  futures commission merchant shall promptly inform the person identified
  on its records as the owner of the account for which such transaction was
  executed, of the disciplinary action and the principal facts thereof;
  `(16)(A) provide for the avoidance of conflict of interest in all
  deliberations by the governing board and any disciplinary and oversight
  committees.
  `(B) In order to comply with subparagraph (A), each contract market shall
  adopt rules and procedures to require, at a minimum, that any member of
  a governing board or a disciplinary or oversight committee must abstain
  from participation in confidential deliberations and voting on any matter
  where the named party in interest is the member, the member's employer,
  the member's employee, or any other person that has a business or employment
  relationship with the member that warrants abstention by such member.
  `(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, in considering
  whether the contract market should take any significant action that would
  not be submitted to the Commission for its prior approval, including the
  adoption of any nonphysical emergency rule (but excluding any rule not
  submitted for prior Commission approval because such rule is unrelated
  to terms and conditions of any contract traded on such contract market),
  the contract market shall adopt appropriate rules and regulations to
  ensure that--
  `(i) any party with access to material, nonpublic information about such
  deliberations gained through the position of the party as an exchange
  employee or official shall be prevented from--
  `(I) trading, directly or indirectly, in a manner to take improper advantage
  of such information; or
  `(II) transmitting such information to any other party, except as necessary
  for the performance of official duties; and
  `(ii) prior to such deliberations, the governing board or disciplinary
  or oversight committee, acting directly or through an authorized member
  or contract market official, shall (after review of the positions of the
  members of such board or committee, and positions at the firms with which
  such members are affiliated, including customer positions, in the futures
  or option contract that is the subject of the matter before the board
  or committee) consider whether any member of the board or committee must
  abstain from participating in the matter before the board or committee due to
  positions of such member, or positions, including customer positions, held
  at any firm with which such member is affiliated, in the futures or option
  contract that is the subject of the matter before the board or committee.
  `(D) If any board or committee considers whether to direct any member to
  abstain from participation in any matter before the board or committee,
  the minutes of such deliberations shall clearly reflect this fact; and
  `(17) provide that no member found by the Commission, a contract market,
  a registered futures association, or a court of competent jurisdiction to
  have committed any violation of this Act or any other provision of law that
  would reflect on the fitness of the member may serve on any contract market
  oversight or disciplinary panel for an appropriate period (as defined by
  Commission rule).'.

  and provides that no less than 20 percent of the members of such board be
  comprised of qualified nonmembers of or persons who are not regulated by
  such association.
  `(12)(A) such association provides on all major disciplinary committees
  for a diversity of membership sufficient to ensure fairness and to prevent
  special treatment or preference for any person in the conduct of disciplinary
  proceedings and the assessment of penalties.

  include--
  `(i) qualified persons representing segments of the association membership
  other than that of the subject of the proceeding; and

  qualified persons who are not members of the association.'.

  persons who are not members of the exchange or association, which shall
  include at a minimum--
  (A) any disciplinary action where the subject of such action is a member
  of the contract market or association governing board or of any major
  disciplinary committee of such contract market or association; and
  (B) any disciplinary action based on facts related to a claim that the
  subject of such action manipulated or attempted to manipulate the price
  of a commodity or future or option;

  merchant, as the Commission, by rule or regulation, may determine will
  effectuate the purposes of this subsection.
  `(ii) The term `Federal banking agency' shall have the same meaning as the
  term `appropriate Federal banking agency' in section 3(q) of the Federal
  Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(q)).
  `(2)(A) Each registered futures commission merchant shall obtain such
  information and make and keep such records as the Commission, by rule
  or regulation, prescribes concerning the registered futures commission
  merchant's policies, procedures, or systems for monitoring and controlling
  financial and operational risks to it resulting from the activities of
  any of its affiliated persons, other than a natural person.
  `(B) The records required under subparagraph (A) shall describe, in the
  aggregate, each of the futures and other financial activities conducted
  by, and the customary sources of capital and funding of, those of its
  affiliated persons whose business activities are reasonably likely to have
  a material impact on the financial or operational condition of the futures
  commission merchant, including its adjusted net capital, its liquidity,
  or its ability to conduct or finance its operations.
  `(C) The Commission, by rule or regulation, may require summary reports
  of such information to be filed by the futures commission merchant with
  the Commission no more frequently than quarterly.
  `(3)(A) If, as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports
  provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) or other available
  information, the Commission reasonably concludes that the Commission
  has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of any
  registered futures commission merchant, the Commission may require the
  futures commission merchant to make reports concerning the futures and
  other financial activities of any of such person's affiliated persons,
  other than a natural person, whose business activities are reasonably
  likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition
  of the futures commission merchant.
  `(B) The Commission, in requiring reports pursuant to this paragraph, shall
  specify the information required, the period for which it is required, the
  time and date on which the information must be furnished, and whether the
  information is to be furnished directly to the Commission or to a contract
  market or other self-regulatory organization with primary responsibility
  for examining the registered futures commission merchant's financial and
  operational condition.
  `(4)(A) In developing and implementing reporting requirements pursuant to
  paragraph (2) with respect to affiliated persons subject to examination
  by or reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission
  shall consult with and consider the views of each such Federal banking
  agency. If a Federal banking agency comments in writing on a proposed
  rule of the Commission under this subsection that has been published for
  comment, the Commission shall respond in writing to the written comment
  before adopting the proposed rule. The Commission shall, at the request
  of the Federal banking agency, publish the comment and response in the
  Federal Register at the time of publishing the adopted rule.
  `(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), a registered futures
  commission merchant shall be considered to have complied with a
  recordkeeping or reporting requirement adopted pursuant to paragraph
  (2) concerning an affiliated person that is subject to examination by,
  or reporting requirements of, a Federal banking agency if the futures
  commission merchant utilizes for the recordkeeping or reporting requirement
  copies of reports filed by the affiliated person with the Federal banking
  agency pursuant to section 5211 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 161),

  `(ii) The Commission may, by rule adopted pursuant to paragraph (2),
  require any futures commission merchant filing the reports with the
  Commission to obtain, maintain, or report supplemental information if the
  Commission makes an explicit finding that the supplemental information is
  necessary to inform the Commission regarding potential risks to the futures
  commission merchant. Prior to requiring any such supplemental information,
  the Commission shall first request the Federal banking agency to expand
  its reporting requirements to include the information.
  `(5) Prior to making a request pursuant to paragraph (3) for information
  with respect to an affiliated person that is subject to examination by or
  reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall--
  `(A) notify the agency of the information required with respect to the
  affiliated person; and
  `(B) consult with the agency to determine whether the information
  required is available from the agency and for other purposes, unless the
  Commission determines that any delay resulting from the consultation would
  be inconsistent with ensuring the financial and operational condition
  of the futures commission merchant or the stability or integrity of the
  futures markets.
  `(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the Commission
  to require any futures commission merchant to obtain, maintain, or furnish
  any examination report of any Federal banking agency or any supervisory
  recommendations or analysis contained in the report.
  `(7) No information provided to or obtained by the Commission from
  any Federal banking agency pursuant to a request under paragraph (5)
