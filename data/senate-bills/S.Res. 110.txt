                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate condemning the bombing in Oklahoma 
                                 City.

Whereas, on Wednesday, April 19, 1995, a car bomb exploded outside the Alfred P. 
        Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, collapsing the north 
        face of this nine-story concrete building, killing and injuring innocent 
        and defenseless children and adults;
Whereas authorities are calling this the deadliest terrorist attack ever on U.S. 
        soil;
Whereas Federal law authorizes the imposition of the death penalty for terrorist 
        murder; and
Whereas additional anti-terrorism measures are now pending for consideration in 
        the United States Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate of the United States--
            (1) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous 
        bombing attack against innocent children and adults at the 
        Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City;
            (2) sends its heartfelt condolences to the families, 
        friends, and loved ones of those whose lives were taken away by 
        this abhorrent and cowardly act; and expresses its hopes for 
        the rapid and complete recovery of those wounded in the 
        bombing;
            (3) applauds all those courageous rescue and volunteer 
        workers who are giving unselfishly of themselves and commends 
        all law enforcement officials who are working determinedly to 
        bring the perpetrators to justice;
            (4) supports the President's and the United States Attorney 
        General's position that Federal prosecutors will seek the 
        maximum penalty allowed by law, including the death penalty, 
        for those responsible;
            (5) commends the rapid actions taken by the President to 
        provide assistance to victims of the explosion and for promptly 
        beginning an investigation to find the perpetrators of this 
        crime, and it urges the President to use all necessary means to 
        continue this effort until the perpetrators and their 
        accomplices are found and appropriately punished; and
            (6) will expeditiously approve legislation to strengthen 
        the authority and resources of all federal agencies involved in 
        combating such acts of terrorism.
