RESOLUTION
Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding loan guarantees for refugee
resettlement in Israel.
Whereas the United States has a long-standing policy of supporting free
emigration for people living in the former Soviet Union;
Whereas since 1974 the United States has linked nondiscriminatory trade
treatment (most favored nation status) for the former Soviet Union to free
emigration through the Jackson-Vanik amendment;
Whereas anti-Semitism continues to be a threat to Jews in the former Soviet
Union;
Whereas Israel faces an untenable burden in absorbing unprecedented numbers
of Soviet refugees;
Whereas the success of United States policy on human rights regarding the
former Soviet Union and Ethiopia has resulted in approximately 400,000
refugees to Israel since 1989;
Whereas the General Accounting Office found that `Israel appears to have
a reasonable basis for estimating that about one million Soviet immigrants
will arrive during the current immigration wave, which began in late 1989';
Whereas the General Accounting Office found that `if the Congress authorizes
the $10,000,000,000 in loan guarantees requested by the Israeli Government,
the Israeli Government will likely be able to fully service its external
debt and to continue its past record of payment'; and
Whereas the Government of Israel has agreed to pay origination fees for loan
guarantees so that the guarantees will not result in any cost to the United
States taxpayer: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the United States
  Government should support appropriate loan guarantees to Israel for
  refugee absorption.
