SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other 
        advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical 
        progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness will 
        allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms 
        have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps 
        to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a particular 
        disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow for the 
        development of better therapies that are more effective against 
        disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments. 
        These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic 
        information to discriminate in health insurance and employment.
            (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State 
        laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having 
        presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental retardation, mental 
        disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other 
        conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the 
        State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted 
        sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent genetic traits or 
        tendencies. Many of these State laws have since been repealed, 
        and many have been modified to include essential constitutional 
        requirements of due process and equal protection. However, the 
        current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history 
        of sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic 
        science, compels Congressional action in this area.
            (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many 
        genetic conditions and disorders are associated with particular 
        racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic 
        traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a 
        particular group may be stigmatized or discriminated against as 
        a result of that genetic information. This form of 
        discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw the advent 
        of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell 
        anemia, a disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, 
        State legislatures began to enact discriminatory laws in the 
        area, and in the early 1970s began mandating genetic screening 
        of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to 
        discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this 
        stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia 
        Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States unless 
        sickle cell testing is voluntary.
            (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic 
        discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of pre-
        employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, 
        which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that 
        case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 
        1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling 
        public interest in relieving the fear of discrimination and in 
        prohibiting its actual practice in employment and health 
        insurance.
            (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health 
        insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and 
        depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have 
        enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws 
        vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and 
        level of protection. Congress has collected substantial 
        evidence that the American public and the medical community 
        find the existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be 
        confusing and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. 
        Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and 
        uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public 
        from discrimination and allay their concerns about the 
        potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to 
        take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, and 
        new therapies.

        the changes made by this section, the State regulatory program 
        shall not be considered to be out of compliance with the 
        requirements of section 1882 of the Social Security Act due 
        solely to failure to make such change until the date specified 
        in paragraph (4).

        National Association of Insurance Commissioners (in this 
        subsection referred to as the ``NAIC'') modifies its NAIC Model

                date specified in this paragraph for a State is the 
                earlier of--

                        or regulations to conform its regulatory 
                        program to the changes made by this section, or

                case of a State which the Secretary identifies as--

                        legislation appropriating funds) to conform its 
                        regulatory program to the changes made in this 
                        section, but
                            (ii) having a legislature which is not 
                        scheduled to meet in 2006 in a legislative 
                        session in which such legislation may be 
                        considered, the date specified in this 
                        paragraph is the first day of the first

                        the case of a State that has a 2-year 
                        legislative session, each year of such session 
                        shall be deemed to be a separate regular 
                        session of the State legislature.
