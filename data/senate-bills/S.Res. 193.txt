Whereas the United States and a broad international coalition have been engaged in a Global War on Terrorism since the terrorist attacks in Washington, D.C., New York, and Pennsylvania that occurred on September 11, 2001;
Whereas the people and Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom enjoy a deep and enduring friendship undergirded by shared history, language, and values;
Whereas the United Kingdom has been a strong and steadfast ally to the United States through two World Wars, the Cold War, the Gulf War, and the Global War on Terrorism, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;
Whereas terrorists have planned and conducted attacks around the world during the four years after the Global War on Terrorism began in 2001, most notably the bombing of a night club on the Indonesian island of Bali on October 12, 2002 that killed 202 people and injured an additional 209, the bombings of two synagogues and the British Embassy in Istanbul, Turkey in November 2003, in which 56 people were killed and over 450 injured, and the bombing of the train system in Madrid, Spain on March 11, 2004 that killed more than 190 people and injured approximately 1,500;
Whereas on July 7, 2005, a series of four explosions struck the London public transportation system during the morning rush hour, killing at least 49 innocent civilians and injuring approximately 700 others;
Whereas a previously unknown terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of al Qaeda;
Whereas the terrorist attacks in London coincided with the opening of the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, a Summit committed to bringing help and hope to the poorest countries of the world;
Whereas President Bush immediately condemned the terrorist attacks and extended the “heartfelt condolences” of the people of the United States to the people of the United Kingdom;
Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed, on behalf of the United Kingdom and the world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, to remain steadfast and strong in the fight against terrorism, stating, “All of our countries have suffered from the impact of terrorism. Those responsible have no respect for human life. We are united in our resolve to confront and defeat this terrorism that is not an attack on one nation, but all nations and on civilized people everywhere. . . . It's important . . . that those engaged in terrorism realize that our determination to defend our values and our way of life is greater than their determination to cause death and destruction to innocent people in a desire to impose extremism on the world”, and declared, “We shall prevail, and [the terrorists] shall not”;
Whereas the North Atlantic Council, the governing body of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, after meeting in an extraordinary session, reaffirmed the determination of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to combat the scourge of terrorism and defend the values of freedom, tolerance, and democracy using all available means;
Whereas world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland expressed condolences to the people of the United Kingdom and issued a joint statement to “condemn utterly these barbaric attacks”; and
Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on behalf of the world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, declared, “We are united in the resolve” to defeat terrorism, which is “not an attack on one nation, but on all nations”: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
