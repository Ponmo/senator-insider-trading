                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 24, 1999

 Mr. Lott (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. 
  Frist) submitted the following resolution; which was ordered to be 
                         placed on the calendar

                           September 27, 1999

                        Considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding reauthorizing the 
            Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.

Whereas the fiscal year 2000 Senate Budget Resolution increased 
        education funding by $28,000,000,000 over the next five years, 
        and $82,000,000,000 over the next ten years, and the Department 
        of Education received a net increase of $2,400,000,000 which 
        doubles the President's requested increase;
Whereas compared to the President's requested levels, the 
        Democratically controlled Congress' appropriations for the 
        period 1993 through 1995 reduced the President's funding 
        requests by $3,000,000,000, and since Republicans took control 
        of Congress, Federal education funding has increased by 27 
        percent;
Whereas in the past three years, the Congress has increased funding for 
        Part B of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by nearly 
        80 percent, while the Administration's fiscal year 2000 budget 
        only requested a 0.07 percent increase which is less than an 
        adjustment for inflation, and Congress is deeply concerned that 
        while the Administration has provided rhetoric in support of 
        education of the disabled, the Administration's budget has 
        consistently taken money from this high priority program to 
        fund new and untested programs;
Whereas Congress is not only providing the necessary funds, but is also 
        reforming our current education programs, and Congress 
        recognizes that significant reforms are needed in light of 
        troubling statistics indicating--
            (1) 40 percent of fourth graders cannot read at the most 
        basic level;
            (2) in international comparisons, United States 12th 
        graders scored near the bottom in both mathematics and science;
            (3) 70 percent of children in high poverty schools score 
        below even the most basic level of reading; and
            (4) in mathematics, 9 year olds in high poverty schools 
        remain two grade levels behind students in low poverty schools;
Whereas earlier in 1999, the 106th Congress took the first step toward 
        improving our Nation's schools by passing the Education 
        Flexibility and Partnership Act of 1999, which frees States and 
        local communities to tailor education programs to meet the 
        individual needs of students and local schools;
Whereas the 1999 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary 
        Education Act of 1965 will focus on increasing student 
        achievement by empowering principals, local school boards, 
        teachers and parents, and the focus should be on raising the 
        achievement of all students;
Whereas Congress should reject a one-size-fits all approach to 
        education, and local schools should have the freedom to 
        prioritize their spending and tailor their curriculum according 
        to the unique educational needs of their children;
Whereas parents are the first and best educators of their children, and 
        Congress supports proposals that provide parents greater 
        control to choose unique educational opportunities to best meet 
        their children's educational needs;
Whereas every child should have an exceptional teacher in the 
        classroom, and Congress supports efforts to recruit, retrain, 
        and retain high quality teachers;
Whereas quality instruction and learning can occur only in a first 
        class school that is safe and orderly;
Whereas Congress supports proposals that give schools the support they 
        need to protect teachers and students, remove disruptive 
        influences, and create a positive learning atmosphere; and
Whereas success in education is best achieved when instruction focuses 
        on basic academics and fundamental skills, and students should 
        no longer be subjected to untried and untested educational 
        theories of instruction, rather our Nation's efforts should be 
        geared to proven methods of instruction: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) this Congress has taken strong steps to reform our 
        Nation's educational system and allowed States, local schools 
        and parents more flexibility and authority over their 
        children's education; and
            (2) the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary 
        Education Act of 1965 will enable this Congress to continue its 
        efforts to send decision making back to States, local schools, 
        and families.
