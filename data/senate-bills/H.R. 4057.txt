        General shall conduct an assessment that includes the 
        following:
                    (A)(i) Validation of Federal Aviation

                the reliability of Federal Aviation Administration 
                source documents and the integrity and reliability of 
                the Federal Aviation Administration's data collection 
                process.
                    (ii) An assessment of the reliability of the

                establishing asset values and depreciation rates.
                    (iv) An assessment of the Federal Aviation 
                Administration's system of internal controls for 
                ensuring the consistency and reliability of reported 
                data to begin immediately after full operational 
                capability of the cost accounting system.
                    (B) A review and validation of the Federal Aviation 
                Administration's definition of the services to which 
                the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately 
                attributes its costs, and the methods used to identify 
                direct costs associated with the services.
                    (C) An assessment and validation of the general 
                cost pools used by the Federal Aviation Administration, 
                including the rationale for and reliability of the 
                bases on which the Federal Aviation Administration 
                proposes to allocate costs of services to users and the 
                integrity of the cost pools as well as any other 
                factors considered important by the Inspector General. 
                Appropriate statistical tests shall be performed to 
                assess relationships between costs in the various cost 
                pools and activities and services to which the costs 
                are attributed by the Federal Aviation Administration.
    (b) Deadline.--The independent analyses described in this section 
shall be completed no later than 270 days after the contracts are 
awarded to the outside independent contractors. The Inspector General 
shall submit a final report combining the analyses done by its staff

SEC. 522. TOURISM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) through an effective public-private partnership, 
        Federal, State, and local governments and the travel and 
        tourism industry can successfully market the United States as 
        the premiere international tourist destination in the world;
            (2) in 1997, the travel and tourism industry made a 
        substantial contribution to the health of the Nation's economy, 
        as follows:
                    (A) The industry is one of the Nation's largest 
                employers, directly employing 7,000,000 Americans, 
                throughout every region of the country, heavily 
                concentrated among small businesses, and indirectly 
                employing an additional 9,200,000 Americans, for a 
                total of 16,200,000 jobs.
                    (B) The industry ranks as the first, second, or 
                third largest employer in 32 States and the District of 
                Columbia, generating a total tourism-related annual 
                payroll of $127,900,000,000.
                    (C) The industry has become the Nation's third-
                largest retail sales industry, generating a total of 
                $489,000,000,000 in total expenditures.
                    (D) The industry generated $71,700,000,000 in tax 
                revenues for Federal, State, and local governments;
            (3) the more than $98,000,000,000 spent by foreign visitors 
        in the United States in 1997 generated a trade services surplus 
        of more than $26,000,000,000;
            (4) the private sector, States, and cities currently spend 
        more than $1,000,000,000 annually to promote particular 
        destinations within the United States to international 
        visitors;
            (5) because other nations are spending hundreds of millions 
        of dollars annually to promote the visits of international 
        tourists to their countries, the United States will miss a 
        major marketing opportunity if it fails to aggressively compete 
        for an increased share of international tourism expenditures as 
        they continue to increase over the next decade;
            (6) a well-funded, well-coordinated international marketing 
        effort--combined with additional public and private sector 
        efforts--would help small and large businesses, as well as 
        State and local governments, share in the anticipated 
        phenomenal growth of the international travel and tourism 
        market in the 21st century;
            (7) by making permanent the successful visa waiver pilot 
        program, Congress can facilitate the increased flow of 
        international visitors to the United States;
            (8) Congress can increase the opportunities for attracting 
        international visitors and enhancing their stay in the United 
        States by--
                    (A) improving international signage at airports, 
                seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, 
                train, and other public transit stations in the United 
                States;
                    (B) increasing the availability of multilingual 
                tourist information; and
                    (C) creating a toll-free, private-sector operated, 
                telephone number, staffed by multilingual operators, to 
                provide assistance to international tourists coping 
                with an emergency;
            (9) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for 
        travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide 
        Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that 
        would help policymakers more accurately gauge the size and 
        scope of the domestic travel and tourism industry and its 
        significant impact on the health of the Nation's economy; and
            (10) having established the United States National Tourism 
        Organization under the United States National Tourism 
        Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase 
        the United States share of the international tourism market by 
        developing a national travel and tourism strategy, Congress 
        should support a long-term marketing effort and other important 
        regulatory reform initiatives to promote increased travel to 
        the United States for the benefit of every sector of the 
        economy.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide 
international visitor initiatives and an international marketing 
program to enable the United States travel and tourism industry and 
every level of government to benefit from a successful effort to make 
the United States the premiere travel destination in the world.
    (c) International Visitor Assistance Task Force.--
            (1) Establishment.--Not later than 9 months after the date 
        of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall 
        establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International

        the ``Task Force'').
            (2) Duties.--The Task Force shall examine--
                    (A) signage at facilities in the United States, 
                including airports, seaports, land border crossings, 
                highways, and bus, train, and other public transit 
                stations, and shall identify existing inadequacies and 
                suggest solutions for such inadequacies, such as the 
                adoption of uniform standards on international signage 
                for use throughout the United States in order to 
                facilitate international visitors' travel in the United 
                States;
                    (B) the availability of multilingual travel and 
                tourism information and means of disseminating, at no 
                or minimal cost to the Government, of such information; 
                and
                    (C) facilitating the establishment of a toll-free, 
                private-sector operated, telephone number, staffed by 
                multilingual operators, to provide assistance to 
                international tourists coping with an emergency.

                Force by the Chairman.
            (4) Chairman.--The Secretary of Commerce shall be Chairman 
        of the Task Force. The Task Force shall meet at least twice

            (5) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the

        of the review, including proposed amendments to existing laws 
        or regulations as may be appropriate to implement such 
        recommendations.
    (d) Travel and Tourism Industry Satellite System of Accounting.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Commerce shall complete, 
        as soon as may be practicable, a satellite system of accounting 
        for the travel and tourism industry.

        airline.
    (b) Study.--The Secretary of Transportation, after consulting the

        the Charlotte-London (Gatwick) route;
            (2) the Secretary awarded the Charlotte-London (Gatwick) 
        route to US Airways on September 12, 1997, and on May 7, 1998, 
        US Airways announced plans to launch nonstop service in 
        competition with the monopoly held by British Airways on the 
        route and to provide convenient single-carrier one-stop service 
        to the United Kingdom from dozens of cities in North Carolina 
        and South Carolina and the surrounding region;

        Airport;
            (4) British Airways continues to operate monopoly service 
        on the Charlotte-London (Gatwick) route and recently upgraded 
        the aircraft for that route to B-777 aircraft;
            (5) British Airways had been awarded an additional monopoly 
        route between London England and Denver, Colorado, resulting in 
        a total of 10 monopoly routes operated by British Airways 
        between the United Kingdom and points in the United States;
            (6) monopoly service results in higher fares to passengers;

        the United Kingdom provides commercially viable access to the 
        Gatwick Airport.
    (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Secretary should--
            (1) act vigorously to ensure the enforcement of the rights 
        of the United States under the Bermuda II Agreement;

        competitive service for the Charlotte-London (Gatwick) route;

            (3) ensure that the rights of the Government of the United 
        States and citizens and air carriers of the United States are 
        enforced under the Bermuda II Agreement before seeking to 
        renegotiate a broader bilateral agreement to establish 
        additional rights for air carriers of the United States and 
        foreign air carriers of the United Kingdom.

                 TITLE VII--NATIONAL PARKS OVERFLIGHTS

SEC. 701. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Federal Aviation Administration has sole authority 
        to control airspace over the United States;
            (2) the Federal Aviation Administration has the authority 
        to preserve, protect, and enhance the environment by 
        minimizing, mitigating, or preventing the adverse effects of 
        aircraft overflights on the public and tribal lands;
            (3) the National Park Service has the responsibility of 
        conserving the scenery and natural and historic objects and 
        wildlife in national parks and of providing for the enjoyment 
        of the national parks in ways that leave the national parks 
        unimpaired for future generations;
            (4) the protection of tribal lands from aircraft 
        overflights is consistent with protecting the public health and 
        welfare and is essential to the maintenance of the natural and 
        cultural resources of Indian tribes;
            (5) the National Parks Overflights Working Group, composed 
        of general aviation, air tour, environmental, and Native 
        American representatives, recommended that the Congress enact 
        legislation based on its consensus work product; and
            (6) this title reflects the recommendations made by that 
        Group.

                    ``(A) In general.--The Administrator shall, in 
                cooperation with the Director, establish an air tour 
                management plan for any national park or tribal land 
                for which such a plan is not already in effect whenever 
                a person applies for authority to operate a commercial 
                air tour over the park. The development of the air tour 
                management plan is to be a cooperative undertaking 
                between the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
                National Park Service. The air tour management plan 
                shall be developed by means of a public process, and 
                the agencies shall develop information and analysis 
                that explains the conclusions that the agencies make in 
                the application of the respective criteria. Such 
                explanations shall be included in the Record of 
                Decision and may be subject to judicial review.

                significant adverse impacts, if any, of commercial air 
                tours upon the natural and cultural resources and 
                visitor experiences and tribal lands.

        Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) which may include a finding 
        of no significant impact, an environmental assessment, or an 
        environmental impact statement, and the Record of Decision for 
        the air tour management plan.

    (b) Limitation on Expenditure Authority.--Section 9502 of such Code

    ``(f) Limitation on Transfers to Trust Fund.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), no

                    ``(B) whether such provision of law is a 
                subsequently enacted provision or directly or 
                indirectly seeks to waive the application of this 
                subsection.
            ``(2) Exception for prior obligations.--Paragraph (1) shall 
        not apply to any expenditure to liquidate any contract entered
