``SEC. 21152. ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CARRIERS.

    ``(a) Refund of Premiums.--If an application for a long-term care 
policy (or for a certificate under a group long-term care policy) is 
denied or an applicant returns a policy or certificate within 30 days 
of the date of its issuance pursuant to subsection 21156, the carrier 
shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the denial or return, 
refund directly to the applicant, or in the case of an employer to 
whomever remits the premium, any premiums paid with respect to such a 
policy (or certificate). Any such refund shall not be made by delivery 
by the carrier.
    ``(b) Mailing of Policy.--If an application for a long-term care 
policy (or for a certificate under a group long-term care policy) is 
approved, the carrier shall provide each individual applicant the 
policy (or certificate) of insurance and outline of coverage not later 
than 30 days after the date of the approval.
    ``(c) Information on Denials of Claims.--If a claim under a long-
term care policy is denied, the carrier shall, within 15 days of the 
date of a written request by the policyholder or certificate holder (or 
representative)--
            ``(1) provide a written explanation of the reasons for the 
        denial;
            ``(2) make available all medical and patient records 
        directly relating to such denial; and
            ``(3) provide a written explanation of the manner in which 
        to appeal the denial.
Except as provided in subsection (e) of section 21154, no claim under 
such a policy may be denied on the basis of a failure to disclose a 
condition at the time of issuance of the policy if the application for 
the policy failed to request information respecting the condition.
    ``(d) Reporting of Information.--A carrier that issues one or more 
long-term care policies shall periodically (not less often than 
annually) report, in a form and in a manner specified by the reform 
standards, to the appropriate certifying authority for the State in 
which the policy is delivered, and shall make available to the 
Secretary, upon request, information in a form and manner so specified 
concerning--
            ``(1) the long-term care policies of the carrier that are 
        in force;
            ``(2) the most recent premiums for such policies and the 
        premiums imposed for such policies since the initial issuance 
        of such policies;
            ``(3) the lapse rate, replacement rate, and rescission 
        rates by policy; and
            ``(4) the claims denied (expressed as a number and as a 
        percentage of claims submitted) by policy.
For purposes of paragraph (3), there shall be included (but reported 
separately) data concerning lapses due to the death of the 
policyholder. For purposes of paragraph (4), there shall not be 
included as a claim any claim that is denied solely because of the 
failure to meet a deductible, waiting period, or exclusionary period.
    ``(e) Standards on Compensation for Sale of Policies.--
            ``(1) In general.--Until the Secretary, in consultation 
        with the NAIC, promulgates mandatory standards concerning 
        compensation for the sale of long-term care policies, a carrier 
        that issues one or more long-term care policies may provide a 
        commission or other compensation to an agent or other 
        representative for the sale of such a policy only if the first 
        year commission or other first year compensation to be paid 
        does not exceed the greater of--
                    ``(A) 200 percent of the commission or other 
                compensation paid for selling or servicing the policy 
                in the second year, or
                    ``(B) 50 percent of the premium paid on the first 
                year policy.
            ``(2) Subsequent years.--The commission or other 
        compensation provided for the sale of long-term care policies 
        to an individual during each of the years during the 5-year 
        period subsequent to the first year of the policy shall be the 
        same as that provided in the second subsequent year.
            ``(3) Limitation.--No carrier shall provide compensation to 
        its agents for the sale of a long-term care policy which 
        replaces an existing policy, and no agent shall receive 
        compensation for such sale greater than the renewal 
        compensation payable by the replacing carrier on renewal 
        policies.
            ``(4) Compensation defined.--As used in this subsection, 
        the term `compensation' includes pecuniary or nonpecuniary 
        remuneration of any kind relating to the sale or renewal of the 
        policy, including, but not limited to, deferred compensation, 
        bonuses, gifts, prizes, awards, and finders' fees.

``SEC. 21153. RENEWAL STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE, AND BASIS FOR 
              CANCELLATION OF POLICIES.

    ``(a) In General.--No long-term care policy may be canceled or 
nonrenewed for any reason other than nonpayment of premium, material 
misrepresentation, or fraud.
    ``(b) Continuation and Conversion Rights for Group Policies.--
            ``(1) In general.--Each group long-term care policy shall 
        provide covered individuals with a basis for continuation or 
        conversion in accordance with this subsection.
            ``(2) Basis for continuation.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (1), a policy provides a basis for continuation of coverage if 
        the policy maintains coverage under the existing group policy 
        when such coverage would otherwise terminate and which is 
        subject only to the continued timely payment of premiums when 
        due. A group policy which restricts provision of benefits and 
        services to, or contains incentives to use certain providers or 
        facility, may provide continuation benefits which are 
        substantially equivalent to the benefits of the existing group 
        policy.
            ``(3) Basis for conversion.--For purposes of paragraph (1), 
        a policy provides a basis for conversion of coverage if the 
        policy entitles each individual--
                    ``(A) whose coverage under the group policy would 
                otherwise be terminated for any reason; and
                    ``(B) who has been continuously insured under the 
                policy (or group policy which was replaced) for at 
                least 6 months before the date of the termination;
        to issuance of a policy providing benefits not less than, 
        substantially equivalent to, or in excess of, those of the 
        policy being terminated, without evidence of insurability.
            ``(4) Treatment of substantial equivalence.--In determining 
        under this subsection whether benefits are substantially 
        equivalent, consideration should be given to the difference 
        between managed care and non-managed care plans.
            ``(5) Group replacement of policies.--If a group long-term 
        care policy is replaced by another long-term care policy 
        purchased by the same policyholder, the succeeding issuer shall 
        offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group 
        policy on its date of termination. Coverage under the new group 
        policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting 
        conditions that would have been covered under the group policy 
        being replaced.
    ``(c) Standards for Issuance.--
            ``(1) In general.--
                    ``(A) Guarantee.--A carrier that sells or issues 
                long-term care policies shall guarantee that such 
                policies shall be sold or issued to an individual, or 
                eligible individual in the case of a group plan, if 
                such individual meets the minimum medical underwriting 
                requirements of such policy.
                    ``(B) Premium for converted policy.--If the group 
                policy from which conversion is made replaced previous 
                group coverage, the premium for the converted policy 
                shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age 
                at inception of coverage under the group policy.
            ``(2) Upgrade for current policies.--The reform standards 
        shall specify standards, including those providing guidance on 
        medical underwriting and age rating, with respect to the access 
        of individuals to policies offering upgraded benefits.
            ``(3) Rate stabilization.--The reform standards shall 
        specify standards for premium rate stabilization.
    ``(d) Effect of Incapacitation.--
            ``(1) In general.--
                    ``(A) Prohibition.--Except as provided in paragraph 
                (2), a long-term care policy in effect as of the 
                effective date of the reform standards may not be 
                canceled for nonpayment if the policy holder is 
                determined by a long-term care provider, physician or 
                other health care provider (independent of the issuer 
                of the policy), to be cognitively or mentally 
                incapacitated so as to not make payments in a timely 
                manner.
                    ``(B) Reinstatement.--A long-term care policy shall 
                include a provision that provides for the reinstatement 
                of such coverage, in the event of lapse, if the carrier 
                is provided with proof of cognitive or mental 
                incapacitation. Such reinstatement option shall remain 
                available for a period of not less than 5 months after 
                termination and shall allow for the collection of past 
                due premium.
            ``(2) Permitted cancellation.--A long-term care policy may 
        be canceled under paragraph (1) for nonpayment if--
                    ``(A) the period of such nonpayment is in excess of 
                30 days; and
                    ``(B) notice of intent to cancel is provided to the 
                policyholder or designated representative of the policy 
                holder not less than 30 days prior to such 
                cancellation, except that notice may not be provided 
                until the expiration of 30 days after a premium is due 
                and unpaid.
        Notice under this paragraph shall be deemed to have been given 
        as of 5 days after the mailing date.

``SEC. 21154. BENEFIT STANDARDS.

    ``(a) Use of Standard Definitions and Terminology, Uniform Format, 
and Standard Benefits.--Pursuant to the reform standards, each long-
term care policy shall, with respect to services, providers or

        such language and definitions may take into account the

        purchase a long-term care policy that provides for increases in 
        benefit levels, with benefit maximums or reasonable durations 
        that are meaningful, to account for reasonably anticipated 
        increases in the costs of long-term care services covered by 
        the policy. A carrier may not offer to a policyholder an 
        inflation protection feature that is less favorable to the

                evidence of insurability or health status so long as 
                the option for the previous period was not declined.

                or whether such individual delays purchasing such 
                protection until a future time.

        (1) that provides for automatic benefit increases shall include 
        an offer of a premium that the carrier expects to remain 
        constant. Such offer shall disclose in a conspicuous manner 
        that the premium may change in the future unless the premium is 
        guaranteed to remain constant.

        subsection shall be included in a long-term care policy unless 
        a carrier obtains a written rejection of such protection signed 
        by the policyholder.

shall provide that if the policy lapses after the policy has been in 
effect for a minimum period as specified under the reform standards, 
the policy will provide, without payment of any additional premiums, 
nonforfeiture benefits as determined appropriate by such standards.
    ``(b) Establishment of Standards.--The reform standards shall 
provide that the percentage or amount of benefits under subsection (a) 
shall increase based upon the policyholder's equity in the policy.

    ``(a) Contestability.--A carrier may not cancel or renew a long-
term care policy or deny a claim under the policy based on fraud or 
intentional misrepresentation relating to the issuance of the policy

time period to be determined by the reform standards.

shall have the right to return the policy (or certificates) within 30 
days of the date of its delivery (and to have the premium refunded) if, 
after examination of the policy or certificate, the applicant is not 
satisfied for any reason.

        the rural area through the use of telemedicine;
            ``(2) to provide for consultations involving transmissions 
        of detailed data about the patient that serves as a reasonable 
        substitute for face-to-face interaction between the patient and

            ``(3) to make outside resources or business interaction 
        more available to the rural area.

        telecommunications users in the area to take advantage of

conference, the facilitator shall, after identifying the necessary 
parties and confirming that the case is eligible for the Program, 
analyze the record of the claims procedure conducted pursuant to

determine if further case development is needed to clarify the legal 
and factual issues in dispute, and whether there is any need for 
additional information and documents.
    ``(c) Conference.--Upon convening the conference, the facilitator 
shall assist the parties in identifying undisputed issues and exploring 
settlement. If settlement is reached, the facilitator shall assist in 
the preparation of a written settlement agreement. If no settlement is

shall not apply to mediation proceedings under the Early Resolution 
Program. All statements made and evidence presented in the proceedings

parties to mediation proceedings under the Program shall not be 
required to make statements or present evidence under oath.

    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            ``(1) The improper disclosure of individually identifiable 
        health care information may cause significant harm to an 
        individual's interests in privacy, health care, and reputation 
        and may unfairly affect the ability of an individual to obtain 
        employment, education, insurance, and credit.
            ``(2) The movement of people and health care related 
        information across State lines, the availability of, access to, 
        and exchange of health care related information with Federally 
        funded health care systems, the medicare program under title 
        XVIII, and the medicaid program under title XIX, through 
        automated data banks and networks, and the emergence of other 
        multistate health care providers and payors create a need for a 
        uniform Federal law governing the disclosure of health care 
        information.
    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to establish 
effective mechanisms to protect the privacy of individuals with respect 
to individually identifiable health care information that is created or 
maintained as part of health treatment, enrollment, payment, testing, 
or research processes.

``SEC. 11802. DEFINITIONS.

                insurer, school or university, or certified health 
                information network service; and
                    ``(B) relates to the past, present, or future 
                physical or mental health or condition of an

                individual, or the past, present, or future payment for 
                the provision of health care to an individual, and--

                        reasonable basis to believe that the

                        individual.
            ``(2) Disclose.--The term `disclose', when used with 
        respect to protected health information, means to provide 
        access to the information, but only if such access is provided 
        to a person other than the individual who is the subject of the 
        information.

  ``PART C--STATE PROGRAMS FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES FOR 
                     INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES

``SEC. 1971. STATE PROGRAMS FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES FOR 
              INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES.

    ``(a) In General.--Each State that has a plan for home and 
community-based services for individuals with disabilities submitted to 
and approved by the Secretary under section 1972(b) is entitled to 
payment in accordance with section 1978.
    ``(b) Entitlement to Services.--Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to create a right to services for individuals or a 
requirement that a State with an approved plan expend the entire amount 
of funds to which it is entitled under this part.
    ``(c) Designation of Agency.--Not later than 6 months after the 
date of enactment of this part, the Secretary shall designate an agency 
responsible for program administration under this part.

``SEC. 1972. STATE PLANS.

    ``(a) Plan Requirements.--In order to be approved under subsection 
(b), a State plan for home and community-based services for individuals 
with disabilities must meet the following requirements:
            ``(1) Eligibility.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Within the amounts provided by 
                the State and under section 1978 for such plan, the 
                plan shall provide that services under the plan will be 
                available to individuals with disabilities (as defined 
                in section 1973(a)) in the State.
                    ``(B) Initial screening.--The plan shall provide a 
                process for the initial screening of an individual who 
                has some reasonable probability of being an individual 
                with disabilities. Any such process shall require the 
                provision of assistance to individuals who wish to 
                apply but whose disability limits their ability to 
                apply. The initial screening and the determination of 
                disability (as defined under section 1973(b)(1)) shall 
                be conducted by a public agency.
                    ``(C) Restrictions.--The plan may not limit the 
                eligibility of individuals with disabilities based on--
                            ``(i) income,
                            ``(ii) age,
                            ``(iii) geography,
                            ``(iv) nature or category of disability,
                            ``(v) residential setting (other than an 
                        institutional setting), or
                            ``(vi) other grounds specified by the 
                        Secretary;
                except that the Secretary may permit a State to limit 
                eligibility based on level of disability.
                    ``(D) Continuation of services.--The plan must 
                provide assurances that, in the case of an individual 
                receiving medical assistance for home and community-
                based services under the State medicaid plan as of the 
                date the first State plan is approved under this part, 
                the State will continue to make available (either under 
                this plan, under the State medicaid plan, or otherwise) 
                to such individual an appropriate level of assistance 
                for home and community-based services, taking into 
                account the level of assistance provided as of such 
                date and the individual's need for home and community-
                based services.
            ``(2) Services.--
                    ``(A) Needs assessment.--Not later than the end of 
                the second year of implementation, the plan or its 
                amendments shall include the results of a statewide 
                assessment of the needs of individuals with 
                disabilities in a format required by the Secretary. The 
                needs assessment shall include demographic data 
                concerning the number of individuals within each 
                category of disability described in this part, and the 
                services available to meet the needs of such 
                individuals.
                    ``(B) Specification.--Consistent with section 1974, 
                the plan shall specify--
                            ``(i) the services made available under the 
                        plan,
                            ``(ii) the extent and manner in which such 
                        services are allocated and made available to 
                        individuals with disabilities, and
                            ``(iii) the manner in which services under 
                        the plan are coordinated with each other and 
                        with health and long-term care services 
                        available outside the plan for individuals with 
                        disabilities.
                    ``(C) Taking into account informal care.--A State 
                plan may take into account, in determining the amount 
                and array of services made available to covered 
                individuals with disabilities, the availability of 
                informal care.

                        all categories of individuals with 
                        disabilities, regardless of their age or the 
                        nature of their disabling conditions,
                            ``(iv) shall demonstrate that services are

                        (A), and

                                disabilities who are provided home and 
                                community-based services either under 
                                the plan, under the State medicaid 
                                plan, or under both, is not less than,

                Secretary finds not to be necessary for the health and 
                safety of individuals with disabilities.
                    ``(F) Consumer choice.--To the extent feasible, the 
                State shall follow the choice of an individual with 
                disabilities (or that individual's designated 
                representative who may be a family member) regarding 
                which covered services to receive and the providers who

        be made by a public or nonprofit agency that is specified under 
        the State plan and that is not a provider of home and 
        community-based services under this part and by using a uniform 
        protocol consisting of an initial screening and a determination 
        of disability specified by the Secretary. A State may not 
        impose cost sharing with respect to a determination of 
        disability. A State may collect additional information, at the 
        time of obtaining information to make such determination, in

        considered to be effective under the State plan for a period of 
        not more than 6 months (or for such longer period in such cases 
        as a significant change in an individual's condition that may 
        affect such determination is unlikely). A reassessment shall be 
        made if there is a significant change in an individual's 
        condition that may affect such determination.

                        The Secretary may from time to time revise such 
                        index to the extent necessary to accurately 
                        measure increases or decreases in such costs.

                        1.5 percent plus the percentage by which the 
                        CPI for calendar year 1996 (as defined in

    ``(c) Treatment of Long-Term Care Insurance Policies.--For purposes 
of this title, any amount received or coverage provided under a long-
term care insurance policy that is not a qualified long-term care 
insurance policy shall not be treated as an amount received for 
personal injuries or sickness or provided under an accident or health 
plan and shall not be treated as excludible from gross income under any 
provision of this title.
    ``(d) Treatment of Coverage Provided as Part of a Life Insurance 
Contract.--Except as otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by 
the Secretary, in the case of any long-term care insurance coverage 
(whether or not qualified) provided by rider on a life insurance

terms and benefits under a life insurance contract that are in addition 
to the terms and benefits under the contract without regard to the 
coverage under a long-term care insurance policy, except that the 
coverage under a rider described in this subsection shall not fail to 
be treated as such an addition by reason of a reduction in the 
contract's death benefit or cash surrender value resulting from any 
payment under the rider.

as may be necessary to carry out the requirements of this section, 
including regulations to prevent the avoidance of this section by

        subsection:
    ``(c) Exception for Long-Term Care Insurance.--Subsection (a) shall 
not apply to employer-provided coverage under any qualified long-term 
care insurance policy.''

            (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall 
        apply to policies issued after December 31, 1995, except that a

        1996, satisfies the requirements of a qualified long-term care 
        insurance policy as set forth in section 7702B(b) of the 
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as having been 
        issued on January 1, 1996.
            (2) Transition rule.--If, after the date of enactment of 
        this Act and before January 1, 1996, a policy providing for 
        long-term care insurance coverage is exchanged solely for a 
        qualified long-term care insurance policy (as defined in 
        section 7702B(b) of such code), no gain or loss shall be 
        recognized on the exchange, except that gain (if any) shall be 
        recognized to the extent of the sum of the money and the fair 
        market value of the other property received. For purposes of 
        this paragraph, the cancellation of a policy providing for 
        long-term care insurance coverage and reinvestment of the 
        cancellation proceeds in a qualified long-term care insurance 
        policy within 60 days thereafter shall be treated as an 
        exchange.
            (3) Issuance of rider not treated as material change.--For 
        purposes of applying section 101(f), 7702, or 7702A of such 
        Code to any contract, the issuance of a rider on a life 
        insurance contract providing long-term care insurance coverage 
        shall not be treated as a modification or material change of 
        such contract.

                through 2004, which shall consist of estimates (for 
                each year) projecting what Federal outlays or revenues 
                would have been if this Act had not been enacted, for

                                of 7.5 percent of adjusted gross 
                                income.
                    (B) Fiscal years after 2004.--For each fiscal year 
                following fiscal year 2004, the current health spending 
                estimate is the estimate set forth in the executive

        of unfinanced health spending pursuant to subsection (c)(4) for 
        the upcoming fiscal year, the current fiscal year, or the 
        fiscal year which ended the prior October, such determination 
        shall be accompanied by an executive order effective on October 
        1 of that calendar year which fully offsets in the fiscal year 
        beginning October 1 the sum of such unfinanced health spending 
        (for the upcoming fiscal year, the current fiscal year, and the 
        prior fiscal year) in the manner provided in this subsection. 
        Such executive order shall be accompanied by such regulations 
        as are required under subsection (d)(4).
            (2) Offsets.--The offsets required by this subsection shall

                        Social Security Act, and
                            (ii) in the case of the cost-sharing 
                        assistance program, reducing payments to the 
                        States under section 1957 of such Act;
                    (B) reducing the percentage specified in section 
                213(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
                    (C) increasing out-of-pocket limits in the standard 
                and alternative benefits packages as imposed by the 
                National Health Benefits Board pursuant to this Act, to 
                the extent such actions will produce measurable Federal 
                outlay savings.
            (3) Eligibility percentage for pregnant women and children 
        reduced last.--Any reduction under paragraph (2)(A)--

                under sections 1952(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Social Security 
                Act and by reducing the payments to States under 1957 
                of such Act; and
                    (B) to the extent sufficient offsets may not be 
                made under subparagraph (A), shall then be made by 
                reducing the percentage under section 1952(a)(2)(A)(ii) 
                of such Act.
            (4) Proportionality.--The President shall apply the offset 
        mechanisms provided in paragraph (2) (A), (B), and (C)

        subsection (d)(1).
            (5) Consultation.--In making the determinations required by 
        this subsection, the President shall consult with the Director 
        of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, and the National Health Benefits Board. Any order 
        modifying the new tax deductions shall be accompanied by 
        Treasury regulations implementing such modification. Any order 
        modifying out-of-pocket limits shall be accompanied by National 
        Health Benefits Board regulations implementing such 
        modification.
    (e) Carryover of Excess Health Financing.--If the President's 
budget includes a determination of excess health financing pursuant to 
subsection (c)(4) for a fiscal year, such amount shall be included in 
calculating the health reform estimate for the subsequent fiscal year, 
by including such amount in the calculation of total net revenues 
projected for that year under subsection (c)(3)(C)(iii).
    (f) Recommendations for Alternative Reductions.--If the President's 
budget for a fiscal year is accompanied by an executive order under 
subsection (d)(1), the National Health Care Commission shall, within a 
reasonable time, transmit to the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the President of the Senate a report including 
alternative proposals to offset the projected excess outlays.
    (g) GAO Audit of Reductions.--If the President has issued an 
executive order under subsection (d)(1), the General Accounting Office 
shall report to Congress, as soon thereafter as possible following the 
date of transmittal of the President's budget, an analysis of whether 
the executive order has fully complied with the requirements of this 
section.
