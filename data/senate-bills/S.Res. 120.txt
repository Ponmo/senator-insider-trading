S. Res. 120
In the Senate of the United States,
May 4 (legislative day, January 3), 1989.
Whereas the elections in Panama are of critical importance to the United
States and to the people of Panama in determining whether the regime of
General Manuel Noriega will give way to a democratically elected government;
Whereas on May 7, 1989 the Panamanian people will be called on to vote
in elections for a new president, First and Second Vice Presidents, 67
legislators and 505 District Representatives;
Whereas an estimated 900,000 persons are eligible to cast ballots in the
election which officially began on November 7, 1988;
Whereas a fair election requires that the rights of freedom of expression,
association, and assembly be respected and that an accurate tallying of
ballots take place;
Whereas free and fair democratic elections, expressing the will of the people,
have recently been held in countries throughout the Western Hemisphere,
including Venezuela, El Salvador, and Jamaica and a plebiscite in Chile;
Whereas the normalization of the relationship between the United States and
Panama will be enhanced by the holding of free and fair elections in which
the results are respected;
Whereas the Noriega regime has restricted the independent media, has denied
opposition candidates equal access to regime-controlled media outlets,
and has curbed constitutional guarantees, and
Whereas there is growing concern that the regime is manipulating voting
lists, implementing a number of other fraudulent measures and curtailing
the presence of international observer teams: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That it--
  (1) expresses its support for the right of the Panamanian people to have
  a full and genuine democracy in Panama;
  (2) condemns the Noriega regime's attempts to curtail the rights of
  participation in the election process thus far;
  (3) insists the Noriega regime conduct the upcoming election in a free and
  fair manner so that the will of the Panamanian people is freely, fully,

  presence of representatives of the three presidential tickets participating
  in the elections;
  (4) calls upon the Noriega regime to accord full access for electoral
  activities to the official United States observer team, the Carter-Ford
  election observer group, as well as other international observer teams;
  (5) urges President Bush to encourage other democracies around the world
  to send international observer teams to Panama;
  (6) asks the President to report to Congress on the extent to which the
  May 7, 1989 elections in Panama were conducted in a free and fair manner
  and to consult with the Congress on the future course of action for United
