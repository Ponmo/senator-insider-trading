S. Res. 156
In the Senate of the United States,
July 20 (legislative day, January 3), 1989.
Whereas July 20, 1989, marks the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11's landing on
the moon, one of the greatest technological accomplishments in human history,
and therefore as a day of lasting historical significance;
Whereas Americans remember the landing on the lunar surface not only with
a sense of historical significance, but also with one of honor and pride in
the accomplishment of the crew of Apollo 11 and the men and women who made
it possible;
Whereas the United States is a world leader in space research and exploration
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is recognized
and praised worldwide for its accomplishments in aeronautics and space
exploration over the past three decades;
Whereas the United States space program is a tangible and highly visible
demonstration of America's continued pursuit of new frontiers and new
challenges in order to improve our standard of living, broaden our scientific
knowledge, inspire our children, and stimulate the human spirit;
Whereas our commitment to an international civil space program holds the
promise of securing greater progress toward World peace and cooperative
global efforts in confronting and addressing environmental concerns affecting
all mankind;
Whereas the International Space Station Freedom program, to build a permanently
manned space station in earth orbit, is the next logical step in the continuing
exploration of our solar system;
Whereas the President is to be commended for the strong support he announced
today on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the historic Apollo 11
lunar landing, for the International Space Station Freedom and the Mission
to Planet Earth programs and his commitment to maintaining United States
leadership in space by exploring concepts for a lunar base and manned Mars
mission; and
Whereas the International Space Station Freedom program together with
additional orbiting satellities dedicated to monitoring global climatic
processes and changes, comprises a comprehensive and unprecedented scientific
study known as the `Mission to Planet Earth': Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
  (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the crew of
  Apollo 11, and all those associated with the first lunar landing should
  be congratulated on the 20th anniversary of the success of the Apollo
  11 mission;
  (2) the most appropriate celebration of the first lunar landing is the
  continued and renewed support of the Senate and the American people for our
  space program, and in particular the International Space Station Freedom
  program, one of our next and necessary civilian space objectives; and
  (3) the additional elements of Earth sensing satellites needed to achieve
  the goals of the `Mission to Planet Earth' should be vigorously pursued
  in a cooperative global effort involving all Nations of the World.
  SEC. 2. It is further the sense of the Senate that the President of the
  United States, the Vice President of the United States in his capacity as
  the Chairman of the National Space Council, the Director of the Office of
  Management and Budget, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and
  Space Administration, and the appropriate committees of the Senate and House
  of Representatives should together explore all actions as may be necessary
  to provide the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's fiscal year
  1990 budget request for the International Space Station Freedom program
  to insure the continued development of this program and the expeditious
  development of the global environmental program envisioned as the `Mission
  to Planet Earth'.
Attest:
Secretary.
