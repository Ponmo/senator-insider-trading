A BILL
To amend the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to require new
standards for corporate average fuel economy, and for other purposes.
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
  States of America in Congress assembled,
 [Struck out->] That this Act may be cited as the `Motor Vehicle Fuel
 Efficiency Act of 1989'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] FINDINGS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   SEC. 2. The Congress finds and declares the following:
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) Improved efficiency in the consumption of petroleum is
 vitally important, not only because the worldwide supply is finite, but becaue
 the increasing dependence of the United States on foreign oil is a threat to
 our national security and adversely affects the trade balance. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) The light duty vehicle fleet is a significant
 user of oil, accounting for about 39 percent of United States oil
 consumption. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) Improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency between 1973 and
 1987 amounted to a savings of one million eight hundred thousand barrels of
 oil per day and a savings to drivers of close to $30,000,000,000. Conversely,
 the rollback of the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard for
 the 1989 model year, from 27.5 miles per gallon to 26.5 miles per gallon,
 is expected to result in increased consumption of nine hundred million
 gallons of fuel over the life of the vehicles. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (4) Emissions of carbon dioxide, including those from the
 light duty vehicle fleet, contribute substantially to increased retention
 of heat in the Earth's atmosphere and may cause long term global warming
 and disruption of climate-dependent activities. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (5) The United States, with only 5 percent of the
 world's population, is responsible for 20 percent of world carbon dioxide
 emissions. United States carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline alone are
 greater than the carbon dioxide emissions from all sources in each of the
 following countries and areas of the world: Latin America, Japan, the Middle
 East, West Germany, South and Southeast Asia, the United Kingdom, Africa,
 and France. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (6) The Transportation sector is responsible for 31 percent
 of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. Each gallon of gasoline
 burned results in the emission of 19.7 pounds of carbon dioxide. [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   (7) The rollback of the CAFE standard for the 1989 model
 year is projected to result in nine million tons of additional carbon
 dioxide emissions during the life of the vehicles involved. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (8) Increased numbers of vehicles and vehicle miles
 traveled in the United States will necessitate a 3 percent annual increase
 in fuel efficiency merely to hold future carbon dioxide emissions at current
 levels. Therefore, substantial improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency will
 be needed to reduce these emissions. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (9) CAFE standards and the successful response of automobile
 manufacturers to those standards have been very effective in increasing
 vehicle fuel efficiency, resulting in a doubling of the passenger car fleet
 fuel economy between 1975 and the present. However, current law does not
 require improvement above a standard of 27.5 miles per gallon which became
 effective in 1985. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (10) Light trucks were an insignificant part of the passenger
 vehicle market when CAFE standards were enacted in 1975, and have not been
 subjected to strict, legislatively established, CAFE standards. As a result,
 there have been few major technological changes related to fuel efficiency
 in the standard size light trucks since 1982, and fuel economy in some light
 truck models has actually declined between 1982 and 1986. Light trucks have
 become increasingly popular for passenger use, and such vehicles now account
 for approximately one-third of new passenger vehicle sales. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (11) The Office of Technology Assessment and the Department
 of Energy agree that increased fuel efficiency is possible utilizing
 currently available technology and without significant changes in the size
 mix or performance of the fleet. Using conventional technologies, it is
 estimated that the fuel economy of the entire new care fleet could range
 from thirty-three to thirty-eight miles per gallon by 1995. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (12) Over the long term, by utilizing technology currently
 in production or in prototype, additional increases in fleet fuel economy
 beyond 1995 estimates are achievable, from forty miles per gallon to as
 high as sixty miles per gallon in the next decade. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (12) Gasoline prices currently are lower in real dollars
 then they have been since the early 1970's. Since there is at least some
 correlation between gasoline prices and consumer demand for fuel efficient
 vehicles, it is unlikely that the market alone will achieve significant
 improvement in fuel economy. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (13) Increased CAFE standards are, therefore, both
 reasonable and necessary to ensure that improvements in fuel efficiency
 continue in furtherance of the dual goals of the Nation's energy security
 and decreased carbon dioxide emissions. [<-Struck out]

 [Struck out->] `MODIFICATIONS OF STANDARDS [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `SEC. 516. (a) Any time after the beginning of fiscal
 year 1995, any person may petition the Secretary to modify any average
 fuel economy standard established under this Act for model year 2001 and
 thereafter. In response to such a petition, the Secretary may increase or
 decrease such standard to the level which the Secretary determines is the
 maximum feasible average fuel economy for the relevant model year (taking
 into consideration the factors listed in section 502(e)), except that
 the Secretary shall not reduce any such standard below a standard equal
 to a 30 percent increase over the average fuel economy achieved by the
 manufacturer involved for the applicable type (or class) of vehicles for
 model year 1988. Any such petition shall be filed at least twelve months in
 advance of the model year to which it is applicable. Upon receipt of such a
 petition, the Secretary shall conduct a rulemaking proceeding, which shall
 be conducted in accordance with the following procedure: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) The Secretary-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) shall publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
 which specifies the type (or class) of vehicles to which the rule may apply;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) shall invite interested persons to submit, within
 sixty days after the date of publication of such advance notice, written
 presentations of data, views, and arguments in response to such notice;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) may identify proposed or amended standards that may
 be prescribed. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended average fuel
 economy standard, or prescribes no amended standard, for a type (or class)
 of vehicles shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any
 such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall consider
 the four factors listed in section 502(e) and shall determine the maximum
 improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that
 is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of vehicles. If such
 standard is not designed to achieve such maximum improvement or maximum
 reduction, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons
 therefor. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) After the publication of the proposed rulemaking,
 the Secretary shall afford interested persons an opportunity, during a
 period of not less than sixty days, to comment on matters relating to the
 proposed rule. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4) A final rule prescribing an amended average fuel
 economy standard, or prescribing no amended standard, for a type (or class)
 of vehicles shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than
 one hundred and twenty days, after publication of the proposed rule in the
 Federal Register. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) In determining the maximum feasible average fuel
 economy during a rulemaking proceeding under this section, the Secretary
 shall evaluate the economic practicability of the standard, considering--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers
 and on the consumers of the vehicles subject to such standard; [<-Struck out]

 vehicles likely to result from the imposition of the standard; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(5) the impact of any lessening of competition or any
 change in foreign trade that is likely to result from the imposition of
 the standard; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(6) the need for reducing carbon dioxide emissions
 to mitigate the global greenhouse warming, as well as reducing other
 environmentally damaging energy-related pollutants; [<-Struck out]

 the Secretary of Transportation, the measurements and calculations under
 section 503(d)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act
 (15 U.S.C. 2003(d)(1)), for purposes of monitoring automobile performance
 in use to determine the extent, if any, of decline in fuel economy after
 such use. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (b) The Administrator shall, within twelve months after
 the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, submit to the
 Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the
 Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report
 on the results of the study required by subsection (a) of this section. The

 in the two model years immediately preceding the model year involved in
 the assessment; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) during each of such preceding years and the year
 involved in the assessment, the applicable average fuel economy standard
 exceeded the average fuel economy of the vehicles manufactured by such
 manufacturer by five-tenths of a mile per gallon or more.'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (b) Section 507(a)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Information and
 Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2007(a)(1)) is amended by inserting `including
 sections 514 and 515,' immediately after `section 502(b)),'. [<-Struck out]
That this Act may be cited as the `Motor Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Act of 1990'.
FINDINGS
  SEC. 2. The Congress finds and declares the following:
  (1) Improved efficiency in the consumption of petroleum is vitally important,
  not only because the worldwide supply is finite, but because the increasing
  dependence of the United States on foreign oil is a threat to our national
  security and adversely affects the trade balance.
  (2) The light duty vehicle fleet is a significant user of oil, accounting
  for about 39 percent of United States oil consumption.
  (3) Improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency between 1973 and 1987 amounted to
  a savings of 1.8 million barrels of oil per day and a savings to drivers of
  close to $30 billion. Conversely, the rollback of the corporate average fuel
  economy (CAFE) standard for the 1989 model year, from 27.5 miles per gallon
  to 26.5 miles per gallon, is expected to result in increased consumption
  of 900 million gallons of fuel over the life of the 1989 vehicles.
  (4) Emissions of carbon dioxide, including those from the light duty
  vehicle fleet, contribute substantially to increased retention of heat in
  the Earth's atmosphere and may cause long term global warming and disruption
  of climate-dependent activities.
  (5) The United States, with only 5 percent of the world's population, is
  responsible for 20 percent of world carbon dioxide emissions. United States
  carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline alone are greater than the carbon
  dioxide emissions from all sources in each of the following countries and
  areas of the world: Latin America, Japan, the Middle East, West Germany,
  South and Southeast Asia, the United Kingdom, Africa, and France.
  (6) The transportation sector is responsible for 31 percent of carbon
  dioxide emissions in the United States. Each gallon of gasoline burned
  results in the emission of 19.7 pounds of carbon dioxide.
  (7) The rollback of the CAFE standard for the 1989 model year is projected
  to result in 9 million tons of additional carbon dioxide emissions during
  the life of the 1989 vehicles.
  (8) Increased numbers of vehicles and vehicle miles traveled in the United
  States will necessitate a 3 percent annual increase in fuel efficiency
  merely to hold future carbon dioxide emissions at current levels. Therefore,
  substantial improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency will be needed to
  reduce these emissions.
  (9) CAFE standards and the successful response of automobile manufacturers
  to those standards have been very effective in increasing vehicle fuel
  efficiency, resulting in a doubling of the passenger car fleet fuel
  economy between 1975 and the present. However, current law does not require
  improvement above a standard of 27.5 miles per gallon which became effective
  in 1985. In recent years, the average fuel economy of the fleets of certain
  manufacturers has actually declined.
  (10) Light trucks were an insignificant part of the passenger vehicle market
  when CAFE standards were enacted in 1975, and have not been subjected
  to strict, legislatively-established, CAFE standards. As a result, there
  have been few major technological changes related to fuel efficiency in
  the standard size light trucks since 1982, and fuel economy in some light
  truck models has actually declined between 1982 and 1986. Light trucks
  have become increasingly popular for passenger use, and such vehicles now
  account for approximately one-third of new passenger vehicle sales.
  (11) The Office of Technology Assessment and the Department of Energy
  agree that increased fuel efficiency is possible utilizing currently
  available technology and without significant changes in the size mix or
  performance of the fleet. With maximum use of conventional technologies,
  it is estimated by various experts that the fuel economy of the entire
  new car fleet could range from 33 to 38 miles per gallon by 1995.
  (12) Over the long term, by utilizing technology currently in production
  or in prototype, additional increases in fleet fuel economy beyond 1995
  estimates are achievable, from 40 miles per gallon to as high as 60 miles
  per gallon in the next decade.
  (13) Gasoline prices currently are lower in real dollars than they have
  been since the early 1970s. Since there is at least some correlation
  between gasoline prices and consumer demand for fuel efficient vehicles,
  it is unlikely that the market alone will achieve significant improvement
  in fuel economy.
  (14) An increase in fuel efficiency in the light duty vehicle fleet of 20
  percent by 1995 and 40 percent by 2001 would save 49.1 billion gallons of
  fuel between 1995 and 2001. This level of improvement also would reduce
  carbon dioxide emissions by 483.5 million tons between 1995 and 2001.
  (15) Use of a percentage improvement requirement is the only legislative
  approach currently available that assures achievement of the environmental
  and energy security goals to be served by a fuel efficiency standard. Such an
  approach ensures that each manufacturer is required to achieve significant
  improvement in fuel efficiency. By contrast, use of the same numerical
  standards for all manufacturers provides no incentive for manufacturers of
  primarily small vehicles to improve the fuel efficiency of those vehicles,
  and in effect establishes no standard for such manufacturers. The separate
  size or weight class standards presently available do not, standing alone,
  prohibit increases in the size and weight of the fleet as a whole, and so
  do not ensure that fuel savings will actually result from such standards.
  (16) Increased CAFE standards that require all manufacturers to improve by
  the same percentage are, therefore, both reasonable and necessary to ensure
  that improvements in fuel efficiency continue, in furtherance of the dual
  goals of the Nation's energy security and decreased carbon dioxide emissions.

For each such manufacturer, the average fuel economy required shall be an
amount determined by the Secretary to be equal to the average fuel economy
achieved by that manufacturer for passenger automobiles in model year 1988,
plus an amount equal to 40 percent (as measured in miles per gallon) of such
average fuel economy achieved for model year 1988, unless such standard is
modified under section 516; except that such standard shall not be less than
33 miles per gallon and shall not exceed 45 miles per gallon.
`AUTOMOBILES OTHER THAN PASSENGER AUTOMOBILES
  `SEC. 515. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, commencing
  with model year 1995 and each model year thereafter, the average fuel

amount determined by the Secretary to be equal to the average fuel economy
achieved by that manufacturer in model year 1988, plus an amount equal to
40 percent (as measured in miles per gallon) of such average fuel economy
achieved for model year 1988, unless such standard is modified under section
516; except that such standard shall not be less than 24 miles per gallon
and shall not exceed 35 miles per gallon.
`MODIFICATIONS OF STANDARDS
  `SEC. 516. (a) Any time after the beginning of fiscal year 1995,
  the Secretary may modify any average fuel economy standard established
  under this Act for model year 2001 and thereafter in accordance with
  this section. In response to a petition from any person that is filed at
  least 12 months in advance of the model year to which it is applicable,
  the Secretary shall conduct a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether
  to increase or decrease such standard to the level which the Secretary
  determines is the maximum feasible average fuel economy for that model year
  (taking into consideration the factors listed in section 502(e) and the
  need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions), except that the Secretary shall
  not reduce any such standard below a standard equal to a 30-percent increase
  over the average fuel economy achieved by the manufacturer involved for the
  applicable type (or class) of vehicles for model year 1988. The Secretary
  may also conduct such a rulemaking on the Secretary's initiative.
  `(b) In determining the maximum feasible average fuel economy during a
  rulemaking proceeding under this section, the Secretary shall weigh equally
  each factor listed in section 502(e) and the need to reduce carbon dioxide
  emissions. In evaluating the economic practicability of the standard,
  the Secretary shall consider--
  `(1) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the
  consumers of the vehicles subject to such standard;
  `(2) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life
  of the vehicle compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial
  charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the vehicles which are likely to
  result from the imposition of the standard;
  `(3) the total projected amount of energy savings likely to result
  directly from the imposition of the standard and the economic impact of
  such energy savings;
  `(4) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the vehicles likely
  to result from the imposition of the standard;
  `(5) the impact of any lessening of competition or any change in foreign
  trade that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;
  `(6) the total projected amount of reduction in carbon dioxide emissions
  and the economic impact of such reduction; and
  `(7) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.'.
