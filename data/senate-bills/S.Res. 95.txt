                               RESOLUTION


 
      Relating to the death of the Holy Father, Pope John Paul II.

Whereas Pope John Paul II was one of the greatest spiritual leaders and moral 
        teachers of the Modern Era;
Whereas he set an extraordinary example of personal integrity and courage, not 
        only for his fellow Catholics but for people of every religious and 
        philosophical viewpoint;
Whereas throughout the course of his pontificate he campaigned tirelessly for 
        human rights and human dignity throughout the world;
Whereas he practiced and inspired resistance to the great totalitarian systems 
        and tyrannies that rose and, with his help, fell in the 20th Century;
Whereas he fostered harmony between Catholics and Eastern Orthodox and 
        Protestant Christians, reached out in friendship to Jews, Muslims and 
        members of other faiths, and warmly promoted interfaith understanding 
        and cooperation;
Whereas he dedicated himself to the defense of the weakest and most vulnerable 
        members of the human family;
Whereas on his visits to our country he has called all Americans to be true and 
        faithful to the great principles of liberty and justice inscribed in our 
        Declaration of Independence and Constitution; and
Whereas his selfless service to God and man has been an inspiration to Americans 
        and men and women of goodwill across the globe: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate of the United States joins the world in 
mourning his death, and pays tribute to him by pledging to be ever 
faithful to our national calling to be ``one Nation, under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all'', and to help our 
neighbors in immeasurable ways.
                                 <all>
