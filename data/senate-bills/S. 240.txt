        actual intent of misleading investors;
            ``(2) except to the extent otherwise specifically provided

arising under this title, the court shall stay discovery during the 
pendency of any motion by a defendant (other than discovery that is 
specifically directed to the applicability of the exemption provided 
for in this section) for summary judgment that is based on the grounds 
that--
            ``(1) the statement or omission upon which the complaint is 
        based is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of this 
        section; and

section, the Commission may, by rule or regulation, provide exemptions 
from liability under any provision of this title, or of any rule or 
regulation issued under this title, that is based on a statement that 
includes or that is based on projections or other forward-looking 
information, if and to the extent that any such exemption is, as 
determined by the Commission, consistent with the public interest and 
the protection of investors.
    ``(f) Commission Disgorgement Actions.--
            ``(1) In general.--If the Commission, in any proceeding, 
        orders or obtains (by settlement, court order, or otherwise) a 
        payment of funds from a person who has violated this title 
        through means that included the utilization of a forward-
        looking statement, and if any portion of such funds is set 
        aside or otherwise held for or available to persons who 
        suffered losses in connection with such violation, no person 
        shall be precluded from participating in the distribution of, 
        or otherwise receiving, a portion of such funds by reason of 
        the application of this section.

        Commission alleging a violation of this title in which the 
        defendant or respondent is alleged to have utilized a forward-
        looking statement in furtherance of such violation, the 
        Commission may, upon a sufficient showing, in addition to all 
        other remedies available to the Commission, obtain a judgment 
        for the payment of an amount equal to all losses suffered by 
        reason of the utilization of the forward-looking statement.
    ``(g) Effect on Other Authority of Commission.--Nothing in this 
section limits, either expressly or by implication, the authority of 
the Commission to exercise similar authority or to adopt similar rules 
and regulations with respect to forward-looking statements under any 
other statute under which the Commission exercises rulemaking 
authority.''.

        such rules and regulations as may be necessary to describe 
        conduct with respect to the making of forward-looking 
        statements that the Commission deems does not provide a basis 
        for liability in any private action arising under this title.
            ``(2) Requirements.--A rule or regulation promulgated under 
        paragraph (1) shall--

        of that payment; or
            ``(4) from any other person responsible for the conduct 
        giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to make 
        the same payment.
    ``(f) Nondisclosure to Jury.--The standard for allocation of 
damages under subsections (b) and (c) and the procedure for 
reallocation of uncollectible shares under subsection (d) shall not be 
disclosed to members of the jury.
    ``(g) Settlement Discharge.--
            ``(1) In general.--A defendant who settles any private 
        action arising under this title at any time before final 
        verdict or judgment shall be discharged from all claims for 
        contribution brought by other persons. Upon entry of the 
        settlement by the court, the court shall enter a bar order 
        constituting the final discharge of all obligations to the 
        plaintiff of the settling defendant arising out of the action. 
        The order shall bar all future claims for contribution arising 
        out of the action--
                    ``(A) by any person against the settling defendant; 
                and
                    ``(B) by the settling defendant against any person, 
                other than a person whose liability has been 
                extinguished by the settlement of the settling 
                defendant.
            ``(2) Reduction.--If a person enters into a settlement with 
        the plaintiff prior to final verdict or judgment, the verdict 
        or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--
                    ``(A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage 
                of responsibility of that person; or
                    ``(B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that 
                person.
    ``(h) Contribution.--A person who becomes liable for damages in any 
private action arising under this title may recover contribution from 
any other person who, if joined in the original action, would have been 
liable for the same damages. A claim for contribution shall be 
determined based on the percentage of responsibility of the claimant 
and of each person against whom a claim for contribution is made.
    ``(i) Statute of Limitations for Contribution.--Once judgment has 
been entered in any private action arising under this title determining 
liability, an action for contribution shall be brought not later than 6 
months after the entry of a final, nonappealable judgment in the 
action, except that an action for contribution brought by a defendant 
who was required to make an additional payment pursuant to subsection 
(d) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date on which such 
payment was made.''.

            TITLE III--AUDITOR DISCLOSURE OF CORPORATE FRAUD

SEC. 301. FRAUD DETECTION AND DISCLOSURE.

    (a) In General.--The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.) is amended by inserting immediately after section 10 the 
following new section:

``SEC. 10A. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS.

    ``(a) In General.--Each audit required pursuant to this title of 
the financial statements of an issuer by an independent public 
accountant shall include, in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented from time to 
time by the Commission--
            ``(1) procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance 
        of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material 
        effect on the determination of financial statement amounts;
            ``(2) procedures designed to identify related party 
        transactions that are material to the financial statements or 
        otherwise require disclosure therein; and
            ``(3) an evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt 
        about the ability of the issuer to continue as a going concern 
        during the ensuing fiscal year.
    ``(b) Required Response To Audit Discoveries.--
            ``(1) Investigation and report to management.--If, in the 
        course of conducting an audit pursuant to this title to which 
        subsection (a) applies, the independent public accountant 
        detects or otherwise becomes aware of information indicating 
        that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a 
        material effect on the financial statements of the issuer) has 
        or may have occurred, the accountant shall, in accordance with 
        generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or 
        supplemented from time to time by the Commission--
                    ``(A)(i) determine whether it is likely that an 
                illegal act has occurred; and
                    ``(ii) if so, determine and consider the possible 
                effect of the illegal act on the financial statements 
                of the issuer, including any contingent monetary 
                effects, such as fines, penalties, and damages; and
                    ``(B) as soon as practicable, inform the 
                appropriate level of the management of the issuer and 
                assure that the audit committee of the issuer, or the 
                board of directors of the issuer in the absence of such 
                a committee, is adequately informed with respect to 
                illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise 
                come to the attention of such accountant in the course 
                of the audit, unless the illegal act is clearly 
                inconsequential.
            ``(2) Response to failure to take remedial action.--If, 
        after determining that the audit committee of the board of 
        directors of the issuer, or the board of directors of the 
        issuer in the absence of an audit committee, is adequately 
        informed with respect to illegal acts that have been detected 
        or have otherwise come to the attention of the accountant in 
        the course of the audit of such accountant, the independent 
        public accountant concludes that--
                    ``(A) the illegal act has a material effect on the 
                financial statements of the issuer;
                    ``(B) the senior management has not taken, and the 
                board of directors has not caused senior management to 
                take, timely and appropriate remedial actions with 
                respect to the illegal act; and
                    ``(C) the failure to take remedial action is 
                reasonably expected to warrant departure from a 
                standard report of the auditor, when made, or warrant 
                resignation from the audit engagement;
        the independent public accountant shall, as soon as 
        practicable, directly report its conclusions to the board of 
        directors.
            ``(3) Notice to commission; response to failure to 
        notify.--An issuer whose board of directors receives a report 
        under paragraph (2) shall inform the Commission by notice not 
        later than 1 business day after the receipt of such report and 
        shall furnish the independent public accountant making such 
        report with a copy of the notice furnished to the Commission. 
        If the independent public accountant fails to receive a copy of 
        the notice before the expiration of the required 1-business-day 
        period, the independent public accountant shall--
                    ``(A) resign from the engagement; or
                    ``(B) furnish to the Commission a copy of its 
                report (or the documentation of any oral report given) 
                not later than 1 business day following such failure to 
                receive notice.
            ``(4) Report after resignation.--If an independent public 
        accountant resigns from an engagement under paragraph (3)(A), 
        the accountant shall, not later than 1 business day following 
        the failure by the issuer to notify the Commission under 
        paragraph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the 
        accountant's report (or the documentation of any oral report 
        given).
    ``(c) Auditor Liability Limitation.--No independent public 
accountant shall be liable in a private action for any finding, 
conclusion, or statement expressed in a report made pursuant to 
paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b), including any rule promulgated 
pursuant thereto.
    ``(d) Civil Penalties in Cease-and-Desist Proceedings.--If the 
Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in a 
proceeding instituted pursuant to section 21C, that an independent 
public accountant has willfully violated paragraph (3) or (4) of 
subsection (b), the Commission may, in addition to entering an order 
under section 21C, impose a civil penalty against the independent 
public accountant and any other person that the Commission finds was a 
cause of such violation. The determination to impose a civil penalty 
and the amount of the penalty shall be governed by the standards set 
forth in section 21B.
    ``(e) Preservation of Existing Authority.--Except as provided in 
subsection (d), nothing in this section shall be held to limit or 
otherwise affect the authority of the Commission under this title.
    ``(f) Definition.--As used in this section, the term `illegal act' 
means an act or omission that violates any law, or any rule or 
regulation having the force of law.''.
    (b) Effective Dates.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to each annual report--
            (1) for any period beginning on or after January 1, 1996, 
        with respect to any registrant that is required to file 
        selected quarterly financial data pursuant to the rules or 
        regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and
            (2) for any period beginning on or after January 1, 1997, 
        with respect to any other registrant.
