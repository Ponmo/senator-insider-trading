LIMITATIONS ON THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE
  SEC. 8098. (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) has become too focused on a
  projected 1993 Presidential decision on whether the United States will deploy
  a space-based kinetic energy weapon system, known as `brilliant pebbles'.
  (2) There has been tremendous instability in the Phase I architecture of
  the strategic defense system.
  (3) A decision to deploy the phase I architecture of that system would
  have grave implications for offensive arms reduction negotiations with
  the Soviet Union and for continued United States compliance with the 1972
  Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
  (4) Changes in the international political environment over the past year
  permit the United States to pursue the SDI program at a more measured pace,
  with increased emphasis on theater and anti-tactical ballistic missile
  contingencies.
  (5) A broad-based research program on the feasibility of highly effective
  missile defenses remains in the national interest.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
  (1) the Strategic Defense Initiative should not be focused on the projected
  1993 Presidential decision on deployment of a space-based kinetic energy
  weapon system;
  (2) the Strategic Defense Initiative should continue a balanced, robust
  program of research on those technologies that offer the prospect of highly
  effective anti-ballistic missile defenses;
  (3) priority under the Strategic Defense Initiative should be given,
  in the near term, to research on a defense system that (A) would protect
  against an accidental missile launch against the United States or a limited
  ballistic missile attack against the United States by a third-world country,
  and (B) if deployed, would not be in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
  Missile Treaty.
  (4) the Strategic Defense Initiative should include a vigorous pursuit of
  a variety of theater and anti-tactical ballistic missile defenses which
  would be of value to allies of the United States and to the military forces
  of the United States temporarily or permanently deployed within range of
  tactical ballistic missiles of a potential enemy; and
  (5) the Strategic Defense Initiative should continue support, as it has
  over the past six years, for those critical technology efforts that have
  both civil and military applications in areas other than ballistic missile
  defense systems.
  (c) LIMITATIONS ON SPENDING- Of the funds appropriated under title IV
  pursuant to section 201 for the Strategic Defense Initiative--
  (1) not more than $345,000,000 may be obligated for the ground-based radar,
  space-based surveillance and tracking system program, and ground-based
  surveillance and tracking system program;
  (2) not more than $142,000,000 may be obligated for the ground-based
  interceptor program;
  (3) not more than $129,000,000 may be obligated for the brilliant pebbles
  program;
  (4) not more than $894,300,000 may be obligated for other phase I programs;
  (5) not more than $944,400,000 may be obligated for follow-on technologies
  programs;
  (6) not more than $320,000,000 may be obligated for key technologies
  activities;
  (7) not more than $227,800,000 may be obligated for operational support
  and management activities;
  (8) not more than $180,000,000 may be obligated for test and evaluation
  activities;
  (9) not more than $180,000,000 may be obligated for theater defense
  activities, of which not more than $42,000,000 may be expended for an
  advanced development program for an anti-tactical ballistic missile system
  with the Government of Israel;
  (10) not more than $116,800,000 may be obligated for the innovative science
  and technology and small business innovative research programs; and
  (11) not more than $93,700,000 may be obligated for engineering analysis
  activities.
  (d) BUDGET INFORMATION- With respect to each program and activity specified
  in clauses (1) through (11) of subsection (c), the Secretary of Defense
  shall include in budget justification materials submitted to Congress after
  the date of the enactment of this Act for any fiscal year, and in each
  annual report submitted to Congress after such date pursuant to section
  224 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and
  1991 (10 U.S.C. 2431 note), a description of the program or activity, any
  changes made in the program or activity since the last budget justification
