  who are providing coverage for a spouse or former spouse beneficiary under
  that Plan to also provide a supplemental annuity for that spouse or former

  beneficiary becomes 62 years of age.
  `(b) AMOUNT OF ANNUITY FOR BENEFICIARY OF PERSON PROVIDING STANDARD ANNUITY
  UNDER SBP- In the case of a person providing a standard annuity for a spouse
  or former spouse beneficiary under the Survivor Benefit Plan and providing
  a supplemental spouse annuity for that beneficiary under this subchapter,
  the monthly annuity payable to the beneficiary under this subchapter shall
  be the amount equal to 20 percent of the base amount under the Survivor

  computed as of the date of the death of the person providing the annuity,

  under this subchapter shall be determined as follows:
  `(1) BENEFICIARY INITIALLY 62 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER- If the beneficiary
  is 62 years of age or older when the beneficiary becomes entitled to the
  reserve-component annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan, the monthly
  amount of the supplemental spouse annuity is the difference between--

  beneficiary's annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan is reduced (on the
  same day) under section 1451(d) of this title.
  (3) EXCLUSION OF DIC OFFSET- Computations under paragraphs (1) and (2)
  shall be made without regard to any reduction required under section 1450(c)

  of dependency and indemnity compensation under section 411 of title 38.
  `(d) ADJUSTMENTS IN ANNUITIES-

  same percent as the percent by which the annuity of that beneficiary is
  increased or recomputed under the Survivor Benefit Plan.

  subchapter, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the next lower
  multiple of $1.

  (2) the implications for United States strategic force posture in a START
  environment of a fleet of 21 or more Trident submarines, each with 192
  warheads on 24 ballistic missiles, under two different assumptions:
  (i) all such warheads are accountable under START limits;
  (ii) the warheads on 1-3 Trident submarines are not accountable under
  START limits;
  (3) a net assessment of the implications for United States security of
  a START agreement that allowed the Soviets as well as the United States
  to have an equivalent number of warheads on submarines that would not be
  accountable under START limits;
  (4) the technical feasibility and cost implications of various options
  for reducing the number of warheads on Trident submarines, including those

SEC. 919. KIDNAPPING OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL HIGGINS
  (a)(1) The radical, Lebanese-based terrorist organization which calls
  itself the `Organization of the Oppressed of the Earth' announced July 31,
  1989 that it had executed Lieutenant Colonel William R. Higgins, a Marine
  seconded to UNTSO, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization,
  and kidnapped in South Lebanon on February 17, 1988.
  (2) That Organization claimed to have executed Colonel Higgins in response
  to the recent capture by Israeli commandos of a radical Muslim Shiite leader,
  Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, believed to be associated with that Organization.
  (3) That Organization released to certain news agencies a video tape
  purporting to show Lieutenant Colonel Higgins executed by hanging.
  (4) It has not been confirmed that the execution of Lieutenant Colonel
  Higgins has taken place, nor have any details been provided about the
  alleged execution.
  (5) The kidnapping of Lieutenant Colonel Higgins, who was engaged only in
  carrying out the legitimate United Nations peacekeeping activities he had
  been assigned, was wholly unjustified.
  (6) It is absolutely clear that the kidnapping of Lieutenant Colonel
  Higgins and his execution, if it indeed has occurred, are outrageous acts
  of terrorism which deserve the condemnation of all civilized people.
  (7) There is strong evidence that the Government of Iran has supported the
  Organization responsible for Lieutenant Colonel Higgins's kidnapping and
  alleged execution, as well as other terrorist and extremist forces inside
  Lebanon and throughout the Middle East.
  (b) It is the sense of the Senate that:
  (1) The Senate is outraged by the kidnapping and the reports of Colonel
  Higgins's execution, and condemns such actions as barbaric, cowardly,
  and utterly incompatible with the standards of conduct upheld by civilized
  people.
  (2) The President should utilize all available resources of the United
  States Government, including all available diplomatic and intelligence
  channels, to determine the identity of those responsible and the details
  regarding such terrorist acts.
  (3) The President should determine whether it would be possible to isolate
  and bring to justice or retaliate against those responsible in a manner
  that would reduce the risk to Americans from terrorism.
  (4) The President should retaliate as would be appropriate and feasible.
  (5) The United States should make clear to the new leadership in Iran that
  we will not tolerate a continuation of past policies of support of groups
  which undertake terrorist actions against American citizens or direct
  assaults on American vital interests in the Middle East or elsewhere, and
  should such support continue, the United States will hold the authorities
  in Iran accountable for that support and act accordingly.
  (6) The United Nations Secretary General should take all necessary steps
  to help ensure that Lieutenant Colonel Higgins, if still alive, is safely
  returned to the United States, and, if dead, that his body is returned
  to his country and family, and that those responsible for his death be
  immediately brought to justice.
  (7) The President should engage in urgent and continuing diplomatic
  contacts with the Government of Israel and other governments concerning
  their policies and actions which might have relevance to the interests of
  the United States Government or increase the vulnerability of the United
  States citizens to attacks by terrorists.
  (8) the President should consult with other nations to ensure international
  cooperation and coordination to end terrorist attacks.

SEC. 921. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO ACCIDENTAL LAUNCH PROTECTION
  (a)(1) The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) has made substantial progress
  in developing technologies to defend the United States from a possible
  ballistic missile attack, be it deliberate or accidential.
  (2) Technological advances in interceptors, sensors, and command, control and
  communications have been achieved and key elements of the SDI program have
  recently been combined to form the basic architecture for a possible Phase I
  defense system to defend the United States against ballistic missile attack.
  (3) The Soviet Union maintains the world's only operational ballistic
  missile defense system and has deployed such a system in the Moscow area.
  (4) There exists significant asymmetries in United States and Soviet
  anti-ballistic missile (ABM) production and capabilities and the ability
  of the United States to counter a Soviet deployment of a nationwide or
  more limited ABM system.
  (5) Ground-based elements and their associated adjuncts and technologies
  represent the most mature technologies within the SDI program and should
  therefore receive priority by the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization.
  (6) The United States is a signatory to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
  Treaty.
  (7) There have been several accidents involving ballistic missiles,
  including the loss of a submarine of the Soviet Union due to inadvertent
  missile ignition and the inadvertent landing in China of a test missile
  of the Soviet Union.
  (8) The continued proliferation of offensive ballistic missile forces
  by non-superpower countries hostile to the United States and our allies
  raises the possibility of future nuclear threats.
  (b) It is the sense of Congress--
  (1) that the Secretary of Defense should direct the Strategic Defense
  Initiative Organization to give priority to the development of technologies
  and systems for a system capable of protecting the United States from the
  accidental launch of a strategic ballistic missile against the continental
  United States;
  (2) that such development of an accidental launch protection system
  should be carried out with an objective of ensuring that such system is
  in compliance with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty; and
  (3) that the Secretary of Defense should submit to Congress forthwith the
  report on the status of planning for development of a deployment option for
  such an accidental launch protection system as required by section 224(c)
  of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law
  100-456; 102 Stat. 1943).
SEC. 922. SERVICE IN NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES
  (a) The Senate finds that--
  (1) American Citizens have taken up arms to defend their homes and
  communities, and to preserve this nation's independence, from the earliest
  days of our nation;
  (2) The concept of the citizen-soldier has been a keystone of the defense
  strategy of this nation;
  (3) Members of the National Guard and Reserve have served proudly and
  honorably in every war or conflict involving United States Armed Forces;
  (4) The Total Force Policy, by placing significant portions of wartime
  mission capability and selected day-to-day operations in the National
  Guard and Reserve, has reinforced the proposition that the Guard and
  Reserve are essential elements of our national defense;
  (5) The Congress and the Department of Defense during the 1980's have
  demonstrated their increasing reliance and confidence in the National
  Guard and Reserve by expanding missions, increasing training requirements
  and providing new state-of-the-art weapons and support equipment;
  (6) The National Guard and Reserve represent a very cost-effective arm of
  the Total Force, preserving combat capability and retaining valuable trained
  human resources, especially during periods of austere defense budgets;
  (7) Participation in the National Guard and Reserve enhances military
  readiness and demonstrates the resolve of the citizenry to protect and
  preserve American values; and
  (8) Participation in the National Guard and Reserve improves our economy,
  by providing individuals with job skills and education.
  (b) Therefore be it declared, that the United States Senate reaffirms that
  service in the National Guard and Reserve is in the highest traditions of
  military service to the country and acknowledges the valuable contribution
  that the men and women who serve in the National Guard and Reserve are
  making to their country; encourages Guard and Reserve participation by
  all elements of our society; and continues to support fully, reliance on
  the National Guard and Reserve as full partners in the Total Force.
SEC. 923. PRESIDENTIAL REPORT ON THE VERIFICATION WORK THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED
WITH REGARD TO MOBILE ICBMs IN A START TREATY
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The United States and the Soviet Union are currently engaged in talks
  regarding the reduction of strategic nuclear arms.
  (2) The United States position at the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
  (START) since 1985 has been to ban the deployment of mobile ICBMs within

  a summary of conclusions reached.
SEC. 924. SENSE OF SENATE ON START TALKS
  It is the sense of the Senate that any agreement negotiated by the President
  to achieve a reduction and limitation on strategic arms (through the
  strategic arms reduction talks in Geneva or otherwise)--
  (1) should not prevent the United States from deploying a force structure
  under the agreement which emphasizes survivable strategic systems and,
  in particular, should not in any way compromise the security of the United
  States ballistic-missile carrying submarine force, and
  (2) should not prohibit or limit the deployment of non-nuclear cruise
  missiles.
SEC. 925. AIRBORNE DRUG TRAFFICKERS
  (a) GENERAL AUTHORITY- (1) The purpose of this provision is to authorize
  Federal law enforcement agencies to use appropriate force to compel airborne
  drug traffickers to comply with instructions to land their aircraft.
  (2) Whenever any aircraft liable to seizure or examination (on the grounds
  that narcotics are being transported on the aircraft) by any agency of the
  United States with responsibility for drug law enforcement does not land
  on being ordered to do so on being pursued by an authorized aircraft which
  has displayed identifying insignia prescribed for an authorized aircarft,
  the person in charge or in command of the authorized aircraft may, after
  a gun has been fired by the authorized aircraft as a warning signal,
  fire at or into the aircraft which does not land.
  (b) INDEMNIFICATION- The person in command of an authorized aircraft and
  all persons acting under that person's direction shall be indemnified
  from any penalties or actions for damages for firing at or into any

  person acting pursuant to their orders is prosecuted or arrested therefor,
  they shall be forthwith admitted to bail.
  (c) DEFINITION- For the purposes of this section--
  (1) the term `authorized aircraft' means an aircraft operated by an agency
  of the United States with responsibility for drug law enforcement; and
  (2) the term `agency of the United States with responsibility for drug
  law enforcement' means the Coast Guard and Customs Service and the Drug
  Enforcement Agency.
SEC. 926. RETIREMENT PAY FORFEITURE AND DISQUALIFICATION
  The Judiciary Committee is directed to hold appropriate hearings and
  report back to the Senate by November 1, 1989. The report shall contain
  the following determinations:
  (1) Whether the legislative intent of title 18 United States Code, section
  2071(b) was to require the forfeiture and disqualification from `office
  under the United States' to apply to officers, both active and retired,
  in the Armed Forces;
  (2) Whether the legislative intent of title 18 United States Code, section
  2071(b) was to deprive persons convicted under this section from receipt
  of their Federal pensions;
  (3) Whether title 18 United States Code, section 2071(b) applies to other
  retired government employees, and if not, whether such is equitable;
  (4) Whether action on any remedial legislation for Lieutenant Colonel Oliver
  North, relating to the denial of his pension as a result of his conviction
  under title 18 United States Code, section 2071(b) is appropriate in lieu
  of litigation, or whether it is preferable for this issue to be determined
  in the courts;
  (5) Whether remedial legislation for Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North is
  warranted under the application of title 18 United States Code, section
  2071(b) considering the opinion of the General Counsel of the General

SEC. 927. FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS UNDER THE ANTI-DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1988
  (a) TRANSFER OF AUTHORIZATION- Of the unobligated funds available to all
  departments and agencies of the Executive branch of the Government at the

  year 1989 bears to the total amount of unobligated funds of all departments
  and agencies of the Executive branch at the end of such fiscal year from
  funds appropriated for defense and nondefense discretionary programs.
SEC. 928. REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAM
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) Military professionals in many developing countries would benefit from
  training which enhances their ability both to engage in militarily valuable
  activities and to contribute to nation-building in their countries, including
  training in such matters as engineering, communications, electronics,
  maintenance, health care, logistics, management, and military jurisprudence.
  (2) Such training of military professionals of developing countries could
  be coordinated in such a way as to contribute to the total economic and
  social development of those countries.
  (3) The technical activities of the Army Corps of Engineers and the medical
  departments of the Armed Forces throughout the history of the United
  States are examples of the use of military skills and personnel to build,
  and otherwise to benefit, a nation in nonmilitary ways.
  (b) REPORT REQUIREMENT- (1) The Comptroller General of the United States
  shall prepare a report on the International Military Education and Training
  (IMET) Program. The report shall contain the following:
  (A) A tabulation of the number of students from countries around the world
  who are currently participating in training under the program.
  (B) A description of the content of the courses currently offered military
  personnel enrolled in the IMET program.
  (C) A discussion of the feasibility of refocusing IMET activities to include
  training in nation-building skills such as engineering, communications,
  electronics, maintenance, health care, logistics, management, and military
  jurisprudence.
  (D) A discussion of the desirability and feasibility of developing
  cooperative IMET programs involving the Army Corps of Engineers and the
  medical departments of the Armed Forces.
  (2) The Comptroller General shall transmit the report to the Committees
  on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives not later
  than February 1, 1990.
SEC. 929. COOPERATION WITH NNBIS
  (a)(1) The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 terminated the National Narcotics
  Border Interdiction System (NNBIS) and placed it under the auspices of
  the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
  (2) The National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS) provided
  valuable information and support to State and local law enforcement agencies
  involved in drug interdiction activities;
  (b) Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate of the United States that
  the cooperation that existed between State and local law enforcement
  officials and the Federal agencies participating in NNBIS should, to the
  extent possible, be continued and enhanced by the Director of the Office
  of National Drug Control Policy.
SEC. 930. UNITED STATES ONSITE INSPECTORS PROGRAM
  (a) FINDINGS- The Senate recognizes the need for a program designed to
  establish a database of prospective personnel that would be qualified to
  participate in the onsite inspection process since the United States is
  currently engaged in multilateral and bilateral negotiations to reduce
  or eliminate various military weaponry and manpower. Specifically, the
  United States is negotiating reductions on strategic forces, conventional
  armaments and manpower, monitoring regimes for nuclear testing, and the
  complete elimination of chemical weapons.
  (1) Monitoring requirements for these possible treaties will be extensive
  and stressing on United States national technical means. To complement and
  support NTM monitoring requirements the United States and Soviet Union have
  negotiated and are currently employing onsite inspection procedures for
  the INF Treaty. Similar onsite inspection provisions are being negotiated
  for possible future treaties and agreements.
  (2) The administration, and many in Congress, consider onsite inspection
  procedures to be an integral part of any future arms control treaty.
  (3) During initial implementation of INF Treaty provisions, the United
  States was not fully prepared for the manpower requirements necessary
  to conduct onsite inspections. The Director of Central Intelligence has
  stated that onsite inspection requirements for any Strategic Arms Reduction
  Treaty (START) will be far more extensive than the INF Treaty. Estimates
  of possible START onsite locations are approximately two thousand five
  hundred as opposed to one hundred twenty for the INF Treaty.
  (4) Personnel requirements will be extensive, in terms of both numbers and
  technical and linguistic skills. Since INF Treaty verification requirements
  are already taxing current personnel resources, START and other requirements
  may quickly exceed the numbers of verification personnel with requisite
  technical and language skills.
  (5) The Department of Defense organization best suited to establish
  such a database is the On-Site Inspection Agency. As an agency of the
  Department of Defense, the OSIA was created to organize and coordinate
  United States Government efforts to monitor the INF Treaty, which includes
  all responsibilities for onsite inspections as required by the terms on
  the Treaty.
  (b) REQUIREMENT- Recognizing these requirements, the On-site Inspection
  Agency shall establish a database of prospective personnel that could
  be called upon to conduct onsite inspections of any future arms control
  agreement that has such provisions as part of the terms of the treaty.
  (1) The database shall be composed of individuals with linguistic and
  technical skills necessary to conduct onsite inspections.
  (2) This database shall consist of active military and other government
  agency personnel and, on a voluntary basis, nongovernment personnel with
  requisite skills to perform duties, on a full-time or part-time basis,
  as prospective onsite inspectors.

  with the Director of Central Intelligence, shall prepare a report for the
  Congress on--
  (1) The onsite monitoring techniques, inspection arrangements, and national

SEC. 937. ALLIED DEFENSE BURDENSHARING IN EUROPE
  (a) Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) Member Nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
  at the initiative of the President, have presented a comprehensive arms
  reductions proposal to the Nations of the Warsaw Pact for consideration
  in the negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) which,
  should the proposal provide the basis for agreement on an eventual CFE
  treaty, would significantly enhance security and stability in Europe and
  the cause of peace worldwide.
  (2) Unilateral reductions in active duty force levels by individual member
  Nations of NATO before the attainment of a CFE agreement would undercut
  NATO's efforts to improve its conventional defense posture, increase
  its reliance on the threat of the early use of nuclear weapons to deter
  aggression, and undermine NATO's arms control negotiating posture in CFE.
  (3) Nevertheless, several member Nations of NATO are considering making
  significant reductions over the next few years in the size of their active
  forces irrespective of developments in the CFE negotiations.
  (4) Despite shifts in relative economic power from the United States to
  some of the major allies of the United States, the costs of mutual defense
  continue to be borne disproportionately by the United States.
  (5) Adjustments in burdensharing are long overdue.
  (6) Unilateral cuts in active duty force levels by member Nations of NATO
  before the successful conclusion of CFE negotiations would exacerbate
  longstanding burdensharing tensions within the alliance.
  (b) BASELINE REPORT- (1) Not later than 60 days after the date of the
  enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the defense
  committees a report showing the following:
  (A) The end strength level of members of the Armed Forces of the United
  States assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of
  NATO for fiscal year 1989.
  (B) The end strength level of allied forces assigned to permanent duty
  ashore in European member nations of NATO for such fiscal year.
  (C) The end strength level of the armed forces of each member nation of
  NATO assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of NATO
  in such fiscal year.
  (D) The ratio (expressed in terms of a percentage) of the end strength
  level referred to in subparagraph (A) to the end strength level referred
  to in subparagraph (B).
  (2) The ratio referred to in paragraph (1)(D) is hereinafter in this
  section referred to as the `baseline ratio'.
  (c) ANNUAL REPORT- The Secretary of Defense shall submit to the defense
  committees not later than April 1 of 1991, 1992, and 1993 a report showing
  the end strength level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States
  assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of NATO and
  the end strength of allied forces assigned to permanent duty ashore in such
  nations in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the report
  is submitted. The Secretary shall include in such report the following:
  (A) Data showing the U.S.-allied forces ratio for such preceding fiscal year.
  (B) A statement indicating whether there has been any change in the
  U.S.-allied forces ratio for such preceding fiscal year compared with the
  U.S-allied forces ratio for the fiscal year immediately before such preceding
  fiscal year and, if so, the amount of such change and an explanation of
  the cause for such change.
  (C) A discussion of any action taken in the fiscal year preceding the
  year in which the report is submitted to encourage the NATO allies (other
  than the United States) to increase the number of allied forces assigned
  to permanent duty ashore in the European member nations of NATO and a
  discussion of the results of such action.
  (d) LIMITATION ON OBLIGATION OF FUNDS- If the Secretary determines on
  the basis of a report referred to in subsection (b) that the U.S.-allied
  forces ratio for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the
  report is submitted is greater than the baseline ratio by more than one
  percentage point--
  (1) the President shall initiate appropriate diplomatic initiatives to
  persuade the NATO allies to increase allied forces assigned to permanent
  duty in European members nations of NATO in sufficient numbers so that
  the U.S.-allied forces ratio no longer exceeds the baseline ratio; and
  (2) funds appropriated to or for the use of the Department of Defense may
  not be obligated or expended to support an end strength level of members of
  the Armed Forces of the United States assigned to permanent duty ashore in
  European member nations of NATO for the fiscal year following the fiscal
  year in which the report is received in any number that would cause the
  U.S-allied forces ratio in such following fiscal year to exceed the baseline
  ratio by more than one percentage point.
  (e) WAIVER AUTHORITY- The President may waive this section if the President
  declares that such action is critical to the national security of the
  United States and immediately notifies Congress of his action and the
  reasons therefor.
  (f) INAPPLICABILITY- This section shall not apply in the event of a
  declaration of war or an armed attack on any NATO member or in the event
  that a comprehensive arms reduction agreement is signed as a result of
  the negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE).
  (g) REPORT COMPLIANCE- The Secretary shall be deemed to have complied
  with the report requirements of subsection (b) in any fiscal year if
  the Secretary includes the information required by such subsection in the
  report submitted in such year to the defense committees pursuant to section
  1002(d) of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 (98 Stat. 2575;
  22 U.S.C. 1928 note).
  (h) END STRENGTH PERMANENT CEILING- Nothing in this section shall be
  construed to permit the obligation or expenditure of funds to support an
  end strength level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States
  assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of NATO at any
  level in excess of the permanent ceiling specified in section 1002(c)(1)
  of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985.
  (i) DEFINITIONS- As used in this section:
  (1) The term `defense committees' means the Committees on Armed Services
  and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of
  Representatives.
  (2) The term `allied forces' means members of the armed forces of member
  nations of NATO serving on active duty, other than the members of the
  Armed Forces of the United States.
  (3) The term `U.S.-allied forces ratio' means, with respect to a fiscal
  year, the ratio (expressed in terms of a percentage) of the end strength
  level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States assigned to
  permanent duty ashore in European member nations of NATO relative to the
  end strength level of allied forces assigned to permanent duty ashore in
  such nations in that fiscal year.
SEC. 938. JAPAN'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SECURITY
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) Extraordinary political, economic, and social changes have occurred
  in Japan since World War II.
  (2) As a result of such changes, Japan is capable of assuming increased
  responsibility for its own security.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
  (1) in view of the changes referred to in subsection (a), Japan should
  assume increased responsibility for its own security;
  (2) Japan should offset the direct costs incurred by the United States in
  deploying military forces for the defense of Japan;
  (3) Japan should assume a more significant security role consistent with
  its economic status by taking the following actions:
  (A) Increase expenditures for its Official Development Assistance program
  and its defense programs so that, by 1992, the level of spending by Japan
  on those programs (stated as a percentage of gross national product) will
  approximate the average of the levels of spending by the member nations
  of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on official development
  assistance and defense programs (stated as a percentage of their respective
  gross national products).
  (B) Devote any increase in its spending for such Official Development
  Assistance program primarily to the Republic of the Philippines and to
  countries in regions of importance to global stability outside of East
  Asia, particularly to countries in Latin America, the Caribbean area,
  and the Mediterranean area.
  (C) Devote any increase in spending for that program primarily to untied
  grants and increasing the portion of total expenditures made in that program
  for those multilateral financial institutions of which Japan is a member.
  (D) Designate those nations that are to be recipients of increased
  development assistance referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (C) after
  consultation with Japan's security partners.
  (E) In consultation with the United States, complete its 5-year defense
  program for fiscal years 1986 through 1990 and, at the earliest possible
  date after the completion of that program, fulfill the pledge of Prime
  Minister Suzuki to defend the territory, airspace, and sea lanes of Japan
  to a distance of 1,000 miles.
  (F) Acquire `off-the-shelf' military equipment from the United States
  (including completely equipped, long-range early warning aircraft, additional
  AEGIS weapon systems, refueling aircraft, munitions, and spare parts) in
  developing the capabilities called for in Japan's current and subsequent
  5-year defense programs.
  (c) NEGOTIATIONS- At the earliest practicable date after the enactment
  of this Act, the President shall enter into negotiations with Japan for
  the purpose of achieving an agreement under which Japan agrees to make
  contributions sufficient in value to meet the direct cost of deploying
  United States forces for the defense of Japan.
  (d) NOTIFICATION TO CONGRESS- In order that Congress may determine whether
  further action is appropriate, the President shall submit to Congress an
  initial report, not later than April 1, 1990, on the status and results of
  the negotiations referred to in subsection (a) and shall submit a second
  report, not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act,
  on the status and results of such negotiations.
SEC. 939. REPORT ON COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEAS DEPENDENTS
  (a) REPORT- The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a study of practicable
  options available to the Department of Defense to reduce costs associated
  with maintaining overseas large numbers of dependents of members of the
  Armed Forces of the United States and dependents of civilian employees
  of the Department of Defense. In carrying out such study the Secretary
  shall consider such options and combinations of options as the Secretary
  considers feasible to achieve a reduction in such costs. The Secretary
  shall specifically address, at a minimum, the following questions:
  (1) Would expansion of incentives for unaccompanied tours of duty overseas
  be effective in reducing the number of such tours and would such an increase
  in incentives be cost effective?
  (2) Would more frequent rotation of overseas personnel without dependents
  result in overall savings?
  (3) Would an increase in the use of local contractors at overseas stations
  to provide services currently being provided by Department of Defense
  personnel result in overall savings to the United States and, if so, what
  would the cost implications be for United States families at such stations?
  (4) What costs associated with the support of overseas dependents would
  likely result from a reduction in personnel under a conventional forces
  in Europe (CFE) agreement?
  (5) Would the granting of fewer exceptions to the length of overseas duty
  tours reduce permanent change of station costs?
  (6) To what extent can overseas facilities be consolidated and centralized
  to reduce administrative and overhead costs?
  (7) To what extent can reductions in family support services at overseas
  stations be made without materially affecting the standard of living of
  the personnel assigned to duty at such stations?
  (8) Would reductions in overseas family support costs likely result in
  increased costs in programs in the United States?
  (9) To what extent would dependents be likely to accompany members of
  the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the Department of Defense to
  overseas stations in the absence of each of the various types of special
  assistance and benefits currently provided to overseas dependents?
  (10) How would reduction or termination of the various types of the special
  assistance and benefits for overseas dependents affect combat readiness,
  morale, and retention?
  (b) SUBMISSION OF REPORT- The Secretary shall submit the report required
  by subsection (a) to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and
  the House of Representatives not later than February 1, 1990, together
  with such comments and recommendations for legislation as the Secretary
  considers appropriate.
SEC. 940. UNITED STATES-REPUBLIC OF KOREA SECURITY RELATIONSHIP
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) Since the Korean conflict, the Republic of Korea has made tremendous
  progress in rebuilding its economic and military strength.
  (2) The alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea has
  contributed greatly to the security of both countries.
  (3) The Republic of Korea has dedicated a large share of its national
  resources to its security, as manifested by defense expenditures which
  comprise approximately one-third of its national budget.
  (4) The United States has contributed a large amount of its national
  resources, including approximately 46,000 military personnel, to protecting
  the security interests that it shares with the Republic of Korea.
  (5) In accordance with its obligations under the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty
  with the Republic of Korea, the United States remains committed to the
  security and territorial integrity of the Republic of Korea.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS AND REPORT REQUIREMENT- (1) It is the sense of
  Congress that--
  (A) the United States should reassess the missions, force structure,
  and locations of its military forces in the Republic of Korea and East Asia;
  (B) the Republic of Korea should assume increased responsibility for its
  own security;
  (C) the Republic of Korea should offset more of the direct costs incurred
  by the United States in deploying military forces for the defense of the
  Republic of Korea; and
  (D) the United States and the Republic of Korea should consult on the
  feasibility and desirability of partial, gradual reductions of United
  States military forces in the Republic of Korea.
  (2) In order that Congress may determine whether further action is
  appropriate, the President shall submit to Congress an initial report, not
  later than April 1, 1990, on the status and results of the consultations
  referred to in paragraph (1)(D) and shall submit a second report, not
  later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, on the
  status and results of such consultations.
  (c) REPORT- (1) Not later than April 1, 1990, the President shall submit
  to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of
  Representatives a report on the military presence of the United States
  in the Republic of Korea and in East Asia. The President shall include
  in such report a strategic plan relating to the continued United States
  military presence in the Republic of Korea and East Asia. The President
  shall specifically include in the report the following:
  (A) An assessment of the implications of recent developments in the Soviet
  Union and the People's Republic of China for United States and allied
  security planning in East Asia.
  (B) Identification of those changes in the missions, force structure, and
  locations of United States forces in East Asia that would strengthen the
  capabilities of such forces and lower the costs of maintaining such forces.
  (C) A discussion of ways in which increased defense responsibilities and
  costs presently borne by the United States can be transferred to the allies
  of the United States in East Asia.
  (D) Identification of the additional actions that the Republic of Korea
  can take to contribute more to its own security.
  (E) A discussion of the feasibility of restructuring United States military
  forces stationed in Okinawa with the objective of improving civil-military

  (F) A discussion of the status and prospects of negotiations between the
  United States and the Republic of the Philippines on the continued use of
  United States military installations in the Republic of the Philippines.
  (G) An assessment of whether a requirement still exists for a regional
  security role for United States forces stationed in the Republic of Korea.
  (2) The President shall also include in the report a five-year plan
  with respect to the United States military presence in the Republic of
  Korea. The President shall specifically include in the plan a discussion
  of the feasibility and desirability of the following:
  (A) Restructuring United States military forces in the Republic of Korea
  with the objective of changing the role of such forces from a leading role
  in deterring aggression to a supporting role.
  (B) Partial, gradual reductions in the number of United States military
  personnel stationed in the Republic of Korea.
  (C) Larger offsets by the Republic of Korea for the direct costs incurred
  by the United States in deploying military forces in defense of the Republic
  of Korea.
  (D) The redeployment of United States military personnel and facilities
  within the Republic of Korea that can be made to reduce friction between
  such personnel and the people of the Republic of Korea.
  (E) Changes in the United Nations and United States-Republic of Korea
  bilateral command arrangements that would facilitate a transfer of certain
  military missions and command to the Republic of Korea.
  (F) Confidence-building measures that could be promoted in northeast Asia
  to lessen tensions in the region.
  (G) Additional actions the Republic of Korea could take to assume more
  responsibility for its security.
SEC. 941. POLICY REAFFIRMING UNITED STATES/SOVIET EQUALITY IN STRATEGIC FORCES
  It is the sense of the Senate that--
  (1) the President should seek a START treaty that, inter alia, would not
  limit the United States to levels of intercontinental strategic forces
  inferior to the limits provided for the Soviet Union;
  (2) the success of the President's efforts to attain such a treaty is
  dependent upon the maintenance of a vigorous research and development and
  modernization program as required by a prudent strategic posture; and
  (3) no action should be taken under this or any other Act that will obligate
  the United States to disarm or to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or
  armaments of the United States, except pursuant to the treatymaking power
  of the President under the Constitution or unless authorized by further
  affirmative legislation by the Congress of the United States.
SEC. 942. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROCUREMENT OF B-2 AIRCRAFT
  (a) FINDINGS- The Senate makes the following findings:
  (1) Over the past several decades, the United States has devoted substantial
  resources to the strategic bomber force, including significant upgrades
  to B-52 bombers, and the research, development, and procurement of B-1
  bombers and air-launched cruise missiles.
  (2) The Department of Defense currently estimates that the acquisition
  cost for a force of one hundred and thirty-two B-2 aircraft will be
  $70,200,000,000 (then-year dollars), and this estimate is premised on
  several assumptions, including the achievement of cost-reduction initiatives,
  not all of which have been contracted for yet.
  (3) The lifecycle costs for a force of one hundred and thirty-two B-2
  aircraft would be significantly higher than this acquisition cost estimate
  of $70,200,000,000 (then-year dollars).
  (4) The Congress has approved funds for the low rate initial production
  of eleven B-2 aircraft through fiscal year 1990, but has not decided how
  many B-2 aircraft should be produced in total.
  (5) If the Congress makes a decision not to acquire a large number of B-2
  aircraft, the funds available for other military programs could be increased.
  (6) Fiscal year 1990 will constitute the fifth consecutive year of real
  decline in the amount appropriated for budget function 050 (National
  Security).
  (7) The constraints on future defense budgets make it essential that the
  Nation's defense priorities be carefully analyzed so as to properly fund
  the Armed Forces, including the various elements of the Nation's strategic
  forces.
  (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE- In light of the findings in subsection (a),
  it is the sense of the Senate that:
  (1) It is not prudent or possible at this time to commit to the production
  of B-2 aircraft other than under the low-rate initial production plan.
  (2) The contingent authorization of funds in this Act for the low-rate
  initial production of three additional B-2 aircraft does not constitute
  a commitment to support the procurement of large numbers of B-2 aircraft,
  to provide funding in subsequent years for rate production of B-2 aircraft,
  or to approve a multiyear procurement of B-2 aircraft.
  (3) Prior to a commitment to rate production of B-2 aircraft, the President
  and the Congress should carefully consider the feasibility and desirability,
  both under a START regime that uses the Reykjavik counting rule or an
  alternative counting rule for members and in the absence of a START
  treaty, of--
  (A) structuring the strategic bomber force in such a manner that primary
  reliance would be placed upon bombers carrying cruise missiles rather than
  bombers having strictly a penetrating role; and
  (B) pursuing options for the procurement of significantly fewer than one
  hundred and thirty-two B-2 aircraft, in the event that a decision is made
  in the future to procure an operational force of B-2 aircraft, in order
  to reduce the total acquisition and lifecycle cost of the B-2 program.
SEC. 943. AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN IRAN
  It is the Sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense and Director
  of Central Intelligence shall report by September 1, 1989, to the Senate
  Committee on Armed Services, the House Committee on Armed Services, the
  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select
  Committee on Intelligence on efforts to locate American hostages in Lebanon,
  the resources dedicated to locating these hostages and how additional
  resources, in terms of funds and personnel, can be effectively utilized
  to locate these hostages and obtain their release.
SEC. 944. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PRESIDENTIAL SUPPORT FOR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT
OF THE V-22 OSPREY PROGRAM
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft design is on the leading edge of aerospace
  technology for short take-off and landing capability.
  (2) The V-22 aircraft has the potential of simultaneously conducting
  helicopter missions farther, faster, and with a larger payload than any
  rotor-wing aircraft.
  (3) The United States Marine Corps has a high priority to modernize its
  aging CH-46 helicopter fleet.
  (4) The V-22 aircraft may be well suited for use by the Special Operations
  Forces of the Armed Forces.
  (5) The V-22 aircraft may have substantial potential for facilitating the
  accomplishment of essential Army, Navy, and Air Force missions.
  (6) There is substantial potential for the technology used in the development
