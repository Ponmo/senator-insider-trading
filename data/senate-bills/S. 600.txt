TITLE XXIV—GLOBAL PATHOGEN SURVEILLANCE
SEC. 2401. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the “Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2005”.
SEC. 2402. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to the United States. The insidious nature of the threat, the likely delayed recognition in the event of an attack, and the underpreparedness of the domestic public health infrastructure may produce catastrophic consequences following a biological weapons attack upon the United States.
(2) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon and developed, tested, produced, or released in another country can quickly spread to the United States. Given the realities of international travel, trade, and migration patterns, a dangerous pathogen released anywhere in the world can spread to United States territory in a matter of days, before any effective quarantine or isolation measures can be implemented.
(3) To effectively combat bioterrorism and ensure that the United States is fully prepared to prevent, diagnose, and contain a biological weapons attack, measures to strengthen the domestic public health infrastructure and improve domestic surveillance and monitoring, while absolutely essential, are not sufficient.
(4) The United States should enhance cooperation with the World Health Organization, regional health organizations, and individual countries, including data sharing with appropriate United States departments and agencies, to help detect and quickly contain infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorism agents before they can spread.
(5) The World Health Organization (WHO) has done an impressive job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks around the world, including the recent emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response network.
(6) The capabilities of the World Health Organization are inherently limited by the quality of the data and information it receives from member countries, the narrow range of diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) upon which its disease surveillance and monitoring is based, and the consensus process it uses to add new diseases to the list. Developing countries in particular often cannot devote the necessary resources to build and maintain public health infrastructures.
(7) In particular, developing countries could benefit from—
(A) better trained public health professionals and epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;
(B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of pathogens;
(C) disease reporting based on symptoms and signs (known as “syndrome surveillance”), affording the earliest possible opportunity to conduct an effective response;
(D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in syndrome surveillance capabilities and real-time information dissemination to public health officials; and
(E) appropriate communications equipment and information technology to efficiently transmit information and data within national and regional health networks, including inexpensive, Internet-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and relevant telephone-based systems for early recognition and diagnosis of diseases.
(8) The United States is working with states of the former Soviet Union to monitor disease outbreaks in that region, and it has begun a program under the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission to work with the Secretariat of Health of the government of Mexico and the States of Mexico that border the United States by providing, among other forms of assistance, assistance of the kind provided for in this title. What is needed now is an effort to improve pathogen surveillance worldwide.
(9) An effective international capability to monitor and quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks will offer dividends not only in the event of biological weapons development, testing, production, and attack, but also in the more likely cases of naturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks that could threaten the United States. Furthermore, a robust surveillance system will serve to deter terrorist use of biological weapons, as early detection will help mitigate the intended effects of such malevolent uses.
(b) Purpose.—The purposes of this title are as follows:
(1) To enhance the capability and cooperation of the international community, including the World Health Organization and individual countries, through enhanced pathogen surveillance and appropriate data sharing, to detect, identify, and contain infectious disease outbreaks, whether the cause of those outbreaks is intentional human action or natural in origin.
(2) To enhance the training of public health professionals and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in advanced Internet-based and other electronic syndrome surveillance systems, in addition to traditional epidemiology methods, so that they may better detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease outbreaks, especially those due to pathogens most likely to be used in a biological weapons attack.
(3) To provide assistance to developing countries to purchase appropriate public health laboratory equipment necessary for infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis.
(4) To provide assistance to developing countries to purchase appropriate communications equipment and information technology, including, as appropriate, relevant computer equipment, Internet connectivity mechanisms, and telephone-based applications to effectively gather, analyze, and transmit public health information for infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis.
(5) To make available greater numbers of United States Government public health professionals to international health organizations, regional health networks, and United States diplomatic missions where appropriate.
(6) To establish “lab-to-lab” cooperative relationships between United States public health laboratories and established foreign counterparts.
(7) To expand the training and outreach activities of overseas United States laboratories, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense entities, to enhance the disease surveillance capabilities of developing countries.
(8) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing regional health networks and, where appropriate, seed money for new regional networks.

TITLE XXVI—SAFE WATER
SEC. 2601. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the “Safe Water: Currency for Peace Act of 2005”.
SEC. 2602. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Water-related diseases are a human tragedy, killing and debilitating millions of people annually, preventing millions of people from leading healthy lives, and undermining development efforts.
(2) Providing safe supplies of water, and sanitation and hygiene improvements would save millions of lives by reducing the prevalence of water-borne diseases, water-based diseases, water-privation diseases, and water-related vector diseases.
(3) An estimated 1,800,000 people die of diarrhoeal diseases every year. Ninety percent of these people are children under the age of five who live in developing countries. Simple household and personal hygiene measures, such as household water treatment and safe storage and effective hand washing with soap, reduce the burden of diarrhoeal disease by more than 40 percent.
(4) According to the World Health Organization, 88 percent of diarrhoeal disease can be attributed to unsafe water supply, and inadequate sanitation and hygiene.
(5) Around the world, more than 150,000,000 people are threatened by blindness caused by trachoma, a disease that is spread through poor hygiene and sanitation, and aggravated by inadequate water supply.
(6) Chronic intestinal helminth infections are a leading source of global morbidity, including cognitive impairment and anemia for hundred of millions of children and adults. Access to safe water and sanitation and better hygiene practices can greatly reduce the number of these infections.
(7) Schistosomiasis is a disease that affects 200,000,000 people, 20,000,000 of whom suffer serious consequences, including liver and intestinal damage. Improved water resource management to reduce infestation of surface water, improved sanitation and hygiene, and deworming treatment can dramatically reduce this burden.
(8) In 2002, 2,600,000,000 people lacked access to improved sanitation. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 36 percent of the population has access to improved sanitation. In developing countries, only 31 percent of the population in rural areas has access to improved sanitation.
(9) Improved management of water resources can contribute to comprehensive strategies for controlling mosquito populations associated with life-threatening vector-borne diseases in developing countries, especially malaria, which kills more than 1,000,000 people each year, most of whom are children.
(10) Natural disasters such as floods and droughts threaten people's health. Floods contaminate drinking-water systems with industrial waste refuse, sewage, and human and animal excreta. Droughts exacerbate malnutrition and limit access to drinking water supplies. Sound water resource management can mitigate the impact of such natural disasters.
(11) The United Nations Population Fund report entitled “Water: A Critical Resource” stated that “Nearly 500 million people [suffer from] water stress or serious water scarcity. Under current trends, two-thirds of the world's population may be subject to moderate to high water stress by 2025”. Effective water management and equitable allocation of scarce water supplies for all uses will become increasingly important for meeting both human and ecosystem water needs in the future.
(12) The participants in the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002, agreed to the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development which included an agreement to work to reduce by one-half “the proportion of people who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water,” and “the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation” by 2015.
(13) At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, building on the U.S.-Japan Partnership for Security and Prosperity announced in June 2001 by President Bush and Prime Minister Koizumi, the United States and Japan announced a Clean Water for People Initiative to cooperate in providing safe water and sanitation to the world's poor, improve watershed management, and increase the productivity of water.
(14) At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the United States announced the Water for the Poor Initiative which committed the United States to provide $750,000,000 over 3 years to increase access to safe water and sanitation services, improve watershed management, and increase the productivity of water. During fiscal year 2004, the United States provided an estimated $472,000,000 in assistance to the Water for the Poor Initiative, including funds made available for reconstruction activities in Iraq, of which $388,000,000 was made available for safe drinking water and sanitation programs.
(15) During fiscal year 2004, the United States provided $49,000,000 in assistance for activities to provide safe drinking water and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa, an amount that is equal to 6.5 percent of total United States foreign assistance provided for all water activities in the Water for the Poor Initiative.
(16) At the 2003 Summit of the Group of Eight in Evian, France, the members of the Group of Eight produced a plan entitled “Water: A G8 Action Plan” that stated that a lack of water can undermine human security. The Action Plan committed the members of the Group of Eight to playing a more active role in international efforts to provide safe water and sanitation to the world's poor by mobilizing domestic resources in developing countries for water infrastructure financing through the development and strengthening of local capital markets and financial institutions, particularly by establishing, where appropriate, at the national and local levels, revolving funds that offer local currency financings, which allow communities to finance capital-intensive water infrastructure projects over an affordable period of time at competitive rates.
(17) The G8 Action Plan also committed members of the Group of Eight to provide risk mitigation mechanisms for such revolving funds and to provide technical assistance for the development of efficient local financial markets and building municipal government capacity to design and implement financially viable projects and provide, as appropriate, targeted subsidies for the poorest communities that cannot fully service market rate debt.
(18) The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/217 of February 9, 2004, proclaimed “the period from 2005 to 2015 the International Decade for Action, ‘Water for Life’, to commence on World Water Day, 22 March 2005” for the purpose of increasing the focus of the international community on water-related issues at all levels and on the implementation of water-related programs and projects.
SEC. 2603. WATER FOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
(a) In General.—Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 104C the following new section:
“SEC. 104D. WATER FOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
“(a) Finding.—Congress makes the following findings:
“(1) Access to safe water and sanitation and improved hygiene are significant factors in controlling the spread of disease in the developing world and positively affecting economic development.
“(2) The health of children and other vulnerable rural and urban populations in developing countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, is threatened by a lack of adequate safe water, sanitation, and hygiene.
“(3) Efforts to meet United States foreign assistance objectives, including those related to agriculture, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the environment will be advanced by improving access to safe water and sanitation and promoting sound water management throughout the world.
“(4) Developing sustainable financing mechanisms, including private sector financing, is critical to the long-term sustainability of improved water supply, sanitation, and hygiene.
“(5) The annual level of investment needed to meet the water and sanitation needs of developing countries far exceeds the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and spending by governments of developing countries, so attracting greater public and private investment is essential.
“(6) Long-term sustainability in the provision of access to safe water and sanitation and in the maintenance of water and sanitation facilities requires a legal and regulatory environment conducive to private sector investment and private sector participation in the delivery of water and sanitation services.
“(7) The absence of robust domestic financial markets and sources for long-term financing are a major impediment to the development of water and sanitation projects in developing countries.
“(8) At the 2003 Summit of the Group of Eight in Evian, France, the members of the Group of Eight produced a plan entitled ‘Water: A G8 Action Plan’ that contemplated the promotion of domestic revolving funds to provide local currency financing for capital-intensive water infrastructure projects. Innovative financing mechanisms such as revolving funds and pooled-financings have been very effective vehicles for mobilizing domestic savings for investments in water and sanitation both in the United States and in some developing countries. These mechanisms can serve as a catalyst for greater investment in water and sanitation projects by villages, small towns, and municipalities.
“(9) The G8 Action Plan also committed members of the Group of Eight to improving coordination and cooperation between donors, and such improved coordination and cooperation is essential for enlarging the beneficial impact of donor initiatives.
“(b) Policy.—It is a major objective of United States foreign assistance—
“(1) to promote good health and economic development by providing assistance to expand access to safe water and sanitation, promote sound water management, and improve hygiene for people around the world; and
“(2) to promote, to the maximum extent practicable and appropriate, long-term sustainability in the provision of access to safe water and sanitation by encouraging private investment in water and sanitation infrastructure and services.
“(c) Authorization.—
“(1) IN GENERAL.—To carry out the policy set out in subsection (b), the President is authorized to furnish assistance, including health information and education, to advance good health and promote economic development by improving the safety of water supplies, expanding access to safe water and sanitation, promoting sound water management, and promoting better hygiene.

SEC. 2703. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The nature of war has changed dramatically in recent decades, putting civilians, especially women and children, at greater risk of death, disease, displacement, and exploitation.
(2) In the last decade alone, more than 2,000,000 children have been killed during wars, while more than 4,000,000 have survived physical mutilation, and more than 1,000,000 have been orphaned or separated from their families as a result of war.
(3) The use of rape, particularly against women and girls, is an increasingly common tactic in modern war.
(4) Civilians, particularly women and children, account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by humanitarian emergencies, including as refugees and internally displaced persons, and increasingly are targeted by combatants and armed elements for murder, abduction, forced military conscription, involuntary servitude, displacement, sexual abuse and slavery, mutilation, and loss of freedom.
(5) Large-scale natural disasters, such as the tsunami that struck South East Asia, South Asia, and East Africa on December 26, 2004, and claimed over 200,000 lives, are particularly threatening to children, who are often orphaned or separated from their families.
(6) Traditionally, the response to such humanitarian emergencies has focused on providing food, medical care, and shelter needs, and has placed less emphasis on the safety and security of those affected by a humanitarian emergency.
(7) Refugee women and girls face particular threats because of power inequities, including being forced to exchange sex for food and humanitarian supplies, and being at increased risk of rape and sexual exploitation and abuse due to poor security in refugee camps.
(8) In some circumstances, humanitarian agencies have failed to make individuals affected by a humanitarian emergency, especially women and children, aware of their rights to protection and assistance, to give them access to effective channels of redress, and to make humanitarian workers aware of their duty to respect these rights and provide adequate assistance.
(9) Refugee and displaced women face heightened risks of developing complications during pregnancy, suffering a miscarriage, dying, being injured during childbirth, becoming infected with HIV or another sexually transmitted infection, or suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.
(10) Despite the heightened risks for women during a humanitarian emergency, women's needs for specialized health services have often been overlooked by donors and relief organizations, which are focused on providing food, water, and shelter.
(11) There is a substantial need for the protection of civilians, especially women and children, to be given a high priority during all humanitarian emergencies.
