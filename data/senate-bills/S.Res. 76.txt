IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
March 7 (legislative day, FEBRUARY 6), 1991
Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. PACKWOOD, Mr. COATS, Mr. DIXON, Mr. KERREY,
Mr. AKAKA, Mr. DURENBERGER, Mr. DECONCINI, and Mr. CRAIG) submitted the
following resolution; which was ordered held at the desk
RESOLUTION
To encourage the President of the United States to confer with the sovereign
state of Kuwait, countries of the coalition or the United Nations to establish
an International Criminal Court or an International Military Tribunal to try
and punish all individuals, including President Saddam Hussein, involved in
the planning or execution of crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes
against humanity as defined under international law.
Whereas the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held the initiation
of a war of aggression to be `not only an international crime (but also)
the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that
it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole';
Whereas on August 2, 1990, and without provocation, Iraq initiated a war of
aggression against the sovereign state of Kuwait;
Whereas the charter of the United Nations imposes on its members the
obligations to `refrain in their international relations from the threat or
use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of
any state' and to `settle their international disputes by peaceful means';
Whereas the leaders of the Government of Iraq, a country which is a member of
the United Nations, did violate this provision of the United Nations Charter;
Whereas the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons
in Time of War (the Fourth Geneva Convention) imposes certain obligations
upon a belligerent state, occupying another country by force of arms, in
order to protect the civilian population of the occupied territory from some
of the ravages of the conflict;
Whereas the public testimony of victims and witnesses has indicated that
Iraqi officials violated article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention by
their inhumane treatment and acts of violence against the Kuwaiti civilian
population, including women;
Whereas the public testimony of victims and witnesses has indicated that
Iraqi officials violated articles 31 and 32 of the Fourth Geneva Convention by
subjecting Kuwaiti civilians to physical coercion, suffering, and extermination
in order to obtain information;
Whereas article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that persons
committing `grave breaches' are to be apprehended and subjected to trial;
Whereas `grave breaches' are defined to include: `willful killing, torture,
or inhuman treatment * * *, willfully causing great suffering or serious
injury to body or health, taking of hostages and extensive destruction and
appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity';
Whereas both Iraq and Kuwait are parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention;
Whereas on several occasions the United Nations Security Council has found
Iraq's treatment of Kuwaiti civilians violative of international law;
Whereas in resolution 665, adopted on August 25, 1990, the United Nations
Security Council deplored `the loss of innocent life stemming from the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait';
Whereas in resolution 670, adopted by the United Nations Security Council on
September 25, 1990, it condemned further `the treatment by Iraqi forces on
Kuwaiti nationals and reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied
to Kuwait';
Whereas in resolution 674, the United Nations Security Council demanded that
Iraq cease mistreating and oppressing Kuwaiti nationals in violation of the
Convention and reminded Iraq that it would be liable for any damage or injury
suffered by Kuwaiti nationals due to Iraq's invasion and illegal occupation;
Whereas the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War
(the Third Geneva or POW Convention) sets forth standards for the treatment
of civilians and incapacitated combatants during times of hostilities;
Whereas Iraq is a party to the POW Convention;
Whereas there is evidence and testimony that Iraq violated articles of the POW
Convention by its physical and psychological abuse of military and civilian
POWs including members of the international press;
Whereas there is evidence and testimony that Iraq violated articles of the
POW Convention by placing POWs in solitary confinement, failing to shelter
POWs against air bombardment and denying POWs contact with the outside world;
Whereas in resolution 667, adopted on September 16, 1990, the Security
Council expressed `outrage' at Iraq's abduction of several persons from
diplomatic premises in violation of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic
and Consular Relations;
Whereas in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Iraq did fire missiles
on Israel with the intent of making it a party to war and with the intent
of killing or injuring innocent civilians;
Whereas Iraq has inflicted grave risk to the health and well-being of innocent
civilians in the region by its willful setting on fire of Kuwaiti oil wells
and its willful spilling of oil into the Persian Gulf, resulting in the mass
pollution of air and water;
Whereas for all of the above incidents, it is not a defense that an
individual in committing such heinous acts acted under orders of higher
government officials (International Military Tribunal (Nuremberg) Judgment
and Sentences, 41 A.J.I.L. 172 (1946) (`That a soldier was ordered to kill
or torture in violation of international law of war has never been recognized
as a defense to such acts of brutality.');
Whereas the Nuremberg tribunal provision which held that `crimes against
international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and
only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of
international law be enforced' is as valid today as it was in 1946;
Whereas a failure to try and punish leaders and other persons for crimes
against international law establishes a dangerous precedent and negatively
impacts the value of deterrence to future illegal act; and
Whereas any Iraqi use of chemical weapons against insurgents inside Iraq
should be considered a war crime and that those responsible should be held
accountable:  Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the President should
  confer with Kuwait, other member nations of the coalition or the United
  Nations to establish an International Criminal Court or an International
  Military Tribunal to try and punish all individuals involved in the planning
  or execution of the above referenced crimes, including Saddam Hussein;
  and be it further
  Resolved, That the President should seek prompt and effective United
  Nations Security Council action to stop the use of chemical weapons and
  to punish those responsible.
