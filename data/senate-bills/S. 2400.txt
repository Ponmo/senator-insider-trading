SEC. 242. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING OF THE ADVANCED 
              SHIPBUILDING ENTERPRISE UNDER THE NATIONAL SHIPBUILDING 
              RESEARCH PROGRAM OF THE NAVY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The budget for fiscal year 2005, as submitted to 
        Congress by the President, provides $10,300,000 for the 
        Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise under the National 
        Shipbuilding Research Program of the Navy.
            (2) The Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise is an innovative 
        program to encourage greater efficiency in the national 
        technology and industrial base.
            (3) The leaders of the United States shipbuilding industry 
        have embraced the Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise as a method 
        for exploring and collaborating on innovation in shipbuilding 
        and ship repair that collectively benefits all components of 
        the industry.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--
            (1) that the Senate--
                    (A) strongly supports the innovative Advanced 
                Shipbuilding Enterprise under the National Shipbuilding 
                Research Program as an enterprise between the Navy and 
                industry that has yielded new processes and techniques 
                that reduce the cost of building and repairing ships in 
                the United States; and
                    (B) is concerned that the future-years defense 
                program of the Department of Defense that was submitted 
                to Congress for fiscal year 2005 does not reflect any 
                funding for the Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise after 
                fiscal year 2005; and
            (2) that the Secretary of Defense should continue to 
        provide in the future-years defense program for funding the 
        Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise at a sustaining level in order 
        to support additional research to further reduce the cost of 
        designing, building, and repairing ships.

SEC. 327. SENSE OF SENATE ON PERCHLORATE CONTAMINATION OF GROUND AND 
              SURFACE WATER.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Because finite water sources in the United States are 
        stretched by regional drought conditions and increasing demand 
        for water supplies, there is increased need for safe and 
        dependable supplies of fresh water for drinking and use for 
        agricultural purposes.
            (2) Perchlorate, a naturally occurring and manmade compound 
        with medical, commercial, and national defense applications, 
        which has been used primarily in military munitions and rocket 
        fuels, has been detected in fresh water sources intended for 
        use as drinking water and water necessary for the production of 
        agricultural commodities.
            (3) If ingested in sufficient concentration and in adequate 
        duration, perchlorate may interfere with thyroid metabolism, 
        and this effect may impair the normal development of the brain 
        in fetuses and newborns.
            (4) The Federal Government has not yet established a 
        drinking water standard for perchlorate.
            (5) The National Academy of Sciences is conducting an 
        assessment of the state of the science regarding the effects on 
        human health of perchlorate ingestion that will aid in 
        understanding the effect of perchlorate exposure on sensitive 
        populations.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) perchlorate has been identified as a contaminant of 
        drinking water sources or in the environment in 34 States and 
        has been used or manufactured in 44 States;
            (2) perchlorate exposure at or above a certain level may 
        adversely affect public health, particularly the health of 
        vulnerable and sensitive populations; and
            (3) the Department of Defense should--
                    (A) work to develop a national plan to remediate 
                perchlorate contamination of the environment resulting 
                from Department's activities to ensure the Department 
                is prepared to respond quickly and appropriately once a 
                drinking water standard is established;
                    (B) in cases in which the Department is already 
                remediating perchlorate contamination, continue that 
                remediation;
                    (C) prior to the development of a drinking water 
                standard for perchlorate, develop a plan to remediate 
                perchlorate contamination in cases in which such 
                contamination from the Department's activities is 
                present in ground or surface water at levels that pose 
                a hazard to human health; and
                    (D) continue the process of evaluating and 
                prioritizing sites without waiting for the development 
                of a Federal standard.

of articles or services may be made under this section only if the 
approval authority described in subsection (f) determines that the 
articles or services are not available from a commercial source located 
in the United States in the required quantity or quality, or within the 
time required.

Limitation.--Amounts expended for depot-level maintenance and repair 
workload by non-Federal personnel at an Army industrial facility shall

SEC. 366. MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES OF THE 
              REMAINS OF DECEASED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES FROM 
              OVERSEAS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense, since 1991, has relied on a 
        policy of no media coverage of the transfers of the remains of 
        members Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany, nor at Dover Air 
        Force Base, Delaware, and the Port Mortuary Facility at Dover 
        Air Force Base, nor at interim stops en route to the point of 
        final destination in the transfer of the remains.
            (2) The principal focus and purpose of the policy is to 
        protect the wishes and the privacy of families of deceased 
        members of the Armed Forces during their time of great loss and 
        grief and to give families and friends of the dead the 
        privilege to decide whether to allow media coverage at the 
        member's duty or home station, at the interment site, or at or 
        in connection with funeral and memorial services.
            (3) In a 1991 legal challenge to the Department of Defense 
        policy, as applied during Operation Desert Storm, the policy 
        was upheld by the United States District Court for the District 
        of Columbia, and on appeal, by the United States Court of 
        Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of JB 
        Pictures, Inc. v. Department of Defense and Donald B. Rice, 
        Secretary of the Air Force on the basis that denying the media 
        the right to view the return of remains at Dover Air Force Base 
        does not violate the first amendment guarantees of freedom of 
        speech and of the press.
            (4) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
        Columbia in that case cited the following two key Government 
        interests that are served by the Department of Defense policy:
                    (A) Reducing the hardship on the families and 
                friends of the war dead, who may feel obligated to 
                travel great distances to attend arrival ceremonies at 
                Dover Air Force Base if such ceremonies were held.
                    (B) Protecting the privacy of families and friends 
                of the dead, who may not want media coverage of the 
                unloading of caskets at Dover Air Force Base.
            (5) The Court also noted, in that case, that the bereaved 
        may be upset at the public display of the caskets of their 
        loved ones and that the policy gives the family the right to 
        grant or deny access to the media at memorial or funeral 
        services at the home base and that the policy is consistent in 
        its concern for families.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense policy regarding no media coverage of the 
transfer of the remains of deceased members of the Armed Forces 
appropriately protects the privacy of the members' families and friends 
of and is consistent with United States constitutional guarantees of 
freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

SEC. 367. TRACKING AND CARE OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO ARE 
              INJURED IN COMBAT.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States place 
        themselves in harm's way in the defense of democratic values 
        and to keep the United States safe.
            (2) This call to duty has resulted in the ultimate 
        sacrifice of members of the Armed Forces of the United States 
        who are killed or critically injured while serving the United 
        States.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--
            (1) to honor the sacrifice of the members of the Armed 
        Forces who have been killed or critically wounded while serving 
        the United States;
            (2) to recognize the heroic efforts of the medical 
        personnel of the Armed Forces in treating wounded military 
        personnel and civilians; and
            (3) to support advanced medical technologies that assist 
        the medical personnel of the Armed Forces in saving lives and 
        reducing disability rates for members of the Armed Forces.
    (c) Policy on Tracking of Wounded From Combat Zones.--(1) Not later 
than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Defense shall--
            (A) prescribe the policy of the Department of Defense for 
        providing timely notification to the next of kin of the status, 
        including health and location, of members of the Armed Forces 
        who are seriously ill or injured in a combat zone; and
            (B) transmit to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
        Senate and House of Representatives a copy of the policy 
        prescribed under subparagraph (A).
    (2) The policy prescribed under paragraph (1) shall ensure respect 
for the expressed desires of individual members of the Armed Forces 
regarding notification of next of kin under the policy, and shall also 
include standards of timeliness for the initial and continuing 
notification of next of kin under the policy.
    (d) Funding for Medical Equipment and Combat Casualty 
Technologies.--(1) The amount authorized to be appropriated by section 
201(4) for research, development, test, and evaluation, Defense-wide 
activities, is hereby increased by $10,000,000, with the amount of the 
increase to be allocated to Program Element PE 0603826D8Z.
    (2) Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(4) 
for research, development, test, and evaluation, Defense-wide 
activities, and allocated to Program Element PE 0603826D8Z, as provided 
by paragraph (1), $10,000,000 may be available for medical equipment 
and combat casualty care technologies.
    (e) Offset.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by section 
421 is hereby reduced by $10,000,000, with the amount of the reduction 
to be derived from excess amounts provided for military personnel of 
the Air Force.

SEC. 575. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING RETURN OF MEMBERS TO ACTIVE 
              DUTY SERVICE UPON REHABILITATION FROM SERVICE-RELATED 
              INJURIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The generation of young men and women currently serving 
        on active duty in the Armed Forces, which history will record 
        as being among the greatest, has shown in remarkable numbers an 
        individual resolve to recover from injuries incurred in such 
        service and to return to active service in the Armed Forces.
            (2) Since September 11, 2001, numerous brave soldiers, 
        sailors, airmen, and Marines have incurred serious combat 
        injuries, including (as of June 2004) approximately 100 members 
        of the Armed Forces who have been fitted with artificial limbs 
        as a result of devastating injuries sustained in combat 
        overseas.
            (3) In cases involving combat-related injuries and other 
        service-related injuries it is possible, as a result of 
        advances in technology and extensive rehabilitative services, 
        to restore to members of the Armed Forces sustaining such 
        injuries the capability to resume the performance of active 
        military service, including, in a few cases, the capability to 
        participate directly in the performance of combat missions.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) members of the Armed Forces who on their own initiative 
        are highly motivated to return to active duty service following 
        rehabilitation from injuries incurred in their service in the 
        Armed Forces, after appropriate medical review should be given 
        the opportunity to present their cases for continuing to serve 
        on active duty in varied military capacities;
            (2) other than appropriate medical review, there should be 
        no barrier in policy or law to such a member having the option 
        to return to military service on active duty; and
            (3) the Secretary of Defense should develop specific 
        protocols that expand options for such members to return to 
        active duty service and to be retrained to perform military 
        missions for which they are fully capable.

Congress finds that the study of the Federal death benefits for 
survivors of deceased members of the Armed Forces under section 647 of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 
108-136; 117 Stat. 1520) has given Congress sufficient insight to 
initiate action to provide for the enhancement of the current set of 
death benefits that are provided under law for the survivors.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense shall expedite the completion and 
submission of the final report, which was due on March 1, 2004, under 
section 647 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2004.
    (3) It is the sense of Congress that the President should promptly 
submit to Congress any recommendation for legislation, together with a 
request for appropriations, that the President determines necessary to 
implement the death benefits enhancements that are recommended in the 
final report under section 647 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2004.
    (b) Increases of Death Gratuity Consistent With Increases of Rates 
of Basic Pay.--Section 1478 of title 10, United States Code, is

        subsection (c)'' before the period at the end of the first 
        sentence; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(c) Effective on the date on which rates of basic pay under 
section 204 of this title are increased under section 1009 of title 37 
or any other provision of law, the amount of the death gratuity 
provided under subsection (a) shall be increased by the same overall 
average percentage of the increase in the rates of basic pay taking 
effect on that date.''.
    (c) Fiscal Year 2005 Actions.--At the same time that the President 
submits to Congress the budget for fiscal year 2006 under section 
1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the President shall submit to 
the appropriate committees of Congress referred to in subsection (g) a 
draft or drafts of legislation to provide enhanced death benefits for 
survivors of deceased members of the uniformed services. The draft 
legislation shall include provisions for the following:
            (1) Revision of the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance

                together with an increase, each fiscal year, by the 
                same overall average percentage increase that takes 
                effect during such fiscal year in the rates of basic 
                pay under section 204 of title 37, United States Code;

                insured members of the uniformed services who elect the 
                maximum coverage, together with an increase in such 
                minimum benefit each fiscal year by the same percentage 
                increase as is described in subparagraph (A).
            (2) An additional set of death benefits for each member of 
        the uniformed services who dies in the line of duty while on 
        active duty that includes, at a minimum, an additional death 
        gratuity in the amount that--
                    (A) in the case of a member not described in 
                subparagraph (B), is equal to the sum of--

                        States Code, if the member had not died and had 
                        continued to serve on active duty for an 
                        additional year; and
                            (ii) the total amount of all allowances and

                        entitled to receive under title 37, United 
                        States Code, over the one-year period beginning 
                        on the member's date of death if the member had 
                        not died and had continued to serve on active 
                        duty for an additional year with the unit to 
                        which the member was assigned or detailed on 
                        such date; and
                    (B) in the case of a member who dies as a result of 
                an injury caused by or incurred while exposed to 
                hostile action (including any hostile fire or explosion 
                and any hostile action from a terrorist source), is 
                equal to twice the amount calculated under subparagraph 
                (A).
            (3) Any other new death benefits or enhancement of existing 
        death benefits that the President recommends.

                under paragraph (3)(B) shall be treated for all

        on the day before the first day of the open enrollment period 
        the person is a participant in the Survivor Benefit Plan at the 
        maximum level, or during the open enrollment period the person 
        increases the level of such participation to the maximum level 
        under subsection (b) of this section, and under that Plan is 
        providing annuity coverage for the person's spouse or a former 
        spouse.
            (3) Limitation on eligibility for certain sbp participants 
        not affected by two-tier annuity computation.--A person is not

        or former spouse beneficiary of that person under the Survivor 
        Benefit Plan is to be computed under section 1451(e) of title 
        10, United States Code. However, such a person may during the 
        open enrollment period waive the right to have that annuity 
        computed under such section 1451(e). Any such election is

received by the Secretary concerned before the end of the open 
enrollment period. Any such election shall be made subject to the same 
conditions, and with the same opportunities for designation of 
beneficiaries and specification of base amount, that apply under the 
Survivor Benefit Plan or the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan, as the 
case may be. A person making an election under subsection (a) to 
provide a reserve-component annuity shall make a designation described 
in section 1448(e) of title 10, United States Code.
    (e) Effective Date for Elections.--Any such election shall be 
effective as of the first day of the first calendar month following the 
month in which the election is received by the Secretary concerned.
    (f) Open Enrollment Period.--The open enrollment period under this 
section shall be the one-year period beginning on October 1, 2005.
    (g) Effect of Death of Person Making Election Within Two Years of 
Making Election.--If a person making an election under this section 
dies before the end of the two-year period beginning on the effective 
date of the election, the election is void and the amount of any 
reduction in retired pay of the person that is attributable to the 
election shall be paid in a lump sum to the person who would have been 
the deceased person's beneficiary under the voided election if the 
deceased person had died after the end of such two-year period.
    (h) Applicability of Certain Provisions of Law.--The provisions of 
sections 1449, 1453, and 1454 of title 10, United States Code, are

requirement or domestic content requirement referred to in subsection 
(b) and thereby authorize the procurement of items that are grown, 
reprocessed, reused, produced, or manufactured--

        Principles with the United States;

        Principles with the United States substantially from components 
        and materials grown, reprocessed, reused, produced, or 
        manufactured in the United States or any foreign country that

            ``(3) in the United States substantially from components 
        and materials grown, reprocessed, reused, produced, or

    ``(c) Applicability.--The authority of the Secretary to waive the 
application of a domestic source or content requirements under 
subsection (a) applies to the procurement of items for which the

requirement or domestic content requirement that is set forth in a law 
enacted after the enactment of this section solely on the basis of the 
later enactment.

`Declaration of Principles' means a written understanding (including 
any Statement of Principles) between the Department of Defense and its 
counterpart in a foreign country signifying a cooperative relationship

              OF THE DEFENSE ACQUISITION AND SUPPORT WORKFORCE.

    (a) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
defense acquisition and support workforce may not be reduced, during 
fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007, below the level of that workforce as

equivalence, except as may be necessary to strengthen the defense 
acquisition and support workforce in higher priority positions in 
accordance with this section.
    (b) Increase and Realignment of Workforce.--(1)(A) During fiscal 
years 2005, 2006, and 2007, the Secretary of Defense shall increase the

    (C) The Secretary of Defense may waive a requirement in 
subparagraph (A) and, subject to subsection (a), employ in the defense 
acquisition and support workforce a lesser number of employees if the 
Secretary determines and certifies to the congressional defense 
committees that the cost of increasing such workforce to the larger 
size as required under that subparagraph would exceed the savings to be 
derived from the additional oversight that would be achieved by having 
a defense acquisition and support workforce of such larger size.
    (2) During fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007, the Secretary of 
Defense may realign any part of the defense acquisition and support 
workforce to support reinvestment in other, higher priority positions

        the responsibilities of those positions.

shall--
            (A) assess the extent to which the Department of Defense

    ``(5)(A) Notwithstanding subsection (d), a function of the 
Department of Defense performed by 10 or more civilian employees may 
not be converted, in whole or in part, to performance by a contractor 
unless the conversion is based on the results of a public-private 
competition process that--
            ``(i) formally compares the cost of civilian employee 
        performance of that function with the costs of performance by a 
        contractor;
            ``(ii) creates an agency tender, including a most efficient

        in the solicitation of offers for performance of the activity 
        or function, the cost of performance of the activity or 
        function by a contractor would be less costly to the Department 
        of Defense by an amount that equals or exceeds the lesser of 
        $10,000,000 or 10 percent of the most efficient organization's 
        personnel-related costs for performance of that activity or 
        function by Federal employees; and

        an offeror to reduce costs for the Department of Defense by not 
        making an employer-sponsored health insurance plan available to 
        the workers who are to be employed in the performance of such 
        function under a contract or by offering to such workers an 
        employer-sponsored health benefits plan that requires the 
        employer to contribute less towards the premium or subscription 
        share than that which is paid by the Department of Defense for 
        health benefits for civilian employees under chapter 89 of 
        title 5.
    ``(B) Any function that is performed by civilian employees of the 
Department of Defense and is proposed to be reengineered, reorganized, 
modernized, upgraded, expanded, or changed in order to become more 
efficient shall not be considered a new requirement for the purpose of

        Secretary of a military department, or head of a Defense 
        Agency;

        determination that national security interests are so 
        compelling as to preclude compliance with the requirement for a 
        public-private competition; and
            ``(iii) a copy of the waiver is published in the Federal 
        Register within 10 working days after the date on which the

required under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 or any 
other provision of law or regulation before the performance of a new 
requirement by Federal Government employees commences, the performance 
by Federal Government employees of work pursuant to subsection (a) 
commences, or the scope of an existing activity performed by Federal 
Government employees is expanded. Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-76 shall be revised to ensure that the heads of all Federal 
agencies give fair consideration to the performance of new requirements 
by Federal Government employees.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense shall, to the maximum extent 
practicable, ensure that Federal Government employees are fairly 
considered for the performance of new requirements, with special 
consideration given to new requirements that include functions that--

              RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

    (a) Authority.--Chapter 631 of title 10, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting after the item relating to section 7205 the 
following new section:
``Sec. 7206. Submarine safety research and development: acceptance of 
              services of NATO naval personnel

SEC. 1056. DRUG ERADICATION EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States engaged in military action against 
        the Taliban-controlled Government of Afghanistan in 2001 in 
        direct response to the Taliban's support and aid to Al Qaeda.
            (2) The military action against the Taliban in Afghanistan 
        was designed, in part, to disrupt the activities of, and 
        financial support for, terrorists.
            (3) A greater percentage of the world's opium supply is now 
        produced in Afghanistan than before the Taliban banned the 
        cultivation or trade of opium.
            (4) In 2004, more than two years after the Taliban was 
        forcefully removed from power, Afghanistan is supplying 
        approximately 75 percent of the world's heroin.
            (5) The estimated value of the opium harvested in 
        Afghanistan in 2003 was $2,300,000,000.
            (6) Some of the profits associated with opium harvested in 
        Afghanistan continue to fund terrorists and terrorist 
        organizations, including Al Qaeda, that seek to attack the 
        United States and United States interests.
            (7) The global war on terror is and should remain our 
        Nation's highest national security priority.
            (8) United States and Coalition counterdrug efforts in 
        Afghanistan have not yet produced significant results.
            (9) There are indications of strong, direct connections 
        between terrorism and drug trafficking.
            (10) The elimination of this funding source is critical to 
        making significant progress in the global war on terror.
            (11) The President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has stated 
        that opium production poses a significant threat to the future 
        of Afghanistan, and has established a plan of action to deal 
        with this threat.
            (12) The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has 
        reported that Afghanistan is at risk of again becoming a failed 
        state if strong actions are not taken against narcotics.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should make the substantial reduction of 
        drug trafficking in Afghanistan a priority in the war on 
        terror;
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should, in coordination with 
        the Secretary of State, work to a greater extent in cooperation 
        with the Government of Afghanistan and international 
        organizations involved in counterdrug activities to assist in 
        providing a secure environment for counterdrug personnel in 
        Afghanistan; and
            (3) because the trafficking of narcotics is known to 
        support terrorist activities and contributes to the instability 
        of the Government of Afghanistan, additional efforts should be 
        made by the Armed Forces of the United States, in conjunction 
        with and in support of coalition forces, to significantly 
        reduce narcotics trafficking in Afghanistan and neighboring 
        countries, with particular focus on those trafficking 
        organizations with the closest links to known terrorist 
        organizations.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
Congress a report that describes--
            (1) progress made towards substantially reducing the poppy 
        cultivation and heroin production capabilities in Afghanistan; 
        and
            (2) the extent to which profits from illegal drug activity 
        in Afghanistan fund terrorist organizations and support groups 
        that seek to undermine the Government of Afghanistan.

SEC. 1057. HUMANE TREATMENT OF DETAINEES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) After World War II, the United States and its allies 
        created a new international legal order based on respect for 
        human rights. One of its fundamental tenets was a universal 
        prohibition on torture and ill treatment.
            (2) On June 26, 2003, the International Day in Support of 
        Victims of Torture, President George W. Bush stated, ``The 
        United States is committed to the world-wide elimination of 
        torture and we are leading this fight by example. I call on all 
        governments to join with the United States and the community of 
        law-abiding nations in prohibiting, investigating, and 
        prosecuting all acts of torture and in undertaking to prevent 
        other cruel and unusual punishment.''.
            (3) The United States is a party to the Geneva Conventions, 
        which prohibit torture, cruel treatment, or outrages upon 
        personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading 
        treatment, during armed conflict.
            (4) The United States is a party to 2 treaties that 
        prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or 
        punishment, as follows:
                    (A) The International Covenant on Civil and 
                Political Rights, done at New York December 16, 1966.
                    (B) The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
                Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at 
                New York December 10, 1984.
            (5) The United States filed reservations to the treaties 
        described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) stating 
        that the United States considers itself bound to prevent 
        ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'' to the 
        extent that phrase means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane 
        treatment or punishment prohibited by the 5th amendment, 8th 
        amendment, or 14th amendment to the Constitution.
            (6) Army Regulation 190-8 entitled ``Enemy Prisoners of 
        War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other 
        Detainees'' provides that ``Inhumane treatment is a serious and 
        punishable violation under international law and the Uniform 
        Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).... All prisoners will receive 
        humane treatment without regard to race, nationality, religion, 
        political opinion, sex, or other criteria. The following acts 
        are prohibited: murder, torture, corporal punishment, 
        mutilation, the taking of hostages, sensory deprivation, 
        collective punishments, execution without trial by proper 
        authority, and all cruel and degrading treatment.... All 
        persons will be respected as human beings. They will be 
        protected against all acts of violence to include rape, forced 
        prostitution, assault and theft, insults, public curiosity, 
        bodily injury, and reprisals of any kind.... This list is not 
        exclusive.''.
            (7) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the 
        Department of the Army states that ``acts of violence or 
        intimidation, including physical or mental torture, threats, 
        insults, or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or an 
        aid to interrogation'' are ``illegal''. Such Manual defines 
        ``infliction of pain through... bondage (other than legitimate 
        use of restraints to prevent escape)'', ``forcing an individual 
        to stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged 
        periods of time'', ``food deprivation'', and ``any form of 
        beating'' as ``physical torture'', defines ``abnormal sleep 
        deprivation'' as ``mental torture'', and prohibits the use of 
        such tactics under any circumstances.
            (8) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the 
        Department of the Army states that ``Use of torture and other 
        illegal methods is a poor technique that yields unreliable 
        results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can 
        induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants 
        to hear. Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel will 
        bring discredit upon the U.S. and its armed forces while 
        undermining domestic and international support for the war 
        effort. It may also place U.S. and allied personnel in enemy 
        hands at a greater risk of abuse by their captors.''.
    (b) Prohibition on Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment.--(1) No person in the custody or under the 
physical control of the United States shall be subject to torture or 
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited 
by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.
    (2) Nothing in this section shall affect the status of any person 
under the Geneva Conventions or whether any person is entitled to the 
protections of the Geneva Conventions.
    (c) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--(1) Not later than 180 
days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
prescribe the rules, regulations, or guidelines necessary to ensure 
compliance with the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) by the members of 
the United States Armed Forces and by any person providing services to 
the Department of Defense on a contract basis.
    (2) The Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense 
committees the rules, regulations, or guidelines prescribed under 
paragraph (1), and any modifications to such rules, regulations, or 
guidelines--
            (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such 
        rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications; and
            (B) in a manner and form that will protect the national 
        security interests of the United States.
    (d) Report to Congress.--(1) The Secretary shall submit, on a 
timely basis and not less than twice each year, a report to Congress on 
the circumstances surrounding any investigation of a possible violation 
of the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) by a member of the Armed Forces 
or by a person providing services to the Department of Defense on a 
contract basis.
    (2) A report required under paragraph (1) shall be submitted in a 
manner and form that--
            (A) will protect the national security interests of the 
        United States; and
            (B) will not prejudice any prosecution of an individual 
        involved in, or responsible for, a violation of the prohibition 
        in subsection (b)(1).
    (e) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or 
        punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment 
        or punishment prohibited by the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, 
        or 14th amendment to the Constitution.
            (2) The term ``Geneva Conventions'' means--
                    (A) the Convention for the Amelioration of the 
                Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in 
                the Field, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);
                    (B) the Convention for the Amelioration of the 
                Condition of the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members

                (6 UST 3217);
                    (C) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of 
                Prisoners of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 
                3316); and
                    (D) the Convention Relative to the Protection of 
                Civilian Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva August

for the steps taken at the G-8 summit at Sea Island, Georgia, on June 
8-10, 2004, to demonstrate continued support for the Global Partnership 
against the Spread of Nuclear Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction 
and to expand the Partnership by welcoming new members and using the 
Partnership to coordinate nonproliferation projects in Libya, Iraq, and 
other countries; and that the President should--
            (1) expand the membership of donor nations to the 
        Partnership;
            (2) insure that Russia remains the primary partner of the

SEC. 1059A. EXCEPTION TO BILATERAL AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFERS 
              OF DEFENSE ITEMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Close defense cooperation between the United States and 
        each of the United Kingdom and Australia requires 
        interoperability among the armed forces of those countries.

    (a) Policy.--(1) It is the policy of the United States to treat all 
foreign persons captured, detained, interned or otherwise held in the 
custody of the United States (hereinafter ``prisoners'') humanely and 
in accordance with standards that the United States would consider 
legal if perpetrated by the enemy against an American prisoner.
            (2) It is the policy of the United States that all 
        officials of the United States are bound both in wartime and in 
        peacetime by the legal prohibition against torture, cruel, 
        inhuman or degrading treatment.
            (3) If there is any doubt as to whether prisoners are 
        entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva Conventions, 
        such prisoners shall enjoy the protections of the Geneva 
        Conventions until such time as their status can be determined 
        pursuant to the procedures authorized by Army Regulation 190-8, 
        Section 1-6.
            (4) It is the policy of the United States to expeditiously 
        prosecute cases of terrorism or other criminal acts alleged to 
        have been committed by prisoners in the custody of the United 
        States Armed Forces at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to avoid 
        the indefinite detention of prisoners, which is contrary to the 
        legal principles and security interests of the United States.
    (b) Reporting.--The Department of Defense shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees:
            (1) A quarterly report providing the number of prisoners 
        who were denied Prisoner of War (POW) status under the Geneva 
        Conventions and the basis for denying POW status to each such 
        prisoner.
            (2) A report setting forth--
                    (A) the proposed schedule for military commissions 
                to be held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and
                    (B) the number of individuals currently held at 
                Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the number of such individuals 
                who are unlikely to face a military commission in the 
                next six months, and the reason(s) for not bringing 
                such individuals before a military commission.
            (3) All International Committee of the Red Cross reports, 
        completed prior to the enactment of this Act, concerning the 
        treatment of prisoners in United States custody at Guantanamo 
        Bay, Cuba, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Such ICRC reports should be 
        provided, in classified form, not later than 15 days after 
        enactment of this Act.
            (4) A report setting forth all prisoner interrogation 
        techniques approved by officials of the United States.
    (c) Annual Training Requirement.--The Department of Defense shall 
certify that all Federal employees and civilian contractors engaged in 
the handling and/or interrogating of prisoners have fulfilled an annual 
training requirement on the laws of war, the Geneva Conventions and the 
obligations of the United States under international humanitarian law.

    (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to develop, 
support, and strengthen international accords and other cooperative 
efforts to curtail the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related 
technologies which could threaten the territory of the United States, 
allies and friends of the United States, and deployed members of the 
Armed Forces of the United States with weapons of mass destruction.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Congress makes the following findings:
            (A) Certain countries are seeking to acquire ballistic 
        missiles and related technologies that could be used to attack 
        the United States or place at risk United States interests, 
        forward-deployed members of the Armed Forces, and allies and 
        friends of the United States.
            (B) Certain countries continue to actively transfer or sell 
        ballistic missile technologies in contravention of standards of 
        behavior established by the United States and allies and 
        friends of the United States.
            (C) The spread of ballistic missiles and related 
        technologies worldwide has been slowed by a combination of 
        national and international export controls, forward-looking 
        diplomacy, and multilateral interdiction activities to restrict 
        the development and transfer of such weapons and technologies.
    (2) It is the sense of Congress that--
            (A) the United States should vigorously pursue foreign 
        policy initiatives aimed at eliminating, reducing, or retarding 
        the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related 
        technologies; and
            (B) the United States and the international community 
        should continue to support and strengthen established 
        international accords and other cooperative efforts, including 
        United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 and the Missile 
        Technology Control Regime, that are designed to eliminate, 
        reduce, or retard the proliferation of ballistic missiles and 
        related technologies.

SEC. 1075. COORDINATION OF USERRA WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 
              1986.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Employers of reservists called up for active duty are 
        required to treat them as if they are on a leave of absence or 
        furlough under the Uniformed Services Employment and 
        Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (in this section referred to as 
        ``USERRA'').
            (2) USERRA does not require employers to pay reservists who 
        are on active duty, but many employers pay the reservists the 
        difference between their military stipends and their regular 
        salaries. Some employers provide this ``differential pay'' for 
        up to 3 years.
            (3) For employee convenience, many of these employers also 
        allow deductions from the differential payments for 
        contributions to employer-provided retirement savings plans.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Internal Revenue Service should, to the extent it is able within its 
authority, provide guidance consistent with the goal of promoting and 
ensuring the validity of voluntary differential pay arrangements, 
benefits payments, and contributions to retirement savings plans 
related thereto.

SEC. 1076. AERIAL FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The National Interagency Fire Center does not possess 
        an adequate number of aircraft for use in aerial firefighting 
        and personnel at the Center rely on military aircraft to 
        provide such firefighting services.
            (2) It is in the national security interest of the United 
        States for the National Interagency Fire Center to purchase 
        aircraft for use in aerial firefighting so that military 
        aircraft used for aerial firefighting may be available for use 
        by the Armed Forces.
    (b) Authority To Purchase Aerial Firefighting Equipment.--(1) The 
Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to purchase 10 aircraft, as 
described in paragraph (2), for the National Interagency Fire Center 
for use in aerial firefighting.

            (A) aircraft that are specifically designed and built for 
        aerial firefighting;

        Administration for use in aerial firefighting; and
            (C) manufactured in a manner that is consistent with the 
        recommendations for aircraft used in aerial firefighting 
        contained in--
                    (i) the Blue Ribbon Panel Report to the Chief of 
                the Forest Service and the Director of the Bureau of

                2004.

SEC. 1077. SENSE OF SENATE ON AMERICAN FORCES RADIO AND TELEVISION 
              SERVICE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) It is the mission of the American Forces Radio and 
        Television Service to provide United States military commanders 
        overseas and at sea with a broadcast media resource to 
        effectively communicate Department of Defense, Service-unique, 
        theater, and local command information to personnel under their 
        commands and to provide United States military members, 
        Department of Defense civilians, and their families stationed 
        outside the continental United States and at sea with the same 
        type and quality of American radio and television news, 
        information, sports, and entertainment that would be available 
        to them if they were in the continental United States.
            (2) Key principles of American Forces Radio and Television 
        Service broadcasting policy, as outlined in Department of 
        Defense Regulation 5120.20R, are to ensure political 
        programming characterized by fairness and balance and to 
        provide a free flow of political programming from United States 
        commercial and public networks without manipulation or 
        censorship of any news content to the men and women of the 
        Armed Forces and their dependents.
            (3) The stated policy of the American Forces Radio and 
        Television Service is to select programming that represents a 
        cross-section of popular American radio and television 
        offerings and to emulate stateside scheduling and programming 
        seen and heard in the United States.
            (4) It is the policy of American Forces Radio and 
        Television Service to select news and public affairs programs 
        for airing that provide balance and diversity from available 
        nationally recognized program sources, including broadcast and 
        cable networks, Headquarters, American Forces Radio and 
        Television Service, the military departments, and other 
        government or public service agencies.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
mission statement and policies of the American Forces Radio and 
Television Service appropriately state the goal of maintaining equal 
opportunity balance with respect to political programming and that the 
Secretary of Defense should therefore ensure that these policies are 
fully being implemented by developing appropriate methods of oversight 
to ensure presentation of all sides of important public questions with 
the fairness and balance envisioned by the Department of Defense 
throughout the American Forces Radio and Television Service system.

SEC. 1078. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AMERICA'S NATIONAL WORLD WAR I MUSEUM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, 
        was built in 1926 in honor of those individuals who served in 
        World War I in defense of liberty and the Nation.
            (2) The Liberty Memorial Association, a nonprofit 
        organization which originally built the Liberty Memorial 
        Museum, is responsible for the finances, operations, and 
        collections management of the Liberty Memorial Museum.
            (3) The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum 
        in the Nation that exists for the exclusive purpose of 
        interpreting the experiences of the United States and its 
        allies in the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the 
        battlefield and on the home front.
            (4) The Liberty Memorial Museum project began after the 
        1918 Armistice through the efforts of a large-scale, grass-
        roots civic and fundraising effort by the citizens and veterans 
        of the Kansas City metropolitan area. After the conclusion of a 
        national architectural design competition, ground was broken in 
        1921, construction began in 1923, and the Liberty Memorial 
        Museum was opened to the public in 1926.
            (5) In 1994, the Liberty Memorial Museum closed for a 
        massive restoration and expansion project. The restored museum 
        reopened to the public on Memorial Day, 2002, during a gala 
        rededication ceremony.
            (6) Exhibits prepared for the original museum buildings 
        presaged the dramatic, underground expansion of core exhibition 
        gallery space, with over 30,000 square feet of new interpretive 
        and educational exhibits currently in development. The new 
        exhibits, along with an expanded research library and archives, 
        will more fully utilize the many thousands of historical 
        objects, books, maps, posters, photographs, diaries, letters, 
        and reminiscences of World War I participants that are 
        preserved for posterity in the Liberty Memorial Museum's 
        collections. The new core exhibition is scheduled to open on 
        Veterans Day, 2006.
            (7) The City of Kansas City, the State of Missouri, and 
        thousands of private donors and philanthropic foundations have 
        contributed millions of dollars to build and later to restore 
        this national treasure. The Liberty Memorial Museum continues 
        to receive the strong support of residents from the States of 
        Missouri and Kansas and across the Nation.
            (8) Since the restoration and rededication of 2002, the 
        Liberty Memorial Museum has attracted thousands of visitors 
        from across the United States and many foreign countries.
            (9) There remains a need to preserve in a museum setting 
        evidence of the honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifice of 
        those Americans who offered their services and who gave their 
        lives in defense of liberty during World War I, evidence of the 
        roles of women and African Americans during World War I, and 
        evidence of other relevant subjects.
            (10) The Liberty Memorial Museum seeks to educate a diverse 
        group of audiences through its comprehensive collection of 
        historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the 
        participants on the battlefield and the home front and the 
        impact of World War I on individuals, then and now. The Liberty 
        Memorial Museum continues to actively acquire and preserve such 
        materials.
            (11) A great opportunity exists to use the invaluable 
        resources of the Liberty Memorial Museum to teach the ``Lessons 
        of Liberty'' to the Nation's schoolchildren through on-site 
        visits, classroom curriculum development, distance learning, 
        and other educational initiatives.
            (12) The Liberty Memorial Museum should always be the 
        Nation's museum of the national experience in the World War I 
        years (1914-1918), where people go to learn about this critical 
        period and where the Nation's history of this monumental 
        struggle will be preserved so that generations of the 21st 
        century may understand the role played by the United States in 
        the preservation and advancement of democracy, freedom, and 
        liberty in the early 20th century.
            (13) This initiative to recognize and preserve the history 
        of the Nation's sacrifices in World War I will take on added 
        significance as the Nation approaches the centennial observance 
        of this event.
            (14) It is fitting and proper to refer to the Liberty 
        Memorial Museum as ``America's National World War I Museum''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, 
        Missouri, including the museum's future and expanded exhibits, 
        collections, library, archives, and educational programs, as 
        ``America's National World War I Museum'';
            (2) recognizes that the continuing collection, 
        preservation, and interpretation of the historical objects and 
        other historical materials held by the Liberty Memorial Museum 
        enhance the knowledge and understanding of the Nation's people 
        of the American and allied experience during the World War I 
        years (1914-1918), both on the battlefield and on the home 
        front;
            (3) commends the ongoing development and visibility of 
        ``Lessons of Liberty'' educational outreach programs for 
        teachers and students throughout the Nation; and
            (4) encourages the need for present generations to 
        understand the magnitude of World War I, how it shaped the 
        Nation, other countries, and later world events, and how the 
        sacrifices made then helped preserve liberty, democracy, and 
        other founding principles for generations to come.

                        sources; and
                            ``(ii) the Secretary shall consider as

                    (A) Radio.--Clear Channel Communications went from 
                owning 43 radio stations prior to 1996 to over 1,200 as 
                of January 2003; Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. was 
                established in 1997 and owned 266 stations as of

                ownership company in the country; and Infinity 
                Broadcasting Corporation went from owning 43 radio 
                stations prior to 1996 to over 185 stations as of June

                38.9 percent in 2004; GE/NBC's national ownership of 
                television stations increased from 24.65 percent prior 
                to 1996 to 33.56 percent in 2004; News Corp./Fox's 
                national ownership of television stations increased 
                from 22.05 percent prior to 1996 to 37.7 percent in 
                2004;
                    (C) Media mergers.--In 2000, Viacom merged with CBS 
                and UPN; in 2002, GE/NBC merged with Telemundo 
                Communications, Inc. and in 2004 with Vivendi Universal 
                Entertainment; in 2003 News Corp./Fox acquired a 
                controlling interest in DirecTV; in 2000, Time Warner, 
                Inc. merged with America Online.
            (2) Over the same period that there has been significant 
        consolidation in the media industry, the number of indecency 
        complaints also has increased dramatically. The largest owners 
        of television and radio broadcast holdings have received the 
        greatest number of indecency complaints and the largest fines, 
        including:
                    (A) Over 80 percent of the fines proposed by the 
                Federal Communications Commission for indecent 
                broadcasts were against stations owned by two of the 
                top three radio companies. The top radio company alone 
                accounts for over two-thirds of the fines proposed by 
                the FCC;
                    (B) Two of the largest fines proposed by the FCC 
                were against two of the top three radio companies;
                    (C) In 2004, the FCC received over 500,000 
                indecency complaints in response to the Superbowl 
                Halftime show aired on CBS and produced by MTV, both of 
                which are owned by Viacom. This is the largest number 
                of complaints ever received by the FCC for a single 
                broadcast;
                    (D) The number of indecency complaints increased 
                from 111 in 2000 to 240,350 in 2003;
            (3) Media conglomerates do not consider or reflect local 
        community standards.
                    (A) The FCC has no record of a television station 
                owned by one of the big four networks (Viacom/CBS, 
                Disney/ABC, News Corp./Fox or GE/NBC) pre-empting 
                national programming for failing to meet community 
                standards;
                    (B) FCC records show that non-network owned 
                stations have often rejected national network 
                programming found to be indecent and offensive to local 
                community standards;
                    (C) A letter from an owned and operated station 
                manager to a viewer stated that programming decisions 
                are made by network headquarters and not the local 
                owned and operated television station management;
                    (D) The Parents Television Council has found that 
                the ``losers'' of network ownership ``are the local 
                communities whose standards of decency are being 
                ignored;''
            (4) The Senate Commerce Committee has found that the 
        current fines do not deter indecent broadcast because they are 
        merely the cost of doing business for large media companies. 
        Therefore, in order to prevent the continued rise of indecency 
        violations, the FCC's authority for indecency fines should be 
        increased and further media consolidation should be prevented.
    (d) Increase in Penalties for Obscene, Indecent, and Profane 
Broadcast.--Section 503(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 
U.S.C. 503(b)(2)) is amended.--
            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as 
        subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively;
            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new 
        subparagraph:
            ``(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the violator 
        is--
                    ``(i)(I) a broadcast station licensee or permittee; 
                or
                    ``(II) an applicant for any broadcast license, 
                permit, certificate, or other instrument or 
                authorization issued by the Commission; and
                    ``(ii) determined by the Commission under paragraph 
                (1) to have broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane 
                language, the amount of any forfeiture penalty 
                determined under this subsection shall not exceed 
                $275,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing 
                violation, except that the amount assessed for any 
                continuing violation shall not exceed a total of 
                $3,000,000 for any single act or failure to act.''; and
            (3) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by paragraph (1), 
        by striking ``subparagraph (A) or (B)'' and inserting 
        ``subparagraph (A), (B), or (C)''.
    (e) New Broadcast Media Ownership Rules Suspended.--
            (1) Suspension.--Subject to the provisions of 
        paragraphs(d)(2), the broadcast media ownership rules adopted 
        by the Federal Communications Commission on June 2, 2003, 
        pursuant to its proceeding on broadcast media ownership rules, 
        Report and Order FCC-03-127, published at 68 FR 46286, August 
        5, 2003, shall be invalid and without legal effect.
            (2) Clarification.--The provisions of paragraph (1) shall 
        not supersede the amendments made by section 629 of the 
        Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2004 (Public Law 
        108-199).
    (f) Additional Factors in Indecency Penalties; Exception.--Section 
503(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)), is 
further amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(F) In the case of a violation in which the violator is 
determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to have uttered 
obscene, indecent, or profane material, the Commission shall take into 
account, in addition to the matters described in subparagraph (E), the 
following factors with respect to the degree of culpability of the 
violator:
            ``(i) Whether the material uttered by the violator was live 
        or recorded, scripted or unscripted.
            ``(ii) Whether the violator had a reasonable opportunity to 
        review recorded or scripted programming or had a reasonable 
        basis to believe live or unscripted programming would contain 
        obscene, indecent, or profane material.
            ``(iii) If the violator originated live or unscripted 
        programming, whether a time delay blocking mechanism was 
        implemented for the programming.
            ``(iv) The size of the viewing or listening audience of the 
        programming.
            ``(v) Whether the obscene incident or profane language was 
        within live programming not produced by the station licensee or 
        permitee.
            ``(vi) The size of the market.
            ``(vii) Whether the violation occurred during a children's 
        television program (as such term is used in the Children's 
        Television Programming Policy referenced in section 73.4050(c) 
        of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 73.4050(c)) or 
        during a television program rated TVY, TVY7, TVY7FV, or TVG 
        under the TV Parental Guidelines as such ratings were approved 
        by the Commission in implementation of section 551 of the 
        Telecommunications Act of 1996, Video Programming Ratings, 
        Report and Order, CS Docket No. 97-55, 13 F.C.C. Rcd. 8232 
        (1998)), and, with respect to a radio broadcast station 
        licensee, permittee, or applicant, whether the target audience 
        was primarily comprised of, or should reasonably have been 
        expected to be primarily comprised of, children.''
    ``(G) The Commission may double the amount of any forfeiture 
penalty (not to exceed $550,000 for the first violation, $750,000 for 
the second violation, and $1,000,000 for the third or any subsequent 
violation not to exceed up to $3,000,000 for all violations in a 24-
hour time period notwithstanding section 503(b)(2)(C)) if the 
Commission determines additional factors are present which are 
aggravating in nature, including--
            ``(i) whether the material uttered by the violator was 
        recorded or scripted;
            ``(ii) whether the violator had a reasonable opportunity to 
        review recorded or scripted programming or had a reasonable 
        basis to believe live or unscripted programming would contain 
        obscene, indecent, or profane material;
            ``(iii) whether the violator failed to block live or 
        unscripted programming;
            ``(iv) whether the size of the viewing or listening 
        audience of the programming was substantially larger than 
        usual, such as a national or international championship 
        sporting event or awards program; and
            ``(v) whether the violation occured during a children's 
        television program (as defined in subparagraph (F) (vii)).''

SEC. 1085. CHILDREN'S PROTECTION FROM VIOLENT PROGRAMMING ACT.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Children's 
Protection from Violent Programming Act''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Television influences children's perception of the 
        values and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.
            (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video 
        programming are--
                    (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of 
                all American children; and
                    (B) readily accessible to all American children.
            (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does 
        indecent programming.
            (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to 
        violent video programming at a young age have a higher tendency 
        to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later in life than 
        those children not so exposed.
            (5) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to 
        violent video programming have a greater tendency to assume 
        that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and therefore to 
        imitate such behavior.
            (6) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to 
        violent video programming have an increased fear of becoming a 
        victim of violence, resulting in increased self-protective 
        behaviors and increased mistrust of others.
            (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting 
        the negative influences of violent video programming on 
        children.
            (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in 
        channeling programming with violent content to periods of the 
        day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial 
        portion of the television audience.
            (9) A significant amount of violent programming that is 
        readily accessible to minors remains unrated specifically for 
        violence and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the basis of 
        its violent content.
            (10) Age-based ratings that do not include content rating 
        for violence do not allow parents to block programming based 
        solely on violent content thereby rendering ineffective any 
        technology-based blocking mechanism designed to limit violent 
        video programming.
            (11) The most recent study of the television ratings system 
        by the Kaiser Family Foundation concludes that 79 percent of 
        violent programming is not specifically rated for violence.
            (12) Technology-based solutions, such as the V-chip, may be 
        helpful in protecting some children, but cannot achieve the 
        compelling governmental interest in protecting all children 
        from violent programming when parents are only able to block 
        programming that has, in fact, been rated for violence.
            (13) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be 
        shown protects the interests of children whose parents are 
        unavailable, unable to supervise their children's viewing 
        behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based 
        solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based 
        solutions, or are unable to determine the content of those 
        shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.
            (14) After further study, pursuant to a rulemaking, the 
        Federal Communications Commission may conclude that content-
        based ratings and blocking technology do not effectively 
        protect children from the harm of violent video programming.
            (15) If the Federal Communications Commission reaches the 
        conclusion described in paragraph (14), the channeling of 
        violent video programming will be the least restrictive means 
        of limiting the exposure of children to the harmful influences 
        of violent video programming.

SEC. 1086. ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT RATING SYSTEM FOR 
              VIOLENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF V-CHIP IN BLOCKING VIOLENT 
              PROGRAMMING.

    (a) Report.--The Federal Communications Commission shall--
            (1) assess the effectiveness of measures to require 
        television broadcasters and multichannel video programming 
        distributors (as defined in section 602(13) of the 
        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 522(13)) to rate and 
        encode programming that could be blocked by parents using the 
        V-chip undertaken under section 715 of the Communications Act 
        of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 715) and under subsections (w) and (x) of 
        section 303 of that Act (47 U.S.C. 303(w) and (x)) in 
        accomplishing the purposes for which they were enacted; and
            (2) report its findings to the Committee on Commerce, 
        Science, and Transportation of the United States Senate and the 
        Committee on Energy and Commerce of the United States House of 
        Representatives, within 12 months after the date of enactment 
        of this Act, and annually thereafter.
    (b) Action.--If the Commission finds at any time, as a result of 
its ongoing assessment under subsection (a), that the measures referred 
to in subsection (a)(1) are insufficiently effective, then the 
Commission shall complete a rulemaking within 270 days after the date 
on which the Commission makes that finding to prohibit the distribution 
of violent video programming during the hours when children are 
reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience.
    (c) Definitions.--Any term used in this section that is defined in 
section 715 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 715), or in 
regulations under that section, has the same meaning as when used in 
that section or in those regulations.

SEC. 1087. UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO PROGRAMMING THAT IS 
              NOT SPECIFICALLY RATED FOR VIOLENCE AND THEREFORE IS NOT 
              BLOCKABLE.

    Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 715. UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO PROGRAMMING NOT 
              SPECIFICALLY BLOCKABLE BY ELECTRONIC MEANS.

    ``(a) Unlawful Distribution.--It shall be unlawful for any person 
to distribute to the public any violent video programming not blockable 
by electronic means specifically on the basis of its violent content 
during hours when children are reasonably likely to comprise a 
substantial portion of the audience.
    ``(b) Rulemaking Proceeding.--The Commission shall conduct a 
rulemaking proceeding to implement the provisions of this section and 
shall promulgate final regulations pursuant to that proceeding not 
later than 9 months after the date of enactment of the Children's 
Protection from Violent Programming Act. As part of that proceeding, 
the Commission--
            ``(1) may exempt from the prohibition under subsection (a) 
        programming (including news programs and sporting events) whose 
        distribution does not conflict with the objective of protecting 
        children from the negative influences of violent video 
        programming, as that objective is reflected in the findings in 
        section 551(a) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996;
            ``(2) shall exempt premium and pay-per-view cable 
        programming and premium and pay-per-view direct-to-home 
        satellite programming; and
            ``(3) shall define the term `hours when children are 
        reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the 
        audience' and the term `violent video programming'.
    ``(c) Enforcement.--
            ``(1) Forfeiture penalty.--The forfeiture penalties 
        established by section 503(b) for violations of section 1464 of 
        title 18, United States Code, shall apply to a violation of 
        this section, or any regulation promulgated under it in the 
        same manner as if a violation of this section, or such a 
        regulation, were a violation of law subject to a forfeiture 
        penalty under that section.
            ``(2) License revocation.--If a person repeatedly violates 
        this section or any regulation promulgated under this section, 
        the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for hearing, 
        revoke any license issued to that person under this Act.
            ``(3) License renewals.--The Commission shall consider, 
        among the elements in its review of an application for renewal 
        of a license under this Act, whether the licensee has complied 
        with this section and the regulations promulgated under this 
        section.
    ``(d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            ``(1) Blockable by electronic means.--The term `blockable 
        by electronic means' means blockable by the feature described 
        in section 303(x).
            ``(2) Distribute.--The term `distribute' means to send, 
        transmit, retransmit, telecast, broadcast, or cablecast, 
        including by wire, microwave, or satellite, but it does not 
        include the transmission, retransmission, or receipt of any 
        voice, data, graphics, or video telecommunications accessed 
        through an interactive computer service as defined in section 
        230(f)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 
        230(f)(2)), which is not originated or transmitted in the 
        ordinary course of business by a television broadcast station 
        or multichannel video programming distributor as defined in 
        section 602(13) of that Act (47 U.S.C. 522(13)).
            ``(3) Violent video programming.--The term `violent video 
        programming' as defined by the Commission may include matter 
        that is excessive or gratuitous violence within the meaning of 
        the 1992 Broadcast Standards for the Depiction of Violence in 
        Television Programs, December 1992.''.

SEC. 1088. SEPARABILITY.

    If any provision of this title, or any provision of an amendment 
made by this title, or the application thereof to particular persons or 
circumstances, is found to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this 
title or that amendment, or the application thereof to other persons or 
circumstances shall not be affected.

SEC. 1089. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The prohibition contained in section 715 of the Communications Act 
of 1934 (as added by section 204 of this title) and the regulations 
promulgated thereunder shall take effect 1 year after the regulations 
are adopted by the Commission.

        courses that will better prepare them for a career in the 
        intelligence community as a language analysts or intelligence 
        analyst;
            (2) provide each individual selected for participation in 
        the pilot program--
                    (A) financial assistance for the pursuit of courses 
                at institutions of higher education selected by the 
                Director in fields of study that will qualify such 
                individual for employment by an element of the 
                intelligence community as a language analyst or 
                intelligence analyst; and
                    (B) educational counseling on the selection of

SEC. 1108. REPORT ON HOW TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN INDIVIDUALS WITH FOREIGN 
              LANGUAGE SKILLS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Federal Government has a requirement to ensure that 
        the employees of its departments and agencies with national 
        security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges 
        of this evolving international environment.
            (2) According to a 2002 General Accounting Office report, 
        Federal agencies have shortages in translators and interpreters 
        and an overall shortfall in the language proficiency levels 
        needed to carry out their missions which has adversely affected 
        agency operations and hindered United States military, law 
        enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic 
        efforts.
            (3) Foreign language skills and area expertise are integral 
        to, or directly support, every foreign intelligence discipline 
        and are essential factors in national security readiness, 
        information superiority, and coalition peacekeeping or 
        warfighting missions.
            (4) Communicating in languages other than English and 
        understanding and accepting cultural and societal differences 
        are vital to the success of peacetime and wartime military and 
        intelligence activities.
            (5) Proficiency levels required for foreign language 
        support to national security functions have been raised, and 
        what was once considered proficiency is no longer the case. The 
        ability to comprehend and articulate technical and complex 
        information in foreign languages has become critical.
            (6) According to the Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry 
        into the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks, the Intelligence Community had 
        insufficient linguists prior to September 11, 2001, to handle 
        the challenge it faced in translating the volumes of foreign 
        language counterterrorism intelligence it collected. Agencies 
        within the Intelligence Community experienced backlogs in 
        material awaiting translation, a shortage of language 
        specialists and language-qualified field officers, and a 
        readiness level of only 30 percent in the most critical 
        terrorism-related languages that are used by terrorists.
            (7) Because of this shortage, the Federal Government has 
        had to enter into private contracts to procure linguist and 
        translator services, including in some positions that would be

              PROGRAM IN WESTERN NEW YORK AND WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA 
              REGION.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) New York has 36 current or former Department of Energy 
        facilities involved in nuclear weapons production-related 
        activities statewide, mostly atomic weapons employer 
        facilities, and 14 such facilities in western New York. Despite 
        having one of the greatest concentrations of such facilities in 
        the United States, western New York, and abutting areas of 
        Pennsylvania, continue to be severely underserved by the Energy 
        Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program under the 
        Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act 
        of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law by 
        Public Law 106-398); 42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.).
            (2) The establishment of a permanent resource center in 
        western New York would represent a substantial step toward 
        improving services under the Energy Employees Occupational 
        Illness Compensation Program for energy employees in this 
        region.
            (3) The number of claims submitted to the Department under 
        subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness 
        Compensation Program Act of 2000 from the western New York 
        region, including western Pennsylvania, exceeds the number of 
        such claims filed at resource centers in Hanford, Washington, 
        Portsmouth, Ohio, Los Alamos, New Mexico, the Nevada Test Site, 
        Nevada, the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, 
        Colorado, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho, and 
        the Amchitka Test Site, Alaska.
            (4) Energy employees in the western New York region, 
        including western Pennsylvania, deserve assistance under 
        subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness 
        Compensation Program Act of 2000 commensurate with the 
        assistance provided energy employees at other locations in the 
        United States.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to encourage 
the Office of Ombudsman of the Department of Labor, as established by 
section 3669 of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation 
Program Act of 2000 (as amended by section 3163 of this Act), to--
            (1) review the availability of assistance under subtitle B 
        of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation 
        Program Act of 2000 for energy employees in the western New 
        York region, including western Pennsylvania; and
            (2) recommend a location in that region for a resource 
        center to provide such assistance to such energy employees.

              MEMBERS OF COHORT.

    Section 3621(14)(C)(ii) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 10 7384l(14)(C)(ii)) 
is amended by striking ``180 days'' and inserting ``60 days.''

            (1) Energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities 
        (including the St. Louis downtown facility and the Weldon

        maximum allowable Federal standards.
            (2) The Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were 
        exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative 
        to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers 
        were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure.
            (3)(A) The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy 
        Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations 
        described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with respect 
        to worker exposures.
            (B) Workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of 
        uranium per day causing kidney damage.
            (C) A recent epidemiological study found excess levels of 
        nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts.
            (4) The Department of Energy has admitted that those 
        Mallinkrodt workers were subjected to risks and had their 
        health endangered as a result of working with these highly 
        radioactive materials.
            (5) The Department of Energy reported that workers at the 
        Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and 
        recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive.
            (6) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
        Health admits that--
                    (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site 
                consisted of intense periods of processing extremely 
                high levels of radionuclides; and
                    (B) the Institute has virtually no personal 
                monitoring data for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.
            (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
        Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 
        Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part of 
        the dose reconstruction process, it--
                    (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to 
                conduct dose reconstruction for the claimant; and
                    (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that 
                incompletely or inaccurately estimates the radiation 
                dose to which the energy employee named in the claim 
                had been exposed.
            (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also 
        known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and the 
        Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed to 
        levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, including 
        enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted uranium, in 
        addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that are greater 
        than the current maximum Federal standards for exposure.
            (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational 
        Safety and Health--
                    (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including 
                bioassays or air samples, have been located that 
                indicate any monitoring occurred of internal doses of 
                radiation to which workers described in paragraph (8) 
                were exposed;
                    (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including 
                dosimetry badges, have been located to indicate that 
                any monitoring occurred of the external doses of 
                radiation to which such workers were exposed;
                    (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that 
                only 8 to 23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were 
                monitored for external radiation doses; and
                    (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of 
                screening at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 
                percent of the workforce was screened for exposure to 
                external radiation.
            (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published 
        the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the Special 
        Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and the final rule published 
        on May 26, 2004.
            (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting 
        for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some claimants 
        who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be completed.
            (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the 
        serious lack of records and the death of many potential 
        claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose 
        reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility or 
        the Mallinkrodt facilities.
    (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section 
3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation 
Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. Spence National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law by 
Public Law 106-398); 42 U.S.C. 7384l(14)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); 
        and
            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new 
        subparagraph (C):
                    ``(C) Subject to the provisions of section 3612A 
                and section 3146(e) of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, the employee 
                was so employed for a number of work days aggregating 
                at least 45 workdays at a facility operated under 
                contract to the Department of Energy by Mallinkrodt 
                Incorporated or its successors (including the St. Louis 
                downtown or `Destrehan' facility during any of calendar 
                years 1942 through 1958 and the Weldon Springs feed 
                materials plant facility during any of calendar years 
                1958 through 1966), or at a facility operated by the 
                Department of Energy or under contract by Mason & 
                Hangar-Silas Mason Company at the Iowa Army Ammunition 
                Plant (also known as the Burlington Atomic Energy 
                Commission Plant and the Iowa Ordnance Plant) during 
                any of the calendar years 1947 through 1975, and during 
                the employment--
                            ``(i)(I) was monitored through the use of 
                        dosimetry badges for exposure at the plant of 
                        the external parts of an employee's body to 
                        radiation; or
                            ``(II) was monitored through the use of 
                        bioassays, in vivo monitoring, or breath 
                        samples for exposure at the plant to internal 
                        radiation; or
                            ``(ii) worked in a job that had exposures 
                        comparable to a job that is monitored, or 
                        should have been monitored, under standards of 
                        the Department of Energy in effect on the date 
                        of enactment of this subparagraph through the 
                        use of dosimetry badges for monitoring external 
                        radiation exposures, or bioassays, in vivo 
                        monitoring, or breath samples for internal 
                        radiation exposures, at a facility.''.
    (c) Funding of Compensation and Benefits.--(1) Such Act is further 
amended by inserting after section 3612 the following new section:

``SEC. 3612A. FUNDING FOR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN MEMBERS 
              OF THE SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT.

    ``(a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is hereby authorized 
to be appropriated to the Department of Labor for each fiscal year 
after fiscal year 2004 such sums as may be necessary for the provision 
of compensation and benefits under the compensation program for members 
of the Special Exposure Cohort described in section 3621(14)(C) in such 
fiscal year.
    ``(b) Prohibition on Use for Administrative Costs.--(1) No amount 
authorized to be appropriated by subsection (a) may be utilized for 
purposes of carrying out the compensation program for the members of 
the Special Exposure Cohort referred to in that subsection or 
administering the amount authorized to be appropriated by subsection 
(a).
    ``(2) Amounts for purposes described in paragraph (1) shall be 
derived from amounts authorized to be appropriated by section 3614(a).
    ``(c) Provision of Compensation and Benefits Subject to 
Appropriations Acts.--The provision of compensation and benefits under 
the compensation program for members of the Special Exposure Cohort 
referred to in subsection (a) in any fiscal year shall be subject to 
the availability of appropriations for that purpose for such fiscal 
year and to applicable provisions of appropriations Acts.''.
    (2) Section 3612(d) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7384e(d)) is amended--
            (A) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``Subject''; and
            (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(2) Amounts for the provision of compensation and benefits under 
the compensation program for members of the Special Exposure Cohort 
described in section 3621(14)(C) may be derived from amounts authorized 
to be appropriated by section 3612A(a).''.

subsection (b)(2), if the Director of the National Institute of 
Occupational Safety and Health certifies with respect to such facility 
each of the following:
            (1) That no atomic weapons work or related work has been 
        conducted at such facility after 1976.
            (2) That fewer than 50 percent of the total number of 
        workers engaged in atomic weapons work or related work at such 
        facility were accurately monitored for exposure to internal and 
        external ionizing radiation during the term of their 
        employment.
            (3) That individual internal and external exposure records 
        for employees at such facility are not available, or the 
        exposure to radiation of at least 40 percent of the exposed 
        workers at such facility cannot be determined from the 
        individual internal and external exposure records that are 
        available.
    (f) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that all  
employees who are eligible to apply for benefits under the compensation 
program established by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness 
Compensation Act should be treated fairly and equitably with regard to 
inclusion under the special exposure cohort provisions of this Act.

          TITLE XXXIV--LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT.

SEC. 3401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement Enhancement 
Act of 2004''.

SEC. 3402. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or 
        perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, 
        sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a serious 
        national problem.
            (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of 
        communities and is deeply divisive.
            (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue 
        to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of 
        violent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes 
        motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out their 
        responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal 
        assistance.
            (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this 
        problem.
            (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime 
        motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual 
        victim and the family and friends of the victim, but frequently 
        savages the community sharing the traits that caused the victim 
        to be selected.
            (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce 
        in many ways, including--
                    (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted 
                groups and forcing such members to move across State 
                lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence; 
                and
                    (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from 
                purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining 
                employment, or participating in other commercial 
                activity.
            (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.
            (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of 
        interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of 
        such violence.
            (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have 
        traveled in interstate commerce.
            (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and 
        involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and 
        ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary 
        servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption 
        of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, 
        through widespread public and private violence directed at 
        persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or perceived 
        race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially 
        motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the 
        extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery 
        and involuntary servitude.
            (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
        amendments to the Constitution of the United States were 
        adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious 
        and national origin groups were and are perceived to be 
        distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent 
        possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is 
        necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of real or 
        perceived religions or national origins, at least to the extent 
        such religions or national origins were regarded as races at 
        the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments 
        to the Constitution of the United States.
            (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes 
        motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
        to work together as partners in the investigation and 
        prosecution of such crimes.
            (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
        sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as 
        to warrant Federal assistance to States and local 
        jurisdictions.

SEC. 3403. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.

    In this title, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning as in 
section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).

SEC. 3404. SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS BY 
              STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

    (a) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--
            (1) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement 
        official of a State or Indian tribe, the Attorney General may 
        provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form 
        of assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of 
        any crime that--
                    (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in 
                section 16 of title 18, United States Code);
                    (B) constitutes a felony under the laws of the 
                State or Indian tribe; and
                    (C) is motivated by prejudice based on the race, 
                color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual 
                orientation, or disability of the victim, or is a 
                violation of the hate crime laws of the State or Indian 
                tribe.
            (2) Priority.--In providing assistance under paragraph (1), 
        the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes committed by 
        offenders who have committed crimes in more than 1 State and to 
        rural jurisdictions that have difficulty covering the 
        extraordinary expenses relating to the investigation or 
        prosecution of the crime.
    (b) Grants.--
            (1) In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to 
        assist State, local, and Indian law enforcement officials with 
        the extraordinary expenses associated with the investigation 
        and prosecution of hate crimes.
            (2) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant 
        program, the Office of Justice Programs shall work closely with 
        the funded jurisdictions to ensure that the concerns and needs 
        of all affected parties, including community groups and 
        schools, colleges, and universities, are addressed through the 
        local infrastructure developed under the grants.
            (3)  Application.--
                    (A) In general.--Each State that desires a grant 
                under this subsection shall submit an application to 
                the Attorney General at such time, in such manner, and 
                accompanied by or containing such information as the 
                Attorney General shall reasonably require.
                    (B) Date for submission.--Applications submitted 
                pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be submitted during 
                the 60-day period beginning on a date that the Attorney 
                General shall prescribe.
                    (C) Requirements.--A State or political subdivision 
                of a State or tribal official applying for assistance 
                under this subsection shall--
                            (i) describe the extraordinary purposes for 
                        which the grant is needed;
                            (ii) certify that the State, political 
                        subdivision, or Indian tribe lacks the 
                        resources necessary to investigate or prosecute 
                        the hate crime;
