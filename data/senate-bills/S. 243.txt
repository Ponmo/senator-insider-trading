SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) there is a need to consolidate and expand State responsibility for
  the development, coordination, and management of statewide programs and
  services directed toward ensuring that older individuals have access to,
  and assistance in securing and maintaining, benefits and rights; and
  (2) recent program reports and current research and demonstration findings
  indicate that--
  (A) the incidence of elder abuse in domestic settings is estimated at
  approximately 1,500,000 cases per year;
  (B) only one out of eight cases of elder abuse comes to the attention of
  State elder abuse reporting systems;
  (C) half of the complaints received by the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman
  program relate to abuse, neglect, and exploitation of residents of long-term
  care facilities;
  (D) approximately 2,000,000 older individuals reside in an estimated 90,000
  long-term care facilities;
  (E) older individuals residing in long-term care facilities are among the
  most frail and most vulnerable elderly persons in the United States;
  (F) the advocacy services of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program,
  in conjunction with the services of legal assistance providers, are
  essential to protecting and enhancing the rights of residents of long-term
  care facilities;
  (G) more than persons in any other age group, older individuals rely on
  public benefit programs and services to meet income, housing, and health
  and supportive services needs;
  (H) benefits and protections for older individuals have expanded under
  Federal laws such as--
  (i) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001
  et seq.);
  (ii) the Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-348; 100
  Stat. 682);
  (iii) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621
  et seq.);
  (iv) the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.);
  (v) sections 1819 and 1919 of the Social Security Act, regarding nursing
  home reform (42 U.S.C. 1395i-3 and 1396r);
  (vi) section 1924 of the Social Security Act, regarding spousal
  impoverishment (42 U.S.C. 1395r-5);
  (vii) the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act of 1990
  (Public Law 101-625; 104 Stat. 4079); and
  (viii) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.);
  (I) a wide range of State legislative action has occurred in the area of
  elder rights, including legislative action regarding guardianship reform,
  insurance regulation, consumer protection, and the development of procedures
  for surrogate decisionmaking and advanced directives;
  (J) the Federal laws described in subparagraph (H) and the State laws
  resulting from the legislative action described in subparagraph (I) are
  complex and constitute a difficult challenge for older individuals who
  wish to take advantage of the benefits the laws provide;
  (K) the appropriate utilization of public benefit programs requires consumer
  knowledge of entitlements and skill in understanding complex Federal,
  State, and local laws and regulations;
  (L) there is growing evidence of the need to provide outreach, counseling,
  and assistance to older individuals on--
  (i) the public benefits to which they are entitled, including benefits
  under--
  (I) the supplemental security income, medicare, and medicaid programs
  established under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq., 1395
  et seq., and 1396 et seq.);
  (II) the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.); and
  (III) the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621
  et seq.); and
  (ii) the options available to the persons for public and private insurance,
  including health, long-term care, and life insurance, and retirement
  benefits;
  (M) it is estimated that only half of older individuals eligible for benefits
  under the supplemental security income program are currently enrolled;
  (N) it is estimated that only half of older individuals eligible for food
  stamps receive assistance; and
  (O) it is estimated that less than half of older individuals eligible for
  benefits under the medicaid program are currently enrolled.
  (b) PURPOSES- The purposes of this Act are to--
  (1) assist States in securing and maintaining for older individuals
  dignity, security, privacy, the exercise of individual initiative, access
  to resources and benefits to which the individuals are entitled by law,
  and protection from abuse, neglect, and exploitation;
  (2) require States to undertake a comprehensive approach in developing
  and maintaining elder rights programs;
  (3) authorize States to undertake State level activities in support of

  individuals;
  (4) require States to administer elder rights programs and services

  experience, which can be of immeasurable value to students as a part of
  the educational process;
  (4) intergenerational programs can provide older individuals with the
  opportunity to contribute skills and talents in the public schools;

  aging process, promoting more positive and balanced views of the realities
  of aging, and reducing negative stereotyping of older individuals;

  intergenerational programs serving older individuals in exchange for good
  faith commitments by older individuals to provide volunteer assistance in
  the public schools; and

  initiatives, and intergenerational programs can help to enrich the support.

  individuals and elementary and secondary students in the schools, where

  elementary and secondary students who have limited-English proficiency or
  are at risk of--

  youth of the United States by contributing the unique knowledge, talents,
  and sense of history of older individuals through roles as volunteer tutors,
  teacher aides, living historians, special speakers, playground supervisors,
  lunchroom assistants, and many other school support roles;
  (4) to provide an opportunity for older individuals to obtain access to
  school facilities and resources, such as libraries, gymnasiums, theaters,
  cafeterias, audiovisual resources, and transportation; and
  (5) to create other programs for group interaction between students and
  older individuals, including class discussions, dramatic programs, shared

  services, offers an innovative, proven, and cost-effective means of
  enabling frail older individuals and disabled individuals to maintain
  dignity and independence;
  (2) independent living with assistance is a preferable housing alternative
  to institutionalization for many frail older and disabled individuals;
  (3) 365,000 older individuals in federally assisted housing experience
  some form of frailty, and the number is expected to increase as the general
  population ages;
  (4) a growing number of frail older individuals who are residents
  of federally assisted housing projects face premature or unnecessary
  institutionalization because of the absence of, or deficiencies in,
  availability, adequacy, coordination, or delivery of supportive services;
  (5) the supportive service needs of frail residents of federally assisted
  housing are beyond the resources and experience that housing managers have
  for meeting such needs;
  (6) the supportive needs of frail residents of federally assisted housing
  are beyond the resources that the area agencies on aging have for meeting
  such needs; and
  (7) with the necessary resources, the network of area agencies on aging could
  provide supportive services to older residents of federally assisted housing
  projects in an effective manner and reduce the incidence of premature and
  unnecessary institutionalization.
  (b) PURPOSES- The purposes of this Act are--
  (1) to provide services to frail older individuals in federally assisted
  housing projects through the aging network of area agencies on aging and
  the subcontractors of the agencies;
  (2) to improve the quality of life for older individuals living in federally
  assisted housing;
  (3) to better target the resources of the Administration to low-income
  individuals, with particular attention to low-income minority individuals;
  (4) to develop partnerships and models for coordination between Department
  of Housing and Urban Development and Farmers Home Administration projects
  and the aging network;
  (5) to involve the aging network in the development of the Comprehensive
  Housing Affordability Strategy and other programs serving older individuals
  under the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act of 1990
  (Public Law 101-625, 104 Stat. 4079);

  identify and assess the housing and supportive service needs of older
  individuals; and

  of the area agencies on aging and State agencies.
