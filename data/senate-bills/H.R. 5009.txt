executive for the Air Force for space systems and programs, shall 
maintain a list of contractors with a history of poor performance on 
space procurement contracts.
    ``(b) <<NOTE: Determinations.>>  Basis for Inclusion on Watch 
List.--(1) The Assistant Secretary shall place a contractor, which may 
consist of the entire contracting entity or a specific division of the 
contracting entity, on the watch list based on a determination made

list, the Assistant Secretary shall determine whether there is evidence 
of any of the following:
            ``(i) Poor performance on one or more space procurement

        control, or influence.

determines, based on evidence described in any of clauses (i) through 
(iv) of subparagraph (A), that the ability of a contractor to 
responsibly perform is meaningfully impaired, the Assistant Secretary 
shall place the contractor on the watch list.

    ``(C) <<NOTE: Policies.>>  The Assistant Secretary shall establish 
written policies for the consideration of contractors for placement on 
the watch list, including policies that require that--

SEC. 1638. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF ARTIFICIAL 
                          INTELLIGENCE TO SUPPORT STRATEGIC 
                          DETERRENCE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the considered use of artificial intelligence and 
        machine learning tools presents opportunities to strengthen the 
        security of critical strategic communications and early warning 
        networks, improve the efficiency of planning processes to reduce 
        the risk of collateral damage, and enhance U.S. capabilities for 
        modeling weapons functionality in support of stockpile 
        stewardship; and
            (2) even with such applications, particular care must be 
        taken to ensure that the incorporation of artificial 
        intelligence and machine learning tools does not increase the 
        risk that our Nation's most critical strategic assets can be 
        compromised.

    (b) <<NOTE: 10 USC 491 note.>> Statement of Policy.--It is the 
policy of the United States that the use of artificial intelligence 
efforts should not compromise the integrity of nuclear safeguards, 
whether through the functionality of weapons systems, the validation of 
communications from command authorities, or the principle of requiring 
positive human actions in execution of decisions by the President with 
respect to the employment of nuclear weapons.

        through cybersecurity and other upgrades to the Aircraft 
        Communications, Reporting and Addressing System and Controller 
        Pilot Data Link Communications;
            (4) whether the Federal Aviation Administration is requiring 
        sufficient cybersecurity and electromagnetic spectrum defenses 
        to address denial of service attacks and other risks in new 
        technologies it mandates be used on aircraft; and
            (5) any other item determined appropriate by the Comptroller 
        General.

                    (B) Unclassified form.--In preparing the report 
                under subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General shall 
                ensure that any classified information is only in an

                          GOLD MEDAL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war against 
        Germany. As a historically neutral nation, the United States was 
        unprepared to fight a technologically modern conflict overseas. 
        The United States called upon American Telephone and Telegraph 
        (referred to in this section as ``AT&T'') to provide equipment 
        and trained personnel for the Army Signal Corps in France. AT&T 
        executives in Army uniform served at home under the provisions 
        of the Act entitled ``An Act for making further and more 
        effectual provision for the national defense, and for other 
        purposes.'', approved June 3, 1916 (referred to in this section 
        as the ``National Defense Act of 1916''), which allowed for the 
        induction of individuals with specialized skills into a reserve 
        force.
            (2) When General John Pershing sailed for Europe in May of 
        1917, as head of the American Expeditionary Forces (referred to 
        in this section as the ``AEF''), he took telephone operating 
        equipment with him in recognition of the inadequacy of European 
        circuitry and with the understanding that telephones would play 
        a key role in battlefield communications for the first time in 
        the history of war.
            (3) From May to November of 1917, the AEF struggled to 
        develop the telephone service necessary for the Army to function 
        under battlefield conditions. Monolingual infantrymen from the 
        United States were unable to connect calls rapidly or 
        communicate effectively with their French counterparts to put 
        calls through over toll lines that linked one region of the 
        country with another. The Army found that the average male 
        operator required 60 seconds to make a connection. That rate was 
        unacceptably slow, especially for operational calls between 
        command outposts and the front lines.
            (4) During this time, in the United States, telephone 
        operating was largely sex-segregated. Hired for their speed in 
        connecting calls, women filled 85 percent of the telephone 
        operating positions in the United States. It took the average 
        female operator 10 seconds to make a connection.
            (5) On November 8, 1917, General Pershing cabled the War 
        Department and wrote, ``On account of the great difficulty of 
        obtaining properly qualified men, request organization and 
        dispatch to France a force of women telephone operators all 
        speaking French and English equally well.''. To begin, General 
        Pershing requested 100 women under the command of a commissioned 
        captain, writing that ``All should have allowances of Army 
        nurses and should be uniformed.''.
            (6) The War Department sent press releases to newspapers 
        across the United States to recruit women willing to serve for 
        the duration of the war and face the hazards of submarine 
        warfare and aerial bombardment. These articles emphasized that 
        patriotic women would be ``full-fledged soldier[s] under the 
        articles of war'' and would ``do as much to help win the

[[Page 138 STAT. 2468]]

        war as the men in khaki who go `over the top.' ''. All women 
        selected would take the Army oath.
            (7) More than 7,600 women volunteered for the 100 positions 
        described in paragraph (5) and the first recruits took the Army 
        oath on January 15, 1918.
            (8) Like nurses and doctors at the time, female Signal Corps 
        members had relative rather than traditional ranks and were 
        ranked as Operator, Supervisor, or Chief Operator. When 
        promoted, the women were required to swear the Army oath again.
            (9) Telephone operators were the first women to serve as 
        soldiers in non-medical classifications and the job of the 
        operators was to help win the war, not to mitigate the harms of 
        the war. In popular parlance, they were known as the ``Hello 
        Girls''.
            (10) Signal Corps Operators wore Army uniforms and Army 
        insignia always, as well as standard-issue identity disks in 
        case of death, and were subject to court martial for infractions 
        of the military code.
            (11) Unbeknownst to the women operators and their immediate 
        officers, the legal counsel of the Army ruled internally on 
        March 20, 1918, that the women were not actually soldiers but 
        contract employees, even though the women had not seen or signed 
        any contracts. Military code allowed only for the induction of 
        men and the code remained unchanged despite the orders of 
        General Pershing. Nevertheless, legal counsel also recognized 
        that the National Defense Act of 1916, which allowed for the 
        induction of members of the telephone industry of the United 
        States into the Armed Forces, imposed no gender restrictions.
            (12) Four days later, on March 24, 1918, the first 
        contingent of operators began their official duties in France. 
        The operators arrived before most infantrymen of the Armed 
        Forces in order to facilitate logistics and deployment and spent 
        their first night in Paris under German bombardment.
            (13) After the arrival of the operators, telephone service 
        in France improved immediately, as calls tripled from 13,000 to 
        36,000 per day.
            (14) The Army quickly recruited, trained, and deployed 5 
        additional contingents of female Signal Corps operators. With 
        these personnel, calls increased to 150,000 per day.
            (15) In addition to standard telephone operating, bilingual 
        Signal Corps members provided simultaneous translation between 
        officers from France and officers from the United States, who 
        were communicating by telephone.
            (16) The AEF fought their first major battles in the last 2 
        months of the war. By that point, the Signal Corps considered 
        the contributions of women to be so essential that, in telephone 
        exchanges closest to the front line, the Army exclusively used 
        women, in rotating 12-hour shifts. In the rear, the Army 
        established rotating 8-hour shifts and gave male soldiers the 
        overnight shift when telephone traffic was slower.
            (17) Seven bilingual operators--
                    (A) served at the Battles of St. Mihiel and Meuse-
                Argonne under the immediate command of General Pershing;

[[Page 138 STAT. 2469]]

                    (B) staffed the Operations Boards through which 
                orders to advance, fire, and retreat were delivered to 
                soldiers in the trenches, to artillery units on alert, 
                and to pilots awaiting orders at French airfields; and
                    (C) were awarded a ``Defensive Sector Clasp'' for 
                the Meuse-Argonne operation.
            (18) The Chief Operator supervising the Hello Girls, Grace 
        Banker of Passaic, New Jersey, was awarded the Distinguished 
        Service Medal. Out of 16,000 eligible Signal Corps officers, 
        Banker was one of only 18 individuals so honored.
            (19) Thirty additional operators received special 
        commendations, many signed by General Pershing himself, for 
        ``exceptionally meritorious and conspicuous services'' in 
        ``Advance Sections'' of the conflict.
            (20) The war ended on November 11, 1918. As of that date, 
        223 female operators served in France and had connected 
        26,000,000 calls for the AEF.
            (21) The Chief Signal Officer of the Army Signal Corps wrote 
        in his official report 2 days after the date on which the war 
        ended that ``a large part of the success of the communications 
        of this Army is due to . . . a competent staff of women 
        operators.''.
            (22) After the war ended, some women were ordered to Coblenz 
        in Germany for the occupation of that country and to Paris for 
        the Paris Peace Treaty of 1919 to continue telephone operations, 
        sometimes in direct support of President Woodrow Wilson.
            (23) Two operators, Corah Bartlett and Inez Crittenden, died 
        in France in the service of the United States and were buried 
        there in military cemeteries with military ceremonies. Those 
        operators died of the same influenza pandemic that killed more 
        soldiers of the Armed Forces than combat operations.
            (24) Women of the Army Signal Corps were ineligible for 
        discharge until formal release. Because of their role in 
        logistics, those women were among the last soldiers to come home 
        to the United States. The last Signal Corps operators returned 
        from France in January of 1920.
            (25) Upon arrival in the United States, the Army informed 
        female veterans that they had performed as civilians, not 
        soldiers, even though operators had served in Army uniform in a 
        theater of war surrounded by men who were similarly engaged.
            (26) Despite the objections of General George Squier, the 
        top-ranking officer in the Signal Corps, the Army denied Signal 
        Corps women the veterans' benefits granted to male soldiers and 
        female nurses, such as--
                    (A) hospitalization for disabilities incurred in the 
                line of duty;
                    (B) cash bonuses;
                    (C) soldiers' pensions;
                    (D) flags on their coffins; and
                    (E) the Victory Medals promised them in France.
            (27) For the next 60 years, female veterans, led by Merle 
        Egan from Montana, petitioned Congress more than 50 times for 
        their recognition. In 1977, under the sponsorship of Senator 
        Barry Goldwater, Congress passed legislation to retroactively

[[Page 138 STAT. 2470]]

        acknowledge the military service of the Women's Airforce Service 
        Pilots (referred to in this section as ``WASPs'') of World War 
        II and ``the service of any person in any other similarly 
        situated group the members of which rendered service to the 
        Armed Forces of the United States in a capacity considered 
        civilian employment or contractual service at the time such 
        service was rendered''.
            (28) On November 23, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed the 
        legislation described in paragraph (27) into law as the GI Bill 
        Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202; 91 Stat. 1433).
            (29) The Signal Corps telephone operators applied for, and 
        were granted, status as veterans in 1979.
            (30) Only 33 of the operators who had returned home after 
        the war were still alive to receive their Victory Medals and 
        official discharge papers, which were finally awarded in 1979.
            (31) One of the women, Olive Shaw from Massachusetts, 
        returned to the United States after the war, where she worked on 
        the professional staff of Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers. 
        Shaw lived to receive her honorable discharge and was the first 
        burial when the Massachusetts National Cemetery opened on 
        October 11, 1980. Shaw's uniform is on display at the National 
        World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri.
            (32) Upon receipt of her honorable discharge at a ceremony 
        in her home in Marine City, Michigan, ``Hello Girl'' Oleda Joure 
        Christides raised the paper to her lips and kissed it. The only 
        thing Christides ever wanted from the Federal Government was a 
        flag on her coffin.
            (33) On July 1, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law 
        Public Law 111-40 (123 Stat. 1958), which awarded the WASPs the 
        Congressional Gold Medal for their service to the United States.
            (34) For their role as pioneers who paved the way for all 
        women in uniform, and for service that was essential to victory 
        in World War I, the ``Hello Girls'' merit similar recognition.

    (b) Congressional Gold Medal.--
            (1) Award authorized.--The Speaker of the House of 
        Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate 
        shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of 
        Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor 
        of the female telephone operators of the Army Signal Corps 
        (commonly known as the ``Hello Girls''), in recognition of those 
        operators'--
                    (A) pioneering military service;
                    (B) devotion to duty; and
                    (C) 60-year struggle for--
                          (i) recognition as soldiers; and
                          (ii) veterans' benefits.
            (2) <<NOTE: Determination.>> Design and striking.--For the

                available for display, as appropriate, and made 
                available for research.
                    (B) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress 
                that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold 
                medal received under subparagraph (A) available 
                elsewhere, particularly at--
                          (i) appropriate locations associated with--

                          (ii) any other location determined appropriate 
                      by the Smithsonian Institution.

    (c) Duplicate Medals.--Under such regulations as the Secretary may 
prescribe, the Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the 
gold medal struck under subsection (b) at a price sufficient to cover 
the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, dies, use of 
machinery, and overhead expenses.
    (d) National Medals.--

                      TITLE LXXI--WORKFORCE MATTERS

SEC. 7101. COMPETITIVE LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the effectiveness and stability of United States foreign 
        missions are linked to the dedication and expertise of locally 
        employed staff; and
            (2) ensuring competitive compensation packages benchmarked 
        against the local market is essential not only to retain 
        valuable talent but also to reflect a commitment to employment 
        practices abroad.
SEC. 7102. <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  STRATEGY FOR TARGETED RECRUITMENT 
                          OF CIVIL SERVANTS.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,

and proactive recruitment to fill open civil service positions, focusing 
on recruiting from schools or organizations, and on platforms targeting 
those with relevant expertise related to such positions.
SEC. 7103. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--

[[Page 138 STAT. 2527]]

            (1) Foreign Service personnel at the Department serve with 
        distinction in austere places and under challenging conditions 
        around the world with limited healthcare availability;
            (2) the use of paper medical records, which require Foreign 
        Service personnel to carry files containing protected health 
        information from post to post, limits the availability of their 
        health information to Department medical personnel during 
        critical health incidents;
            (3) electronic medical records are necessary, particularly 
        as the Department opens new embassies in the South Pacific, 
        thousands of miles from the nearest Department medical officer, 
        who may not have access to up-to-date personnel medical files;
            (4) the lack of electronic medical records is even more 
        important for mental health records, as the Department only has 
        a small number of regional medical officer psychiatrists and 
        relies heavily on telehealth for most Foreign Service personnel; 
        and
            (5) due to the critical need for electronic medical records, 
        it is imperative that the Department address the situation 
        quickly and focus on secure commercially available or other 
        successful systems utilized by public and private sector 
        organizations with a track record of successfully implementing

                          DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Increasing the United States' global diplomatic 
        footprint is imperative to advance United States' national 
        security interests, particularly in the face of a massive 
        diplomatic expansion of our strategic competitors.
            (2) Opening or re-opening diplomatic missions, often in 
        small island nations where there is no United States Government 
        presence, but one is needed to advance United States strategic 
        objectives.
            (3) Diplomatic missions should be resourced and equipped for 
        success upon opening to allow diplomats to focus on advancing 
        United States national interests in-country.
            (4) The United States can and should move more swiftly to 
        open new diplomatic missions and provide United States diplomats 
        and locally employed staff with a workplace that meets locally 
        appropriate quality, safety, and security standards.
            (5) To do this, the Department must streamline and support 
        the process of opening new posts to identify efficiencies and 
        remove obstacles that are unduly complicating the opening of new 
        diplomatic missions, particularly in small island states and 
        similarly situated locations.

    (b) Report to Congress.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations 
        of the House of Representatives a report on how the Department 
        is creating a new framework to provide such diplomatic missions 
        the needed resources and authorities to quickly and efficiently 
        stand up and operate from the moment United States personnel 
        arrive, or even before the opening of a new mission, 
        particularly in small island nations.
            (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall
