                               RESOLUTION


 
            Concerning United States-Japan Trade Relations.
Whereas the United States and Japan have a long and important relationship which 
        serves as an anchor of peace and stability in the Pacific region;
Whereas tension exists in an otherwise normal and friendly relationship between 
        the United States and Japan because of persistent and large trade 
        deficits which are the result of practices and regulations which have 
        substantially blocked legitimate access of American automotive products 
        to the Japanese market;
Whereas the current account trade deficit with Japan in 1994 reached an historic 
        high level of $66 billion, of which $37 billion, or 56 percent, is 
        attributed to imbalances in automotive sector, and of which $12.8 
        billion is attributable to auto parts flows;
Whereas in July 1993, the Administration reached a broad accord with the 
        Government of Japan, which established automotive trade as one of 5 
        priority areas for negotiations, to seek market-opening arrangements 
        based on objective criteria and which would result in objective 
        progress;
Whereas a healthy American automobile industry is of central importance to the 
        American economy, and to the capability of the United States to fulfill 
        its commitments to remain as an engaged, deployed, Pacific power;
Whereas, after 18 months of negotiations with the Japanese, beginning in 
        September 1993, the United States Trade Representative concluded that no 
        progress had been achieved, leaving the auto parts market in Japan 
        ``virtually closed'';
Whereas in October 1994, the United States initiated an investigation under 
        section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into the Japanese auto parts 
        market, which could result in the imposition of trade sanctions on a 
        variety of Japanese imports into the United States unless measurable 
        progress is made in penetrating the Japanese auto parts market;
Whereas the latest round of United States-Japan negotiations on automotive 
        trade, in Whistler, Canada, collapsed in failure on May 5, 1995, and the 
        United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Kantor, stated the 
        ``Government of Japan has refused to address our most fundamental 
        concerns in all areas'' of automotive trade, and that ``discrimination 
        against foreign manufacturers of autos and auto parts continues.''; and
Whereas, President Clinton stated, on May 5, 1995, that the United States is 
        ``committed to taking strong action'' regarding Japanese imports into 
        the United States if no agreement is reached: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Senate regrets that negotiations between the United 
        States and Japan for sharp reductions in the trade imbalances 
        in automotive sales and parts, through elimination of 
        restrictive Japanese market-closing practices and regulations, 
        have collapsed; and
            (2) if negotiations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 
        1974 fail to open the Japanese auto parts market, the United 
        States Senate strongly supports the decision by the President 
        to impose sanctions on Japanese products in accordance with 
        section 301.
