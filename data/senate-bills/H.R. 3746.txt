                        ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS THAT AFFECT DIRECT 
                        SPENDING.

    (a) Discretionary Administrative Actions.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Review. Notice. Budget estimate.>>  In 
        general.--Before an agency may finalize any covered 
        discretionary administrative action, the head of the agency 
        shall submit to the Director for review written notice regarding 
        the covered discretionary administrative action, which shall 
        include an estimate of the budgetary effects of the covered 
        discretionary administrative action.
            (2) Increasing direct spending.--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Proposal.>>  In general.--If the covered 
                discretionary administrative action would increase 
                direct spending, the written notice submitted by the 
                head of the agency under paragraph (1) shall include a 
                proposal to undertake 1 or more other administrative 
                actions that would provide a reduction in direct 
                spending greater than or equal to the increase in direct 
                spending attributable to the covered discretionary 
                administrative action.
                    (B) Review.--
                          (i) In general.--The Director shall determine 
                      whether the reduction in direct spending in a 
                      proposal in a written notice from an agency under 
                      subparagraph (A) is greater than or equal to the 
                      increase in direct spending attributable to the 
                      covered discretionary administrative action to 
                      which the written notice relates.
                          (ii) No offset.--If the written notice 
                      regarding a proposed covered discretionary 
                      administrative action that would increase direct 
                      spending does not include a proposal to offset the 
                      increased direct spending as determined in clause 
                      (i), the Director shall return the written notice

                      this title.

    (b) Nondiscretionary Actions.--If an agency determines that an 
administrative action that would increase direct spending is required by 
law and therefore is not a covered discretionary administrative action, 
before the agency finalizes that administrative action, the head of the 
agency shall--
            (1) submit to the Director a written opinion by the general 
        counsel of the agency, or the equivalent employee of the agency, 
        explaining that legal conclusion;
            (2) <<NOTE: Projection.>>  submit to the Director a 
        projection of the amount of direct spending under the least 
        costly implementation option reasonably identifiable by the 
        agency that meets the requirements under the statute; and
            (3) <<NOTE: Consultation.>>  consult with the Director

        qualified State expenditures. <<NOTE: Guidance.>> The Secretary

        effect for 6 fiscal years, with one year to establish benchmark

    (a) Definition of Mountain Valley Pipeline.--In this section, the 
term ``Mountain Valley Pipeline'' means the Mountain Valley Pipeline 
project, as generally described and approved in Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Docket Nos. CP16-10, CP19-477, and CP21-57.
    (b) Congressional Findings and Declaration.--The Congress hereby 
finds and declares that the timely completion of construction and 
operation of the Mountain Valley Pipeline is required in the national 
interest. The Mountain Valley Pipeline will serve demonstrated natural 
gas demand in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast regions, will 
increase the reliability of natural gas supplies and the availability of 
natural gas at reasonable prices, will allow natural gas producers to 
access additional markets for their product, and will reduce carbon 
emissions and facilitate the energy transition.
    (c) Approval and Ratification and Maintenance of Existing 
Authorizations.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law--
            (1) Congress hereby ratifies and approves all 
        authorizations, permits, verifications, extensions, biological 
        opinions, incidental take statements, and any other approvals or 
        orders issued pursuant to Federal law necessary for the 
        construction and initial operation at full capacity of the 
        Mountain Valley Pipeline; and
            (2) Congress hereby directs the Secretary of the Army, the 
        Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Secretary of 
        Agriculture, and the Secretary of the Interior, and other 
        agencies as applicable, as the case may be, to continue to 
        maintain such authorizations, permits, verifications, 
        extensions, biological opinions, incidental take statements, and 
        any other approvals or orders issued pursuant to Federal law 
        necessary for the construction and initial operation at full 
        capacity of the Mountain Valley Pipeline.

    (d) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Expedited Approval.--Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, not later than 21 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act and for the purpose of facilitating the completion 
of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, the Secretary of the Army shall issue 
all permits or verifications necessary--
            (1) to complete the construction of the Mountain Valley 
        Pipeline across the waters of the United States; and
            (2) to allow for the operation and maintenance of the 
        Mountain Valley Pipeline.

    (e) Judicial Review.--
            (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court 
        shall have jurisdiction to review any action taken by the 
        Secretary of the Army, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
        the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, or 
        a State administrative agency acting pursuant to Federal law 
        that grants an authorization, permit, verification, biological 
        opinion, incidental take statement, or any other approval 
        necessary for the construction and initial operation at full 
        capacity of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, including the issuance 
        of any authorization, permit, extension, verification, 
        biological opinion, incidental take statement, or other approval 
        described in subsection (c) or (d) of this section for the 
        Mountain Valley Pipeline,

[[Page 137 STAT. 48]]

        whether issued prior to, on, or subsequent to the date of 
        enactment of this section, and including any lawsuit pending in 
        a court as of the date of enactment of this section.
            (2) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
        Columbia Circuit shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction 
        over any claim alleging the invalidity of this section or that 
        an action is beyond the scope of authority conferred by this 
        section.

    (f) Effect.--This section supersedes any other provision of law 
(including any other section of this Act or other statute, any 
regulation, any judicial decision, or any agency guidance) that is 
inconsistent with the issuance of any authorization, permit, 
verification, biological opinion, incidental take statement, or other 
approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline.
