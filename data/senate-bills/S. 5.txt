 [Struck out->] SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) the number of children living in homes where both
 parents work, or living in homes with a single parent who works, has
 increased dramatically over the last decade; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) the availability of quality child care is critical to
 the self-sufficiency and independence of millions of American families,
 including the growing number of mothers with young children who work out
 of economic necessity; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) high quality child care programs can strengthen our
 society by providing young children with the foundation on which to learn
 the basic skills necessary to be productive workers; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (4) the years from birth to age 6 are a critical period
 in the development of a young child; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (5) a significant number of parents do not have a real
 choice as they seek adequate child care for their young children because of
 limited incomes, insufficient State child care standards, and the inadequate
 supply of child care services in their community; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (6) high quality early childhood development programs
 provided during such period are cost effective because such programs can
 reduce the chances of juvenile delinquency and adolescent pregnancy and
 can improve the likelihood that children will finish high school and become
 employed; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (7) the number of quality child care arrangements falls far
 short of the number required for children in need of child care services;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (8) the rapid growth of participation in the labor force by
 mothers of children under the age of 1 has resulted in a critical shortage
 of quality child care arrangements for infants and toddlers; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (9) the lack of available child care services results
 in many preschool and school-age children being left without adequate
 supervision for significant parts of the day; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (10) many working parents who are unable to afford adequate
 child care services do not receive adequate financial assistance for such
 services from employers or public sources; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (11) because of the lack of affordable child care, a large
 number of parents are not able to work or to seek the training or education
 they need to become self sufficient; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (12) making adequate child care services available
 for parents who are employed, seeking employment, or seeking to develop
 employment skills promotes and strengthens the well-being of families and
 the national economy; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (13) the payment of the exceptionally low salaries to child
 care workers adversely affects the quality of child care services by making
 it difficult to retain qualified staff; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (14) several factors result in the shortage of quality
 child care options for children and parents, including-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (A) the inability of parents to pay for child care services;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (B) the lack of up-to-date information on child care
 services; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (C) the lack of training opportunities for staff in child
 care programs; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (D) the high rate of staff turnover in child care facilities;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (E) the wide differences among the States in child care
 licensing and enforcement policies; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (15) improved coordination of child care services will
 help to promote the most efficient use of child care resources. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (b) PURPOSES- The purposes of this Act are-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) to build on and to strengthen the role of the family by
 seeking to ensure that parents are not forced by lack of available programs
 or financial resources to place a child in an unsafe or unhealthy child
 care facility or arrangement; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) to promote the availability and diversity of quality
 child care services to expand child care options available to all families
 who need such services; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) to provide assistance to families whose financial
 resources are not sufficient to enable such families to pay the full cost
 of necessary child care services; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (4) to lessen the chances that children will be left to
 fend for themselves for significant parts of the day; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (5) to improve the productivity of parents in the labor
 force by lessening the stresses related to the absence of adequate child
 care services; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (6) to provide assistance to States to improve the quality
 of, and coordination among, child care programs; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (7) to increase the opportunities for attracting and
 retaining qualified staff in the field of child care to provide high quality
 child care services to children; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (8) to strengthen the competitiveness of the United
 States by providing young children with a sound early childhood development
 experience. [<-Struck out]

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that--
  (1) the number of children living in homes where both parents work, or
  living in homes with a single parent who works, has increased dramatically
  over the last decade;
  (2) the availability of quality child care is critical to the
  self-sufficiency and independence of millions of American families,
  including the growing number of mothers with young children who work out
  of economic necessity;
  (3) high quality child care programs can strengthen our society by providing
  young children with the foundation on which to learn the basic skills
  necessary to be productive workers;
  (4) the years from birth to age 6 are a critical period in the development
  of a young child;
  (5) a significant number of parents do not have a real choice as they seek
  adequate child care for their young children because of limited incomes,
  insufficient State child care standards, and the inadequate supply of
  child care services in their community;
  (6) high quality early childhood development programs provided during such
  period are cost effective because such programs can reduce the chances of
  juvenile delinquency and adolescent pregnancy and can improve the likelihood
  that children will finish high school and become employed;
  (7) the number of quality child care arrangements falls far short of the
  number required for children in need of child care services;
  (8) the rapid growth of participation in the labor force by mothers of
  children under the age of 1 has resulted in a critical shortage of quality
  child care arrangements for infants and toddlers;
  (9) the lack of available child care services results in many preschool and
  school-age children being left without adequate supervision for significant
  parts of the day;
  (10) many working parents who are unable to afford adequate child care
  services do not receive adequate financial assistance for such services
  from employers or public sources;
  (11) because of the lack of affordable child care, a large number of
  parents are not able to work or to seek the training or education they
  need to become self sufficient;
  (12) making adequate child care services available for parents who are
  employed, seeking employment, or seeking to develop employment skills
  promotes and strengthens the well-being of families and the national economy;
  (13) the payment of the exceptionally low salaries to child care workers
  adversely affects the quality of child care services by making it difficult
  to retain qualified staff;
  (14) several factors result in the shortage of quality child care options
  for children and parents, including--
  (A) the inability of parents to pay for child care services;
  (B) the lack of up-to-date information on child care services;
  (C) the lack of training opportunities for staff in child care programs;
  (D) the high rate of staff turnover in child care facilities; and
  (E) the wide differences among the States in child care licensing and
  enforcement policies; and
  (15) improved coordination of child care services will help to promote
  the most efficient use of child care resources.
  (b) PURPOSES- The purposes of this Act are--
  (1) to build on and to strengthen the role of the family by seeking
  to ensure that parents are not forced by lack of available programs or
  financial resources to place a child in an unsafe or unhealthy child care
  facility or arrangement;
  (2) to promote the availability and diversity of quality child care
  services to expand child care options available to all families who need
  such services;
  (3) to provide assistance to families whose financial resources are not
  sufficient to enable such families to pay the full cost of necessary child
  care services;
  (4) to lessen the chances that children will be left to fend for themselves
  for significant parts of the day;
  (5) to improve the productivity of parents in the labor force by lessening
  the stresses related to the absence of adequate child care services;
  (6) to provide assistance to States to improve the quality of, and
  coordination among, child care programs;
  (7) to increase the opportunities for attracting and retaining qualified
  staff in the field of child care to provide high quality child care services
  to children; and
  (8) to strengthen the competitiveness of the United States by providing
  young children with a sound early childhood development experience.
