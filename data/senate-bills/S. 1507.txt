  (3) provide highly effective theater missile defenses (TMD) to United
  States forward-deployed and expeditionary armed forces and to our friends
  and allies.
  (b) IMPLEMENTATION-
  (1) IN GENERAL- To implement this goal, Congress directs the Secretary
  of Defense to take the actions described in paragraph (2) and urges the
  President to take the actions described in paragraph (3).
  (2) ACTIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE-
  (A) TMD OPTIONS- The Congress directs the Secretary of Defense to
  aggressively pursue the development of a range of advanced TMD options, with
  the objective of downselecting and deploying such systems by the mid-1990s.
  (B) INITIAL DEPLOYMENT- The Congress further directs the Secretary
  to develop for deployment by fiscal year 1996 a cost-effective and
  operationally-effective and ABM Treaty-compliant anti-ballistic missile
  system at a single site as the initial step toward deployment of the
  anti-ballistic missile system described in subsection (a) designed to
  protect the United States against limited ballistic missile threats,
  including accidental or unauthorized launches or Third World attacks. The
  Treaty-compliant system to be developed under this subparagraph would
  include--
  (i) 100 ground-based interceptors, the design of which is to be determined
  by competition and downselection for the most capable interceptor deployable
  by fiscal year 1996;
  (ii) fixed, ground-based anti-ballistic missile battle management radar; and
  (iii) optimum utilization of space-based sensors, including sensors capable
  of cueing ground-based anti-ballistic missile interceptors and providing
  initial targeting vectors, and other sensor systems that also are not
  prohibited by the ABM Treaty.
  (C) DEPLOYMENT PLAN- Within 180 days after the date of the enactment of
  this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense
  committees a plan for the deployment of TMDs and an anti-ballistic missile
  system which meet the guidelines established in subparagraphs (A) and (B).
  (3) PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONS-
  (A) NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING ABM TREATY- Congress urges the President to pursue
  immediately negotiations to amend the ABM Treaty to permit completion of
  the anti-ballistic missile defense system described in subsection (a).
  (B) NEGOTIATING STRATEGY- The Congress further urges the President to
  adopt a new negotiating strategy to reach agreements with the Soviet Union
  necessary to permit the following:
  (i) Additional anti-ballistic missile sites and additional ground-based
  anti-ballistic missile interceptors.
  (ii) Increased utilization of space-based sensors for direct battle
  management.
  (iii) Clarification of what constitutes permissible development and testing
  of space-based missile defenses.
  (iv) Increased flexibility for technology development of advanced ballistic
  missile defenses.
  (v) Clarification of the distinctions between TMDs and anti-ballistic
  missile defenses, including interceptors and radars.

  (1) FOLLOW-ON ANTI-BALLISTIC MISSILE TECHNOLOGIES- To effectively develop
  technologies relevant to achieving the goal in subsection (a) and to provide
  future options for protecting the security of the United States and our
  allies and friends, robust research and development funding for promising
  follow-on anti-ballistic missile technologies, including Brilliant Pebbles,
  is required.

  congressional defense committees a report on conceptual and burdensharing
  issues associated with the option of deploying space-based interceptors,
  including Brilliant Pebbles, for the purpose of providing global defenses
  against ballistic missile attacks. Not more than 50 percent of the funds
  authorized in subsection (f)(2)(C) for the Space-Based Interceptors program
