  Commending the efforts of the Reverend Jesse Jackson to secure the

Whereas on March 31, 1999, Staff Sergeant Andrew A. Ramirez, Staff Sergeant 
        Christopher J. Stone, and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales were taken 
        prisoner by the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia while 
        on patrol along the Macedonia-Yugoslav border;
Whereas Sergeant Ramirez, Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales conducted 
        themselves throughout their ordeal with dignity, patriotism, and faith;
Whereas the Reverend Jesse Jackson led a delegation of religious leaders to the 
        Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that succeeded in negotiating the release 
        of Sergeant Ramirez, Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales; and
Whereas the Reverend Jesse Jackson has previously succeeded in securing the 
        release of hostages held in Syria, Cuba, and Iraq: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate commends the Reverend Jesse Jackson for his 
        successful efforts in securing the release of Sergeant Ramirez, 
        Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales, and for his leadership 
        and actions arising from his deep faith in God; and
            (2) the Senate joins the families of Sergeant Ramirez, 
        Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales in expressing relief 
        and joy at their safe release.
