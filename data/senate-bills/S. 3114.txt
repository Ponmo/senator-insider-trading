  `(b) ACTIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE-
  `(1) THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS- The Secretary of Defense shall
  develop advanced theater missile defense systems for deployment.
  `(2) INITIAL ABM DEPLOYMENT- The Secretary shall develop for deployment
  a cost-effective, operationally effective, and ABM Treaty-compliant
  antiballistic missile system at a single site as the initial step toward
  deployment of an antiballistic missile system described in section 232(a)(1)

  transfer management and budget responsibility for research and development
  of all far-term follow-on technologies currently under the Strategic Defense
  Initiative Organization to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
  (DARPA) or the appropriate military department, unless he determines
  and certifies to the congressional defense committees that transfer of a
  particular far-term follow-on technology currently under the Strategic
  Defense Initiative Organization would not be in the national security
  interests of the United States.

  technology' means a technology not likely to be incorporated into a weapon
  system within 10 to 15 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.

  `(A) IN GENERAL- Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of
  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, the Secretary
  of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report
  identifying--
  `(i) those programs, projects, and activities under the Other Follow-On
  Technologies program element for fiscal year 1993 which he is transferring to
  a military department or the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; and
  `(ii) those programs, projects, and activities under the Other Follow-On
  Technologies program element which the Secretary certifies are necessary
  in the national security interests of the United States to maintain under
  the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization.
  `(B) DEFINITION- In subparagraph (A), the term `programs, projects,
  and activities under the Other Follow-On Technologies program element for
  fiscal year 1993' means the programs, projects, and activities listed under

  the vicinity of military installations and National Guard facilities and

  (4) By providing self-worth, self-esteem, motivational, and basic skills
  training to youths.
  (5) By providing substance abuse counseling and treatment services.
  (6) By providing support for community drug treatment and prevention
  programs.

  civilian domestic needs of the United States.
  (2) Members of the Armed Forces have the training, education, and experience
  to serve as role models for United States youth.
  (3) As a result of the reductions in the Armed Forces resulting from
  the ending of the Cold War, the Armed Forces will have fewer overseas
  deployments and lower operating tempos, and there will be a much greater
  opportunity than in the past for the Armed Forces to assist civilian
  efforts to address critical domestic problems.
  (4) The United States has significant domestic needs in areas such as
  health care, nutrition, education, housing, and infrastructure that cannot
  be met by current and anticipated governmental and private sector programs.
  (5) There are significant opportunities for the resources of the Armed
  Forces, which are maintained for national security purposes, to be applied
  in cooperative efforts with civilian officials to address these vital
  domestic needs.
  (6) Civil-military cooperative efforts can be undertaken in a manner that
  is consistent with the military mission and does not compete with the
  private sector.
