CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
Condemning Iraq's unprovoked attack on Israel.
Whereas Israel is a major ally and close friend of the United States;
Whereas Iraq, without provocation, has launched several SCUD surface-to-surface
missile attacks on civilian targets in Israel;
Whereas some experts believe that Iraq may have the capability to arm its
SCUD missiles with chemical warheads, dramatically increasing the potential
that such missiles could do serious damage to Israel;
Whereas Iraq has threatened to `burn half of Israel' with chemical weapons;
Whereas every nation has the right to defend itself;
Whereas Israel has exhibited exceptional restraint in the face of Iraq's
repeated threats and SCUD attacks, has absorbed all Iraqi SCUD attacks to
date without military retaliation against Iraq, and continues to support
implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 through
the unprecedented international coalition of forces in the Persian Gulf; and
Whereas the United States has provided Patriot anti-missile missiles to
Israel, to help that nation defend itself against further Iraqi attacks
utilizing SCUD missiles: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That
  the Congress--
  (1) condemns the unprovoked attacks by Iraq on Israel, and declares that
  the purposeful use of SCUD missiles to conduct indiscriminate attacks
  against civilian targets is a form of terrorism;
  (2) expresses profound sympathy for the loss of life, casualties, and
  destruction caused by the Iraqi attacks;
  (3) recognizes Israel's right to defend itself;
  (4) commends the Government of Israel for its restraint;
  (5) commends the people of Israel for their brave and composed perseverance
  in the face of the Iraqi attacks;
  (6) commends the Administration for its decision to provide Patriot missiles
  to Israel; and
  (7) reaffirms America's continued commitment to providing Israel with the
  means to maintain its security and freedom.
