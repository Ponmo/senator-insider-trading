SEC. 168. GREAT LAKES FISHERY COMMISSION.
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that--
  (1) Dr. Vernon C. Applegate created and supervised the sea lamprey research
  program in the Great Lakes from 1950 to 1960;
  (2) Dr. Vernon C. Applegate, through his tireless efforts, characterized
  the life cycle of the sea lamprey, tested over 6000 chemicals to find the
  one to which sea lamprey larvae were most susceptible, and applied this
  lampricide with minimal effects on the environment;
  (3) the United States and, especially, the Great Lakes community owe a debt
  of gratitude to Dr. Vernon C. Applegate without whom a valuable fishery
  resource may have been lost;
  (4) current efforts and techniques are inadequate to control sea lamprey
  in many areas of the Great Lakes;
  (5) populations of sea lamprey are expanding their range to new streams
  and tributaries, due in part to improved water pollution control, and are
  going untreated, thus causing an increase in reproduction and the number
  of sea lampreys;
  (6) in Lakes Huron, Ontario, and Superior, equal numbers of lake trout
  are being killed by sea lamprey as are being taken by fisherman;
  (7) although the work of Dr. Vernon C. Applegate and others helped to assure
  that lampricides have minimal impacts on populations of non-target organisms,
  research on non-chemical alternatives to lampricide also is needed; and
  (8) an increased commitment to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission would
  drastically help to improve the quality of the Great Lakes Fishery by
  increasing the level of sea lamprey control.
  (b) AUTHORIZATION- Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated in section
  103(4) of this Act, $12,300,000 is authorized for each of the fiscal years
  1992 and 1993 for the purpose of enabling the Department of State to carry
  out its authority, function, duty, and responsibility in the conduct of
  foreign affairs of the United States in connection with the Great Lakes
  Fishery Commission.
SEC 169. INTER-AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS.
  (a) POLICY- Taking into consideration the long-term commitment by the United
  States to the affairs of this hemisphere and the need to build further
  upon the linkages between the United States and its neighbors, the Congress
  believes that the Secretary of State, in allocating the level of resources
  for the `International Organizations and Commissions' account, should pay
  particular attention to funding levels of the Inter-American organizations.
  (b) FINDING- The Congress finds that the work done by these organizations
  has been of great benefit to the region, and the United States itself has
  experienced a positive return from their efforts.
SEC. 170. HOUSING BENEFITS OF THE UNITED STATES MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS.
  (a) REVIEW- The Secretary of State shall direct the Assistant Secretary
  for International Organization Affairs to conduct a review and evaluation
  of policies and procedures for the provision of housing benefits (including
  leased housing, housing allowances, differential payments, or any comparable
  benefit) to United States Government personnel assigned to the United States
  Mission to the United Nations. Such review shall consider the December
  1989 recommendations of the Inspector General of the Department of State
  concerning housing benefits, and other recommendations as appropriate.
  (b) REPORT- Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of
  this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a comprehensive report
  of the findings of such review and evaluation to the Chairman of the
  Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Speaker of the House
  of Representatives. Such report shall include, but not be limited to--
  (1) a summary of all leased housing policy changes;
   (2) information concerning implementation of recommendations of the
   Inspector General for the Department of State, including an explanation
   for not implementing any recommendation made by the Inspector General; and
  (3) designation of positions at the United States Mission to the United
  Nations which require the incumbent to live in the Borough of Manhattan,
  and specific justification for such designation.

`TITLE IV--FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES HISTORICAL SERIES
`SEC. 401. GENERAL AUTHORITY AND CONTENTS OF PUBLICATION.
  `(a) CHARTER OF THE PUBLICATION- The Department of State shall continue
  to publish the `Foreign Relations of the United States' historical series
  (hereafter in this title referred to as the `FRUS series'), which shall
  be a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of major United
  States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic
  activity. Volumes of this publication shall include all records needed to
  provide a comprehensive documentation of the major foreign policy decisions
  and actions of the United States Government, including the facts which
  contributed to the formulation of policies and records providing supporting
  and alternative views to the policy position ultimately adopted.
  `(b) EDITING PRINCIPLES- The editing of records for preparation of the
  FRUS series shall be guided by the principles of historical objectivity
  and accuracy. Records shall not be altered and deletions shall not be made
  without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made. The
  published record shall omit no facts which were of major importance in
  reaching a decision, and nothing shall be omitted for the purpose of
  concealing a defect of policy.
  `(c) DEADLINE FOR PUBLICATION OF RECORDS- The Secretary of State shall
  ensure that the FRUS series shall be published not more than 30 years
  after the events recorded.
`SEC. 402. RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARATION OF THE FRUS SERIES.
  `(a) IN GENERAL- (1)(A) The Historian of the Department of State shall be
  responsible for the preparation of the FRUS series, including the selection
  of records, in accordance with the provisions of this title.
  `(B) The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation shall
  review and make recommendations to the Historian concerning the selection
  of records to be included in the FRUS series for purposes of improving the
  accuracy of the historical record which is made available to the public. In
  determining whether to recommend to the Historian that a record (or portion
  thereof) should be included in, or excluded from, the FRUS series, the
  Advisory Committee shall consider whether the publication of that record
  or portion would demonstrably impede current diplomatic negotiations or
  other ongoing official activities of the United States Government.
  `(2) Other departments, agencies, and other entities of the United States
  Government shall cooperate with the Office of the Historian by providing
  full and complete access to the records pertinent to United States foreign
  policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records
  in accordance with the procedures developed under section 403, except
  that no access to any record, and no provision of any copy of a record,
  shall be required in the case of any record that was prepared less than
  26 years before the date of a request for such access or copy made by the
  Office of the Historian.
  `(b) NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION- Notwithstanding any
  other provision of this title, the requirement for the National Archives
  and Records Administration to provide access to, and copies of, records to
  the Department of State for the FRUS series shall be governed by chapter
  21 of title 44, United States Code, by any agreement concluded between the
  Department of State and the National Archives and Records Administration,
  and, in the case of Presidential records, by section 2204 of such title.
`SEC. 403. PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING RECORDS FOR THE FRUS SERIES;
DECLASSIFICATION, REVISIONS, AND SUMMARIES.
  `(a) DEVELOPMENT OF PROCEDURES- Not later than 180 days after the date
  of enactment of this title, each department, agency, or other entity
  of the United States Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
  execution, or support shall develop procedures for its historical office (or
  a designated individual in the event that there is no historical office)--
  `(1) to coordinate with the State Department's Office of the Historian in
  selecting records for possible inclusion in the FRUS series; and
  `(2) to permit full access to the original, unrevised records by such
  individuals holding appropriate security clearances employed by the
  State Department's Office of the Historian as have been designated by
  the Secretary of State as liaison to that department, agency, or entity,
  for purposes of this title.
  `(b) DECLASSIFICATION REVIEW- (1) Subject to paragraph (4), records selected
  by the Historian for inclusion in the FRUS series shall be submitted to the
  respective originating agency for declassification review in accordance with
  that agency's procedures for such review, except that such declassification
  review shall be completed by the originating agency within 60 days after
  such records are submitted for review. If the originating agency determines
  that any such record is not declassifiable because of a continuing need to
  protect sources and methods for the collection of intelligence information
  or to protect other sensitive national security information, then the
  originating agency shall attempt to make such deletions in the text as
  will make the record declassifiable.
  `(2)(A) If the Historian determines that the meaning of a record is so
  altered or changed by deletions made under paragraph (1) that the FRUS
  series in that condition would be misleading or lead to an inaccurate
  or incomplete historical record, then the Historian shall request the
  originating agency to prepare an unclassified summary of the record.
  `(B) The Historian shall inform the Advisory Committee of any failure by
  an originating agency to complete its declassification review of a record
  within 60 days and of any request made of an originating agency under
  subparagraph (A).
  `(3)(A) The Advisory Committee shall have full and complete access to the
  original text of any record in which deletions have been made or for which
  an unclassified summary has been prepared.

  list of the records described in subparagraph (A).
  `(C) For purposes of any law or regulation governing access to classified
  records, a member of the Advisory Committee seeking access under this
  paragraph to a record shall be deemed to have a need to know.
  `(4)(A) If the originating agency refuses to prepare a declassified record
  or to prepare an unclassified summary, or if the Advisory Committee does
  not agree with the deletions made in the record or with the accuracy of
  the summary, then the Advisory Committee shall submit to the Secretary of
  State a report setting forth the refusal of the agency or the disagreement
  by the Advisory Committee, as the case may be. The Advisory Committee shall
  determine the time and manner of submission of such report. The Advisory
  Committee shall furnish to the originating agency a copy of the report
  submitted to the Secretary of State.
  `(B) Within 30 days after receiving a copy of the Advisory Committee's
  report, the originating agency shall--
  `(i) declassify the record, or
  `(ii) if necessary--
  `(I) declassify the record with deletions that are acceptable to the
  Advisory Committee,
  `(II) prepare an unclassified summary, or
  `(III) furnish to the Secretary of State an explanation of its reasons for
  refusing to declassify the record or for failing to provide an unclassified
  summary.

  later than 30 years after the record was prepared, shall be transferred
  to the National Archives and Records Administration, and shall be made

  of the United States or reveal sensitive information relating to the design
  of United States or foreign military equipment or relating to United States
  cryptologic systems or activities;
  `(2) would disclose the names or identities of living persons who provided
  confidential information to the United States and would pose a substantial
  risk of harm to such persons;
  `(3) would demonstrably impede current diplomatic negotiations or other
  ongoing official activities of the United States Government; or
  `(4) would disclose matters that are related solely to the internal
  personnel rules and practices of the Department of State or are contained
  in personnel, medical, or similar files the disclosure of which would
  constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
  `(c) REVIEW- The Advisory Committee shall review--
  `(1) the State Department's declassification procedures,
  `(2) all guidelines used in declassification, including those guidelines
  provided to the National Archives and Records Administration which are in

  provide significant opportunities for Americans to study and live in Western

TITLE V--ANTI-BOYCOTT PASSPORT ACT OF 1991
SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.
  This title may be cited as the `Anti-Boycott Passport Act of 1991'.
SEC. 502. FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds, as follows:
  (1) The nations of the Arab League except Egypt remain in a state of
  war with Israel, a friend and ally of the United States, and refuse to
  recognize Israel and her right to exist.
  (2) As part of their effort to isolate Israel and her allies, the majority
  of Arab countries generally reject the passports of, and deny entrance
  visas to, private persons and governmental officials whose passport or
  other documents bear an Israeli entrance stamp or marking or otherwise
  reflect that the person has visited Israel.
  (3) The passport visa policy of the majority of Arab League nations is an
  impediment to peace in the Middle East and must be reversed.
  (4) The passport and visa policy of the majority of Arab League nations
  is an affront to the Government of the United States.
  (5) The passport and visa policy of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, both members
  of the Arab League, demonstrates a business as usual attitude and lack of
  appreciation for the successful efforts of the United States to reverse
  the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and to restore the security of Kuwait and
  Saudi Arabia.
  (6) Officials of the United States Government traveling in the Middle East
  are, as a general practice, issued two passports so that they can travel
  to Israel and to Arab countries in compliance with the passport and visa
  policy of the majority of Arab League nations.
  (7) To avoid challenging the passport and visa policy of the majority of
  Arab League nations the State Department has issued official passports to
  United States Government officials, designated for travel only to Israel.
  (8) The United States Government's policy of issuing two passports for
  official travel in the Middle East, and its policy of issuing official
  passports designated for travel only to Israel, constitute acquiescence
  in, and the appearance of acceptance of, the rejection of Israel by Arab
  countries.
  (9) The United States Government's policy of issuing two passports for
  official travel in the Middle East, and its policy of issuing official
  passports designated for travel only to Israel, are at odds both with the
  recognition of Israel by the United States and with the rejection in United
  States policy and law of the Arab boycott of Israel.
  (10) The reversal of the passport and visa policy described above would
  be an important confidence-building measure and would contribute to the
  peace process in the Middle East.
  (11) The Administration should vigorously encourage the nations of the
  Arab League which maintain the passport and visa policy described in this
  section to reverse their policy of rejecting passports of, and denying
  entrance visas to, persons whose passport or other documents reflect that
  the person has visited Israel.
SEC. 503. PURPOSE.
  It is the purpose of this Act--
  (1) to direct the Secretary of State to seek an end to the policy of
  the majority of Arab League nations of rejecting passports, and denying
  entrance visas to persons whose passport or other documents reflect that
  the holder has visited Israel, and to secure the adoption of policies
  that assure that the travel to such Arab League nations by persons who
  have visited Israel shall not be unreasonably impeded; and
  (2) to prohibit United States Government acquiescence in the policy of
  the majority of Arab League nations of rejecting Israel by rejecting
  passports of, and denying entrance visas to, persons whose passport or
  other documents reflect that the holder has visited Israel, especially
  with respect to travel by officials of the United States.
SEC. 504. NEGOTIATIONS.
  The Secretary of State shall immediately instruct the United States Middle
  Eastern diplomatic corps to seek an end to the policy of the majority of
  Arab League nations of rejecting passports of, and denying entrance visas
  to, private persons and officials of all nations whose passports or other
  documents reflect that the holder thereof has visited Israel.
SEC. 505. REPORT TO CONGRESS.
  The Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on Foreign
  Relations and Appropriations of the Senate, and the Committees on Foreign
  Affairs and Appropriations of the House of Representatives within sixty
  days of the date of enactment of this Act. The report shall describe the
  status of efforts to secure an end to the passport and visa policy of the
  majority of Arab League nations as described in section 504, and describe
  the prospects that such efforts would be successful within ninety days of
  the date of enactment of this Act.
SEC. 506. PROHIBITION ON THE ISSUANCE OF ISRAEL-ONLY PASSPORTS.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of State shall
  not issue any passport that is designated for travel only to Israel. Within
  ninety days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State
  shall cancel any passport already issued which is designated for travel
  only to Israel.
SEC. 507. POLICY OF NONACQUIESCENCE.
  (a) REQUIREMENT OF SINGLE PASSPORT- The Secretary of State shall not
  issue more than one official or diplomatic passport to any official of
  the United States Government for the purpose of enabling that official
  to acquiesce in or comply with the policy of the majority of Arab League
  nations of rejecting passports of, or denying entrance visas to, persons
  whose passport or other documents reflect that the person has visited Israel.
  (b) IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY OF NONCOMPLIANCE- The Secretary of State
  shall promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to assure that
  officials of the United States Government do not comply with, or acquiesce
  in, the policy of the majority of Arab League nations of rejecting passports
  of, or denying entrance visas to, persons whose passport or other documents
  reflect that the person has visited Israel.
  (c) EFFECTIVE DATE- This section shall take effect within ninety days of
  the date of enactment of this Act, except that, if the Secretary of State
  fails to conduct negotiations pursuant to section 504 or to submit a report
  under section 505, this Act shall take effect on the date of such refusal.

PART A--LAOTIAN-AMERICAN RELATIONS
SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.
  This part may be cited as the `Laotian-American Relations Act'.
SEC. 602. FINDINGS AND POLICY.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) the United States has maintained diplomatic relations with the Government
  of Laos since 1950;
  (2) the Laotian Government has recently enacted broad-based free market
  economic reforms, including privitization of state enterprises and
  decollectivization of the agricultural sector, and is accelerating efforts
  to adopt a legal system, including commercial laws based on Western legal
  precepts, with the assistance of Harvard Law School;
  (3) the Laotian Government has substantially improved its assistance to
  the United States in the recovery of American prisoners of war and missing
  in action from the Vietnam War; and
  (4) the Laotian Government has increased its cooperation in the reduction
  of opium production and the interdiction of drug trafficking, recently
  providing unprecedented access to remote areas to United States Customs
  officials, granting multiple entry visas to Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
  personnel, and agreeing in principle to a joint law enforcement project
  between DEA and the United States Customs Service.
  (b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that the
  President, in recognition of the constructive changes taking place in
  Laos, should--
  (1) upgrade the current American diplomatic representation in Vientiane,
  Laos, from Charge d'Affaires to the level of Ambassador;
  (2) ensure that an American military attache is permanently assigned to
  the United States mission in Vientiane to assist the recovery of American
  prisoners of war and missing in action; and
  (3) ensure that Drug Enforcement Agency personnel are permanently assigned
  to the United States mission in Vientiane for the purpose of accelerating
  cooperative efforts in narcotics eradication and interdiction.
SEC. 603. ESTABLISHMENT OF USIA OFFICE IN VIENTIANE, LAOS.
  The Director of the United States Information Agency shall establish

  Vietnamese Act'.
SEC. 612. SCHOLARSHIPS FOR VIETNAMESE.

  of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Information
  Agency shall make available, during fiscal year 1992, 15 scholarships
  for Vietnamese residents in Vietnam to study in the United States. Each
  scholarship made available under this subsection shall be for not less
  than one semester of study in a United States college or university.
  (b) PREFERENCE IN AWARDING SCHOLARSHIPS- In awarding scholarships under
  this section, preference shall be given to candidates intending to pursue
  studies in economics and commercial law.
PART C--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
SEC. 621. POLICY ON RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM AND
CAMBODIA.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) it is United States policy to promote democracy and open, competitive
  markets in a world community increasingly receptive to such ideals;
  (2) the presence of American citizens, media, and commodities helped
  to foster the emergence of democracy and free market systems within East
  European nations and among East European citizens in their struggle against
  communist rule;
  (3) it is a priority of United States policy to resolve finally the nearly
  2,300 missing-in-action (MIA) and prisoner-of-war (POW) cases from the
  Vietnam War;
  (4) direct contact with, and increased access by, American citizens in
  Vietnam through humanitarian and business endeavors could serve to assist
  in the resolution of POW/MIA cases through increased access to Vietnam;
  (5) the Cambodian people confront a continuing threat from the Khmer
  Rouge and a severe economic crisis, including shortages of food, fuel,
  and fertilizer;
  (6) the United States has maintained a complete economic embargo against
  Vietnam and Cambodia since April 1975, prohibiting all United States
  financial transactions involving citizens of Vietnam and Cambodia or
  commodities from these two countries, as well as sales of commodities of
  American origin to Vietnam and Cambodia; and
  (7) such prohibitions unwisely restrict the free flow of western ideals
  of freedom, democracy, and free market systems.
  (b) STATEMENT OF POLICY- It is the sense of the Congress that the goals of
  United States policy in Vietnam and Cambodia would be advanced by increased
  access to their territories and by reaching an agreement that would result
  in the lifting of the trade embargo against Vietnam and Cambodia.
SEC. 622. POW/MIA STATUS.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) the United States is committed to resolving the fates of Americans
  unaccounted for in Southeast Asia as a matter of the highest national
  priority; and
  (2) the United States must consistently reaffirm that commitment and
  fulfill its promise to the families of the Americans unaccounted for in
  Southeast Asia.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that--
  (1) the United States should continue to give the highest national
  priority to accounting as fully as possible for Americans still missing
  or otherwise unaccounted for in Southeast Asia and to securing the return
  of any Americans who may still be held captive in Southeast Asia;
  (2) the United States should ensure that there is a viable, sustained
  process of joint cooperation with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and
  the Lao People's Democratic Republic to achieve credible answers for the
  families of America's servicemen and civilians who are missing or otherwise
  unaccounted for, including primary-next-of-kin access to all records and
  information resulting from the process of joint investigations, surveys,
  and excavations;
  (3) the United States should encourage and provide all necessary assistance
  to American veterans organizations, such as the American Legion, Veterans
  of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam Veterans of America, and to the families of
  POW/MIAs in their efforts in Vietnam to account for POW/MIAs;
  (4) General Vessey should be highly commended for his personal commitment
  to resolving the POW/MIA issue;
  (5) the United States should develop a means to obtain the fullest possible
  accounting for Americans who are listed as missing or otherwise unaccounted
  for in Cambodia, without placing this humanitarian objective into conflict
  with United States efforts to obtain an acceptable political settlement
  of the Cambodian situation; and
  (6) the United States should heighten responsible public awareness of the
  Americans still missing or otherwise unaccounted for in Southeast Asia
  through the dissemination of factual data.
TITLE VII--PERSIAN GULF WAR  CRIMINALS PROSECUTION ACT OF 1991
PART A--GENERAL PROVISIONS
SEC. 701.  SHORT TITLE.
  This title may be cited as the `Persian Gulf War Criminals Prosecution
  Act of 1991'.
SEC. 702.  FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held the initiation
  of a war of aggression to be `not only an international crime (but also)
  the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in
  that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole';
  (2) the United Nations has reaffirmed the principles of international law
  recognized by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal, and the judgments of
  the Tribunal;
  (3) the Charter of the United Nations imposes on its members the obligations
  to `refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force
  against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state'
  and to `settle their international disputes by peaceful means';
  (4) on August 2, 1990, and without provocation, Iraq initiated a war of
  aggression against the sovereign state of Kuwait;
  (5) the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
  Time of War (also known as the `Fourth Geneva Convention') imposes certain
  obligations upon a belligerent state, occupying another country by force of
  arms, in order to protect the civilian population of the occupied territory
  from some of the ravages of the conflict and requires that persons committing
  `grave breaches' are to be apprehended and subjected to trial;
  (6) `grave breaches' are defined to include `willful killing, torture,
  or inhuman treatment * * *, willfully causing great suffering or serious
  injury to body or health, taking of hostages and extensive destruction
  and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity';
  (7) there is evidence that Iraqi authorities have violated provisions of
  the Fourth Geneva Convention through their inhumane treatment and acts
  of violence against the Kuwaiti civilian population by subjecting Kuwaiti
  civilians to physical coercion, suffering, and extermination in order to
  obtain information, and by other actions;
  (8) both Iraq and Kuwait are parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention;
  (9) the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War
  (also known as the `Third Geneva Convention') sets forth standards for
  the treatment of civilians and incapacitated combatants during times of
  hostilities and requires that persons committing `grave breaches' are to
  be apprehended and subjected to trial;
  (10) there is evidence that Iraqi authorities have violated provisions
  of the Third Geneva Convention by their physical and psychological abuse
  of military and civilian prisoners of war, including members of the
  international press, by placing prisoners of war in solitary confinement,
  failing to shelter them against air bombardment, and denying them contact
  with the outside world, and by other actions;
  (11) Iraq is a party to the Third Geneva Convention;
  (12) there is evidence that Iraqi authorities committed crimes against
  peace by firing missiles on Israel with the intent of making it a party
  to war and with the intent of killing or injuring innocent civilians;
  (13) Iraq is a signator to the Convention on the Prohibition of Military
  or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, signed
  in Geneva, Switzerland on May 8, 1977, which provides in Article 1 that:
  Each State party to this Convention undertakes not to engage in military
  or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having
  widespread, long-lasting or severe effects as the means of destruction,
  damage or injury to any other State Party.' and there is evidence that
  Iraqi authorities, by inflicting grave risk to the health and well-being of
  innocent civilians in the region by willfully setting on fire Kuwaiti oil
  wells and willfully spilling oil into the Persian Gulf, resulting in the
  mass pollution of air and water, have committed crimes against the peace,
  in that such acts constitute engaging in military and other hostile uses
  of environmental modification techniques;
  (14) there is evidence that Iraqi authorities have violated, and continue
  to violate, international law, by using chemical and other illegal weapons
  against the citizens of Iraq, by shelling and bombing indiscriminately
  the cities and other civilian-populated regions of Iraq, by torturing and
  committing the summary killing of tens of thousands of Iraqi citizens,
  and by expelling through force and threats of force millions of Kurdish
  and Shi'a citizens of Iraq; and
  (15) Iraqi authorities who have committed crimes under international law
  must be prosecuted for committing such crimes because a failure to try and
  punish them would establish a dangerous precedent and would negatively
  impact the value of deterrence on the commission of future crimes under
  international law.
SEC. 703. DEFINITIONS.

TITLE VIII--ARMS SUPPLIERS REGIME
SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.
  This title may be cited as the `Arms Suppliers Regime Act of 1991'.
SEC. 802. FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) since the mid-1970's, the nations of the Middle East have imported
  more than $200 billion in conventional arms, most provided by the five
  permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Germany, Italy,
  Brazil, and Argentina;
  (2) according to the Director of Central Intelligence, many nations of
  the Middle East also now possess, or are seeking to possess, weapons of
  mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems;
  (3) the uncontrolled proliferation of advanced conventional and
  unconventional weapons threatens the security and stability of the Middle
  East and constitutes a debilitating diversion of the region's resources;
  (4) the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
  by acting jointly and in conjunction with other major arms supplier
  nations, could sharply curtail the transfer of unconventional and advanced
  conventional weapons to the Middle East;
  (5) leaders in several of these supplier nations have expressed a
  willingness to participate in a multilateral regime aimed at effecting
  such limitations; and
  (6) the United States can and should play a leadership role in creating
  such a multilateral regime.
SEC. 803. ARMS SUPPLIERS REGIME.
  (a) CONVENING OF ARMS SUPPLIERS CONFERENCE- The Secretary of State should
  undertake good faith efforts to convene a conference of representatives
  from the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the
  United Kingdom, France, and other appropriate nations to establish the
  arms suppliers regime as described in subsection (b).
  (b) PURPOSE OF ARMS SUPPLIERS REGIME- The purpose of such conference
  should be to establish an arms suppliers regime which, through exchanges
  of information and implementation of formal and informal arrangements, acts--
  (1) to halt the flow of unconventional arms, such as ballistic missiles,
  chemical weapons, biological weapons, and nuclear weapons, and technologies
  necessary to produce or assemble such arms, to all nations in the Middle
  East;
  (2) to limit and control the proliferation of advanced conventional arms
  to all nations in the Middle East; and
  (3) to provide incentives for regional arms control agreements in the
  Middle East by using all available means.
SEC. 804. ACTIONS BY ARMS SUPPLIERS REGIME.
  (a) HALTING PROLIFERATION OF UNCONVENTIONAL WEAPONS- In order to achieve
  the purposes described in section 803(b)(1), the United States should
  build on existing and future agreements among supplier nations by proposing
  that all members of the arms suppliers regime adopt as a matter of their
  national policy--
  (1) the limitations and controls contained in the Enhanced Proliferation
  Control Initiative;
  (2) the limitations and controls contained in the Missile Technology
  Control Regime (MTCR);
  (3) the guidelines followed by the Australia Group on chemical and biological
  arms proliferation;
  (4) the guidelines adopted by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (the London
  Group); and
  (5) other appropriate controls that serve to halt the flow of unconventional
  weapons to the Middle East.
  (b) CONTROLLING PROLIFERATION OF ADVANCED CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS- In order

  (1) following the defeat of Iraqi military forces, the military alliance

  by a joint multilateral commitment by arms supplier nations to establish
  and rigorously enforce a prohibition on the introduction into the region
  of advanced conventional arms capable of altering this balance; and
  (3) the United States could and should demonstrate its commitment to
  the creation of an effective arms suppliers regime by challenging other

  moratorium affecting the transfer of all such advanced conventional arms.

SEC. 909. CHINA'S ILLEGAL CONTROL OF TIBET.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) Tibet has maintained throughout its history a distinctive national,
  cultural, and religious identity separate from that of China;
  (2) Chinese archival documents and traditional dynastic histories,
  including those pertaining to periods of Manchu and Mongol rule, never
  refer to Tibet being made `an integral part' of China;
  (3) several countries including Mongolia, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, India,
  Japan, Great Britain, Czarist Russia and the United States recognized
  Tibet as an independent nation or dealt with Tibet independently of any
  Chinese Government;
  (4) the United States respected Tibet's neutrality in the Second World War,
  and the emissaries sent in 1942 by President Roosevelt on a diplomatic
  mission to the Tibetan Government traveled on documents issued directly
  by the Tibetan Foreign Ministry;
  (5) in 1949-50, China launched an armed invasion of Tibet in contravention
  of international law;
  (6) at the time of the Chinese occupation, Tibet possessed all the attributes
  of statehood under international law including a defined territory and
  population, an independent government, and the ability to conduct domestic
  affairs and independent international relations, as found in 1960 by the
  International Commission of Jurists;
  (7) the United States State Department in December 1950, condemned China's
  aggression in Tibet and affirmed the Tibetan people's `inherent right
  . . . to have the determining voice in its political destiny';
  (8) in 1959, the United States State Department again condemned China's
  aggression in Tibet and the dissolution of `the legitimate Tibetan
  Government' and stated that `the United States has never recognized the
  pretensions to sovereignty over Tibet put forward by the Chinese Communist
  regime';
  (9) in 1959, members of the Tibetan Government including the head of state,
  the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, sought political asylum in India following a
  national uprising against the Chinese occupying forces, and established
  a government in exile which continues to operate today and is recognized
  by the Tibetan people as the only legitimate Government of Tibet;
  (10) it is the policy of the United States to oppose aggression and other
  illegal uses of force by one country against the sovereignty of another as
  a manner of acquiring territory, and to condemn violations of international
  law, including the illegal occupation of one country by another;
  (11) the United States actively supported Tibet in the United Nations in
  both condemning China and calling for Tibet's right to self-determination
  in General Assembly Resolutions 1353 (1959), 1723 (1961), and 2079 (1965);
  (12) on December 16, 1961, at the United Nations, United States Ambassador
  Plimpton said `The Chinese Communists have invaded Tibet in force. They have
  forcibly overthrown the legally constituted Government of Tibet headed by
  the Dalai Lama' and that `the United States believes that our objectives
  must include the restoration of the human rights of the Tibetan people
  and of their national right of self-determination';
  (13) on December 17, 1965, at the United Nations, United States Ambassador
  Goldberg stated in debating the question of Tibet that `The people of
  America, born in freedom, must obviously be repelled by any act of aggression
  . . . perpetrated by a large State against a small and weak one. . .' and
  that `Tibet has been reduced to political and economic impotence,' and that
  `We are therefore called upon in this bitter hour to concern ourselves
  with the suffering of those who have lost their country. . .';
  (14) China's illegal occupation of Tibet continues to this day; and
  (15) the United States should not condone aggression by accepting China's
  claim to sovereignty over Tibet.
  (b) POLICY- It is the sense of the Congress that Tibet, including those
  areas incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu,
  and Quinghai, is an occupied country under the established principles of
  international law whose true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the
  Tibetan Government in exile as recognized by the Tibetan people.
SEC. 910. RELEASE OF PRISONERS HELD IN IRAQ.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) the United States, as the world's foremost democracy, was at the
  forefront of the United Nations' effort to liberate Kuwait from the hand
  of a destructive tyrant, Saddam Hussein;
  (2) the American people are deeply committed to the liberation of those
  held against their will by the Government of Iraq;
  (3) reports indicate the Government of Iraq still holds more than 4,000
  prisoners within Iraq, of whom the predominance are Kuwaitis, but also
  include Bangladeshis, Egyptians, Iraqis, Jordanians, Lebanese, Palestinians,
  and Sudanese;
  (4) Of the thousands detained in Kuwait, reports indicate many are children;
  (5) all those still held as prisoners in Iraq deserve to be liberated from
  the grip of Saddam Hussein; and
  (6) the Government of Iraq should release immediately the thousands
  of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and civilian residents detained during its
  occupation of Kuwait.
  (b) SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ-
  (1) In addition to other requirements of law, the President shall not
  lift United States economic sanctions currently in place against Saddam
  Hussein's regime in Iraq until the regime has released all prisoners of
  war and accounted as fully as possible for all those missing in action,
  including those Kuwaiti citizens and other Kuwaiti residents captured or
  detained by Iraq.
  (2) In addition to other requirements of United Nations Security
  Council Resolutions, the President shall make every effort to ensure the
  multinational coalition maintains the full range of economic sanctions
  against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq until the regime has released all
  prisoners of war and accounted as fully as possible for all those missing
  in action, including those Kuwaiti citizens and other Kuwaiti residents
  captured or detained by Iraq.
  (c) REPORT ON DETAINEES- The Secretary of State shall maintain a detailed
  list of all Kuwaiti citizens and other Kuwaiti residents believed to have
  been captured or detained by the Government of Iraq, and shall report to
  the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and to the
  Speaker of the House of Representatives within 180 days after enactment
  of this Act on actions taken and actions planned to effect the release of
  the remaining prisoners.'.

  global climate change have been adopted with United States support in
  international meetings;
  (3) all nations need to participate in international responses to climate

  emissions in an equitable manner by all nations of the world;
  (7) meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework
  Convention on Climate Change are underway; and
  (8) strong leadership is crucial to making meaningful progress on global
  warming in time for the United Nations Conference on Environment and
  Development, to be held in Brazil in June 1992.
  (b) POLICY- It is the sense of the Senate regarding negotiations taking
  place in the Intergovernmental Negotiation Committee that the framework
  convention should seek to provide for--
  (1) improved coordination of research activities and monitoring of global
  climate change;
  (2) adoption of measures that are justified for a variety of reasons and
  which also have the effect of limiting or adapting to any adverse effects
  of climate change;
  (3) establishment of national strategies to address climate change and to
  make public accounting of the elements of such strategy and the effect on
  net emissions;
  (4) a net stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000;
  (5) establishment of verifiable goals for net reduction of greenhouse
  gases by each nation in an equitable manner; and

SEC. 912. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING HONG KONG.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong faces a crucial period of
  transition in the years prior to 1997, when the territory will revert to
  the control of the People's Republic of China;
  (2) Britain's leadership has promoted a period of unprecedented prosperity
  for the colony and created a global trade and financial center, accompanied
  by a political system providing a high degree of civil liberties and
  personal freedoms but without self-governance;
  (3) respected British political leaders have called for a more fully
  representative government in Hong Kong before 1997; and
  (4) China's commitment to leaving in place the current social and economic
  system after 1997 has been called into question by the proposed `Basic
  Law' which will govern Hong Kong after 1997 and by China's treatment of
  its own peaceful dissidents at Tiananmen Square.
  (b) POLICY- It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should
  encourage the Government of the United Kingdom to provide the people of
  Hong Kong all possible civil liberties, including popular election of
  the territory's Legislative Council, so that it will bequeath a fully
  functioning, self-governing democracy to China in 1997.
SEC. 913. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TAIWAN.
  It is the sense of Congress that--
  (1) Taiwan's economic dynamism is a tribute to the success of the
  postwar United States assistance program and to Taiwan's commitment to an
  international system of free trade;
  (2) Taiwan's economic growth has made it in recent years an indispensable
  part of regional and international networks of trade, investment, and
  finance; and
  (3) the United States should support Taiwan's interest in playing a role
  in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and Asia Pacific
  Economic Cooperation (APEC), two organizations in which Taiwan's role in
  the world economy gives it a legitimate right to participate.
SEC. 914. POLICY ON MIDDLE EAST ARMS SALES.
  In recognition of the particular volatility of the Middle East, the
  tremendous cost in human lives and suffering in the aftermath of the
  aggression by Iraq, and the imperative that stability be maintained in the
  region while the course toward lasting peace is pursued, the authority
  to make sales under the Arms Export Control Act or to furnish military
  assistance under chapter 2 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
  shall be exercised with regard to the Middle East only for the objectives
  set forth in subsection 501(b) of such Act and as follows:
  (1) to transfer defense articles and services only to those nations that
  have given reliable assurances that such articles will be used only for
  internal security, for legitimate self-defense, to permit the recipient
  country to participate in regional or collective arrangements or measures
  consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, or otherwise to permit
  the recipient country to participate in collective measures requested by
  the United Nations for the purpose of maintaining or restoring international
  peace and security;
  (2) to transfer defense articles and services to nations in the region only
  after it has been determined that such transfers will not contribute to an
  arms race, will not increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of
  conflict and will not prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral
  arms control arrangements;
  (3) to take all appropriate steps to ensure that each nation of the Middle
  East that is a recipient of United States defense articles and services--
  (A) affirms the right of all nations in the region to exist within safe
  and secure borders; and
  (B) supports or is engaged in direct regional peace negotiations; and
  (4) with the agreement of other suppliers, to prohibit the introduction of
  newly developed advanced defense articles and services that would create
  new and significantly higher combat capabilities in the region.
SEC. 915. GUARANTEES FOR COMMERCIAL DEFENSE EXPORTS.
  Section 24 of the Arms Export Control Act is amended by adding the following
  new subsection:
  `(d)(1) In order to enhance the ability of United States exporters to compete
  on an equal footing with exporters of other countries, the President may
  extend guarantees under the authority of this subsection in connection with
  the commercial sale of defense articles and services to NATO countries,
  Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel. The aggregate amount guaranteed
  hereunder in any fiscal year may not exceed $1,000,000,000.
  `(2) In extending medium- and long-term guarantees for commercial sales
  pursuant to paragraph (1), the President shall not offer terms and
  conditions more beneficial than would be provided by the Export-Import
  Bank of the United States under similar circumstances in conjunction with
  the provision of guarantees for nondefense articles and services.
  `(3) Section 653 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall not apply to
  funds appropriated to carry out this subsection. In addition, section 634A
  of that Act and any similar provision of law shall apply to the obligation
  of funds to carry out this subsection only with respect to guarantees,
  in particular cases of amounts exceeding $20,000,000.
  `(4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each of fiscal years 1992
  and 1993 $63,500,000 for the subsidy cost of the guarantees authorized
  under this subsection.
  `(5) The authorities of this subsection may be exercised only to such
  extent and in such amounts as provided for in advance in appropriations acts.
  `(6) Applications for guarantees issued under this subsection shall
  be submitted to the Secretary of State, who is authorized to make
  such arrangements as necessary with other agencies, including with the
  Export-Import Bank of the United States, to process these applications
  and otherwise to implement this subsection.
  `(7)(A) A fee shall be charged for each guarantee issued under this
  subsection.
  `(B) All fees collected in connection with guarantees issued under this
  subsection shall be available to offset the cost of guarantee obligations
  under this subsection.
  `(C) All of the fees referred to in this paragraph, together with earnings
  on those fees and other income arising from guarantee operations under
  this subsection, shall be held in a financing account maintained in the
  Treasury of the United States. All funds in such account may be invested in
  obligations of the United States. Any interest or other receipts derived
  from such investments shall be credited to such account and may be used
  for the purposes specified in subparagraph (B).
