JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States authorizing
the Congress and the States to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag
of the United States.
Whereas the Flag of the United States of America is a national symbol of
such stature that it must be kept inviolate;
Whereas the physical desecration of the Flag should not be considered
constitutionally protected speech; and
Whereas physical desecration may include, but is not limited to, such acts
as burning, mutilating, defacing, defiling or trampling on the Flag, or
displaying the Flag in a contemptuous manner: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring
  therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the
  Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and
  purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of
  three-fourths of the several States within seven years after the date of
  its submission for ratification:
`Article --
  `The Congress and the States shall have power to prohibit the physical
  desecration of the Flag of the United States.'. HOLLINGS, Mrs. KASSEBAUM,
