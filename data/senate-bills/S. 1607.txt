                  TITLE I--PUBLIC SAFETY AND POLICING

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Public Safety Partnership and 
Community Policing Act of 1993''.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) according to data compiled by the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, in 1961, there was approximately 1 reported 
        violent crime per city police officer, but while from 1961 to 
        1991 there was no substantial increase in United States cities' 
        police employment rate, during the same period the number of 
        reported violent crimes per city police officer rose to 
        approximately 4.6 per officer;
            (2) National Crime Survey figures indicate that nearly 
        5,000,000 households in the United States had at least 1 member 
        who had been a victim of violent crime during 1991;
            (3) these victims of violence experienced more than 
        6,400,000 crimes of which about one-half were reported to law 
        enforcement authorities;
            (4) community-oriented policing (``cops on the beat'') 
        enhances communication and cooperation between law enforcement 
        and members of the community;
            (5) such communication and cooperation between law 
        enforcement and members of the community significantly assists 
        in preventing and controlling crime and violence, thus 
        enhancing public safety; and
            (6) while increasing and maintaining police resources and 
        presence in the community are the long-term responsibility of 
        State and local governments, State and local law enforcement 
        agencies are in need of immediate assistance to begin the 
        process of rehiring officers who have been laid off for 
        budgetary reasons and hiring new, additional officers to assist 
        in the implementation of community-oriented policing.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--
            (1) substantially increase the number of law enforcement 
        officers interacting directly with members of the community 
        (``cops on the beat'');
            (2) provide additional and more effective training to law 
        enforcement officers to enhance their problem solving, service, 
        and other skills needed in interacting with members of the 
        community;
            (3) encourage the development and implementation of 
        innovative programs to permit members of the community to 
        assist State and local law enforcement agencies in the 
        prevention of crime in the community; and
            (4) encourage the development of new technologies to assist 
        State and local law enforcement agencies in reorienting the 
        emphasis of their activities from reacting to crime to 
        preventing crime,
by establishing a program of grants and assistance in furtherance of 
these objectives, including the authorization for a period of 6 years 
of grants for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law 
enforcement officers.

        offense, as determined beyond a reasonable doubt at the hearing 
        under section 3593, constitutes an attempt to intentionally 
        kill the President of the United States and results in bodily

                connection with a person, other than one of the

                to a person, other than one of the participants in the 
                offense, such that participation in the act constituted 
                a reckless disregard for human life and the victim died 
                as a direct result of the act,
shall be sentenced to death if, after consideration of the factors set 
forth in section 3592 in the course of a hearing held pursuant to 
section 3593, it is determined that imposition of a sentence of death 
is justified, except that no person may be sentenced to death who was 
less than 18 years of age at the time of the offense.
``Sec. 3592. Mitigating and aggravating factors to be considered in 
              determining whether a sentence of death is justified
    ``(a) Mitigating Factors.--In determining whether a sentence of 
death is to be imposed on a defendant, the finder of fact shall 
consider any mitigating factor, including the following:
            ``(1) Impaired capacity.--The defendant's capacity to 
        appreciate the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct or to 
        conform conduct to the requirements of law was significantly 
        impaired, regardless of whether the capacity was so impaired as 
        to constitute a defense to the charge.
            ``(2) Duress.--The defendant was under unusual and 
        substantial duress, regardless of whether the duress was of 
        such a degree as to constitute a defense to the charge.
            ``(3) Minor participation.--The defendant is punishable as 
        a principal in the offense, which was committed by another, but 
        the defendant's participation was relatively minor, regardless 
        of whether the participation was so minor as to constitute a 
        defense to the charge.
            ``(4) Equally culpable defendants.--Another defendant or 
        defendants, equally culpable in the crime, will not be punished 
        by death.
            ``(5) No prior criminal record.--The defendant did not have 
        a significant prior history of other criminal conduct.
            ``(6) Disturbance.--The defendant committed the offense 
        under severe mental or emotional disturbance.
            ``(7) Victim's consent.--The victim consented to the 
        criminal conduct that resulted in the victim's death.
            ``(8) Other factors.--Other factors in the defendant's 
        background, record, or character or any other circumstance of 
        the offense that mitigate against imposition of the death 
        sentence.
    ``(b) Aggravating Factors for Espionage and Treason.--In 
determining whether a sentence of death is justified for an offense 
described in section 3591(1), the jury, or if there is no jury, the 
court, shall consider each of the following aggravating factors for 
which notice has been given and determine which, if any, exist:
            ``(1) Prior espionage or treason offense.--The defendant 
        has previously been convicted of another offense involving 
        espionage or treason for which a sentence of either life 
        imprisonment or death was authorized by law.
            ``(2) Grave risk to national security.--In the commission 
        of the offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of 
        substantial danger to the national security.
            ``(3) Grave risk of death.--In the commission of the 
        offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death 
        to another person.
The jury, or if there is no jury, the court, may consider whether any 
other aggravating factor for which notice has been given exists.
    ``(c) Aggravating Factors for Homicide and for Attempted Murder of 
the President.--In determining whether a sentence of death is justified 
for an offense described in section 3591 (2) or (3), the jury, or if 
there is no jury, the court, shall consider each of the following 
aggravating factors for which notice has been given and determine 
which, if any, exist:
            ``(1) Death during commission of another crime.--The death, 
        or injury resulting in death, occurred during the commission or 
        attempted commission of, or during the immediate flight from 
        the commission of, an offense under section 32 (destruction of 
        aircraft or aircraft facilities), section 33 (destruction of 
        motor vehicles or motor vehicle facilities), section 36 
        (violence at international airports), section 351 (violence

        of institution or officer), section 794 (gathering or

        (wrecking trains), section 2280 (maritime violence), section 
        2281 (maritime platform violence), section 2332 (terrorist acts 
        abroad against United States nationals), section 2339 (use of 
        weapons of mass destruction), or section 2381 (treason) of this 
        title, or section 902 (i) or (n) of the Federal Aviation Act of 
        1958 (49 U.S.C. 1472 (i) or (n)) (aircraft piracy).

            ``(3) Previous conviction of offense for which a sentence 
        of death or life imprisonment was authorized.--The defendant 
        has previously been convicted of another Federal or State

        defendant has previously been convicted of 2 or more Federal or 
        State offenses, punishable by a term of imprisonment of more

        infliction of, or attempted infliction of, serious bodily 
        injury or death upon another person.
            ``(5) Grave risk of death to additional persons.--The 
        defendant, in the commission of the offense, or in escaping 
        apprehension for the violation of the offense, knowingly 
        created a grave risk of death to 1 or more persons in addition 
        to the victim of the offense.
            ``(6) Heinous, cruel, or depraved manner of committing 
        offense.--The defendant committed the offense in an especially

other aggravating factor for which notice has been given exists.
``Sec. 3593. Special hearing to determine whether a sentence of death 
              is justified
    ``(a) Notice by the Government.--If, in a case involving an offense 
described in section 3591, the attorney for the government believes 
that the circumstances of the offense are such that a sentence of death 
is justified under this chapter, the attorney shall, a reasonable time 
before the trial or before acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty, 
sign and file with the court, and serve on the defendant, a notice--
            ``(1) stating that the government believes that the 
        circumstances of the offense are such that, if the defendant is 
        convicted, a sentence of death is justified under this chapter 
        and that the government will seek the sentence of death; and
            ``(2) setting forth the aggravating factor or factors that 
        the government, if the defendant is convicted, proposes to 
        prove as justifying a sentence of death.
The factors for which notice is provided under this subsection may 
include factors concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and 
the victim's family, and may include oral testimony, a victim impact 
statement that identifies the victim of the offense and the extent and 
scope of the injury and loss suffered by the victim and the victim's 
family, and any other relevant information. The court may permit the 
attorney for the government to amend the notice upon a showing of good 
cause.
    ``(b) Hearing Before a Court or Jury.--If the attorney for the 
government has filed a notice as required under subsection (a) and the 
defendant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to an offense described 
in section 3591, the judge who presided at the trial or before whom the 
guilty plea was entered, or another judge if that judge is unavailable, 
shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the punishment 
to be imposed. The hearing shall be conducted--
            ``(1) before the jury that determined the defendant's 
        guilt;
            ``(2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of the 
        hearing if--
                    ``(A) the defendant was convicted upon a plea of 
                guilty;
                    ``(B) the defendant was convicted after a trial 
                before the court sitting without a jury;
                    ``(C) the jury that determined the defendant's 
                guilt was discharged for good cause; or
                    ``(D) after initial imposition of a sentence under 
                this section, reconsideration of the sentence under 
                this section is necessary; or
            ``(3) before the court alone, upon the motion of the 
        defendant and with the approval of the attorney for the 
        government.
A jury impaneled pursuant to paragraph (2) shall consist of 12 members, 
unless, at any time before the conclusion of the hearing, the parties 
stipulate, with the approval of the court, that it shall consist of a 
lesser number.
    ``(c) Proof of Mitigating and Aggravating Factors.--Notwithstanding 
rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, when a defendant 
is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense under section 3591, no 
presentence report shall be prepared. At the sentencing hearing, 
information may be presented as to any matter relevant to the sentence, 
including any mitigating or aggravating factor permitted or required to 
be considered under section 3592. Information presented may include the 
trial transcript and exhibits if the hearing is held before a jury or 
judge not present during the trial. The defendant may present any 
information relevant to a mitigating factor. The government may present 
any information relevant to an aggravating factor for which notice has 
been provided under subsection (a). The government and the defendant 
shall be permitted to rebut any information received at the hearing, 
and shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to the 
adequacy of the information to establish the existence of any 
aggravating or mitigating factor, and as to the appropriateness in the 
case of imposing a sentence of death. The government shall open the 
argument. The defendant shall be permitted to reply. The government 
shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The burden of 
establishing the existence of any aggravating factor is on the 
government, and is not satisfied unless the existence of such a factor 
is established beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden of establishing 
the existence of any mitigating factor is on the defendant, and is not 
satisfied unless the existence of such a factor is established by a 
preponderance of the information.
    ``(d) Return of Special Findings.--The jury, or if there is no 
jury, the court, shall consider all the information received during the 
hearing. It shall return special findings identifying any aggravating 
factor or factors set forth in section 3592 found to exist and any 
other aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under 
subsection (a) found to exist. A finding with respect to a mitigating 
factor may be made by 1 or more members of the jury, and any member of 
the jury who finds the existence of a mitigating factor may consider 
such factor established for purposes of this section regardless of the 
number of jurors who concur that the factor has been established. A 
finding with respect to any aggravating factor must be unanimous. If no 
aggravating factor set forth in section 3592 is found to exist, the 
court shall impose a sentence other than death authorized by law.
    ``(e) Return of a Finding Concerning a Sentence of Death.--If, in 
the case of--
            ``(1) an offense described in section 3591(1), an 
        aggravating factor required to be considered under section 
        3592(b) is found to exist; or
            ``(2) an offense described in section 3591 (2) or (3), an 
        aggravating factor required to be considered under section 
        3592(c) is found to exist,
the jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall consider whether all 
the aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh 
all the mitigating factor or factors found to exist to justify a 
sentence of death, or, in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether 
the aggravating factor or factors alone are sufficient to justify a 
sentence of death. Based upon this consideration, the jury by unanimous 
vote, or if there is no jury, the court, shall recommend whether the 
defendant should be sentenced to death, to life imprisonment without 
possibility of release or some other lesser sentence. The jury or the 
court, if there is no jury, regardless of its findings with respect to 
aggravating and mitigating factors, is never required to impose a death 
sentence and the jury shall be so instructed.
    ``(f) Special Precaution To Ensure Against Discrimination.--In a 
hearing held before a jury, the court, prior to the return of a finding 
under subsection (e), shall instruct the jury that, in considering 
whether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not consider the 
race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the 
defendant or of any victim and that the jury is not to recommend a 
sentence of death unless it has concluded that it would recommend a 
sentence of death for the crime in question no matter what the race, 
color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or 
of any victim may be. The jury, upon return of a finding under 
subsection (e), shall also return to the court a certificate, signed by 
each juror, that consideration of the race, color, religious beliefs, 
national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim was not involved 
in reaching his or her individual decision and that the individual 
juror would have made the same recommendation regarding a sentence for 
the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious 
beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim may be.
``Sec. 3594. Imposition of a sentence of death
    ``Upon a recommendation under section 3593(e) that the defendant 
should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility 
of release, the court shall sentence the defendant accordingly. 
Otherwise, the court shall impose any lesser sentence that is 
authorized by law. Notwithstanding any other law, if the maximum term 
of imprisonment for the offense is life imprisonment, the court may 
impose a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release.
``Sec. 3595. Review of a sentence of death
    ``(a) Appeal.--In a case in which a sentence of death is imposed, 
the sentence shall be subject to review by the court of appeals upon 
appeal by the defendant. Notice of appeal must be filed within the time 
specified for the filing of a notice of appeal. An appeal under this 
section may be consolidated with an appeal of the judgment of 
conviction and shall have priority over all other cases.
    ``(b) Review.--The court of appeals shall review the entire record 
in the case, including--
            ``(1) the evidence submitted during the trial;
            ``(2) the information submitted during the sentencing 
        hearing;
            ``(3) the procedures employed in the sentencing hearing; 
        and
            ``(4) the special findings returned under section 3593(d).
    ``(c) Decision and Disposition.--
            ``(1) The court of appeals shall address all substantive 
        and procedural issues raised on the appeal of a sentence of 
        death, and shall consider whether the sentence of death was 
        imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other 
        arbitrary factor and whether the evidence supports the special 
        finding of the existence of an aggravating factor required to 
        be considered under section 3592.
            ``(2) Whenever the court of appeals finds that--
                    ``(A) the sentence of death was imposed under the 
                influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary 
                factor;
                    ``(B) the admissible evidence and information 
                adduced does not support the special finding of the 
                existence of the required aggravating factor; or
                    ``(C) the proceedings involved any other legal 
                error requiring reversal of the sentence that was 
                properly preserved for appeal under the rules of 
                criminal procedure,

this chapter, the court shall not announce or apply a new rule to grant

        beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to 
        proscribe or prohibits the imposition of a certain type of 
        punishment for a class of persons because of their status or 
        offense; or

        procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of 
        the criminal proceeding.

the constitutional or statutory standards that prevailed at the time 
the petitioner's conviction and sentence became final on direct 
appeal.''.

section, shall review de novo the rulings of a State court on matters 
of Federal law, including the application of Federal law to facts, 
regardless of whether the opportunity for a full and fair hearing on 
such Federal questions has been provided in the State court. In the 
case of a violation that can be harmless, the State shall bear the 
burden of proving harmlessness.''.

SEC. 305. LIMITS ON SUCCESSIVE PETITIONS.

    Section 2244(b) of title 28, United States Code, is amended to read 
as follows:
    ``(b)(1) A claim presented in a habeas corpus petition that was not 
timely presented in a prior petition shall be dismissed unless--
            ``(A) the petitioner shows that--
                    ``(i) the failure to raise the claim previously was 
                the result of interference by State officials with the 
                presentation of the claim, in violation of the 
                Constitution or laws of the United States;
                    ``(ii) the claim relies on a new rule that is 
                applicable under section 2257 and was previously 
                unavailable; or
                    ``(iii) the factual predicate for the claim could 
                not have been discovered previously through the 
                exercise of reasonable diligence; and
            ``(B) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed 
        in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to--
                    ``(i) undermine the court's confidence in the 
                factfinder's determination of the applicant's guilt of 
                the offense or offenses for which the sentence was 
                imposed; or
                    ``(ii) demonstrate that no reasonable sentencing 
                authority would have found an aggravating circumstance 
                or other condition of eligibility for a capital or 
                noncapital sentence, or otherwise would have imposed a 
                sentence of death.
    ``(2) Notwithstanding other matters pending before the court, 
claims for relief under this subsection from a case in which a sentence 
of death was imposed shall receive a prompt review in a manner 
consistent with the interests of justice.''.

SEC. 306. NEW EVIDENCE.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 153 of title 28, United States Code, as 
amended by section 304(a)(1), is amended by adding at the end the 
following new section:
``Sec.  2256. Capital cases; new evidence
    ``For purposes of this chapter, a claim arising from a violation of 
the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States shall include 
a claim by a person under sentence of death that is based on factual 
allegations that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a 
whole, would be sufficient to demonstrate that no reasonable factfinder 
would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense or that no 
reasonable sentencing authority would have found an aggravating 
circumstance or other condition of eligibility for the sentence. Such a 
claim shall be dismissed if the facts supporting the claim were 
actually known to the petitioner during a prior stage of the litigation 
in which the claim was not raised. Notwithstanding any other provision 
of this chapter, the claim shall not be subject to section 2244(b) or 
the time requirements established by section 2242. In all other 
respects, the claim shall be subject to the rules applicable to claims 
under this chapter.''.

applicant under sentence of death shall have a right of appeal without

SEC. 308. PROVISION OF COUNSEL.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 153 of title 28, United States Code, as 
amended by section 304(a)(1), is amended by adding at the end the 
following new section:
``Sec.  2258. Counsel in capital cases; State court
    ``(a) Finding and Declaration.--The Congress finds that inadequate 
representation in State capital trials, appeals and post-conviction 
proceedings increases unacceptably the risk of constitutional and 
factual error. The possibility of such errors puts into question the 
validity of individual convictions and the conformity of State criminal 
justice systems with the commands of the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. The Congress therefore determines that the 
following requirements are a necessary and appropriate means, pursuant 
to its authority under section 5 of that Amendment, of enforcing the 
Due Process Clause.
    ``(b) Counsel.--(1) A State in which a sentence of death may be 
imposed under State law shall provide legal services to--
            ``(A) indigents charged with offenses for which capital 
        punishment is sought;
            ``(B) indigents who have been sentenced to death and who 
        seek appellate, post-conviction, or unitary review in State 
        court; and
            ``(C) indigents who have been sentenced to death and who 
        seek certiorari review of State court judgments in the United 
        States Supreme Court.
    ``(2) This section shall not apply or form a basis for relief to 
nonindigents.
    ``(c) Counsel Certification Authority.--A State in which a sentence 
of death may be imposed under State law shall, within 180 days after 
the date of enactment of this subsection, establish a State counsel 
certification authority, which shall be comprised of members of the bar 
with substantial experience in, or commitment to, the representation of 
criminal defendants in capital cases, and shall be comprised of a 
balanced representation from each segment of the State's criminal 
defense bar, such as a statewide defender organization, a capital case 
resource center, local public defender's offices and private attorneys 
involved in criminal trial, appellate, post-conviction, or unitary 
review practice. If a State fails to establish a counsel certification 
authority within 180 days after the date of enactment of this 
subsection, a private cause of action may be brought in Federal 
district court to enforce this subsection by any aggrieved party, 
including a defendant eligible for appointed representation under this 
subsection or a member of an organization eligible for representation 
on the counsel certification authority. If the court finds that the 
State has failed to establish a counsel certification authority as 
required by this subsection, the court shall grant appropriate 
injunctive and declaratory relief, except that the court shall not 
grant relief that disturbs any criminal conviction or sentence, 
obstructs the prosecution of State criminal proceedings, or alters 
proceedings arising under this chapter.
    ``(d) Duties of Authority; Certification of Counsel.--The counsel 
certification authority shall--
            ``(1) establish and publish standards governing 
        qualifications of counsel, which shall include--
                    ``(A) knowledge and understanding of pertinent 
                legal authorities regarding issues in capital cases;

                condition of capital clients, and the preparation and 
                writing of legal papers in capital cases;

        (e), additional resources (such as an affiliation with a 
        publicly funded defender organization) and experience that 
        enable them to provide quality legal representation comparable

        established pursuant to paragraph (1);

        and resources that enable them to provide quality legal

hourly rates for the compensation of attorneys. In such an action, the

a claim of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.

        law enforcement record system and notify the appropriate law 
        enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the person expects 
        to reside. The State law enforcement agency shall also

       Subtitle C--National Commission to Support Law Enforcement

SEC. 1721. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Commission to Support 
Law Enforcement Act''.

SEC. 1722. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) law enforcement officers risk their lives daily to 
        protect citizens, for modest rewards and too little 
        recognition;
            (2) a significant shift has occurred in the problems that 
        law enforcement officers face without a corresponding change in 
        the support from the Federal Government;
            (3) law enforcement officers are on the front line in the 
        war against drugs and crime;
            (4) the rate of violent crime continues to increase along 
        with the increase in drug use;
            (5) a large percentage of individuals arrested test 
        positive for drug usage;
            (6) the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the 
        Administration of Justice of 1965 focused attention on many 
        issues affecting law enforcement, and a review twenty-five 
        years later would help to evaluate current problems, including 
        drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased 
        funding; and
            (7) a comprehensive study of law enforcement issues, 
        including the role of the Federal Government in supporting law 
        enforcement officers, working conditions, and responsibility 
        for crime control would assist in redefining the relationships 
        between the Federal Government, the public, and law enforcement 
        officials.

Act''.

SEC. 1902. MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this section, the Attorney General shall develop, in 
cooperation with the States, a national voluntary motor vehicle theft 
prevention program (in this section referred to as the ``program'') 
under which--
            (1) the owner of a motor vehicle may voluntarily sign a 
        consent form with a participating State or locality in which 
        the motor vehicle owner--
                    (A) states that the vehicle is not normally 
                operated under certain specified conditions; and
                    (B) agrees to--
                            (i) display program decals or devices on 
                        the owner's vehicle; and
                            (ii) permit law enforcement officials in 
                        any State to stop the motor vehicle and take 
                        reasonable steps to determine whether the 
                        vehicle is being operated by or with the 
                        permission of the owner, if the vehicle is 
                        being operated under the specified conditions; 
                        and
            (2) participating States and localities authorize law 
        enforcement officials in the State or locality to stop motor 
        vehicles displaying program decals or devices under specified 
        conditions and take reasonable steps to determine whether the 
        vehicle is being operated by or with the permission of the 
        owner.
    (b) Uniform Decal or Device Designs.--
            (1) In general.--The motor vehicle theft prevention program 
        developed pursuant to this section shall include a uniform 
        design or designs for decals or other devices to be displayed 
        by motor vehicles participating in the program.
            (2) Type of design.--The uniform design shall--
                    (A) be highly visible; and
                    (B) explicitly state that the motor vehicle to 
                which it is affixed may be stopped under the specified 
                conditions without additional grounds for establishing 
                a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle is being 
                operated unlawfully.
    (c) Voluntary Consent Form.--The voluntary consent form used to 
enroll in the program shall--
            (1) clearly state that participation in the program is 
        voluntary;
            (2) clearly explain that participation in the program means 
        that, if the participating vehicle is being operated under the 
        specified conditions, law enforcement officials may stop the 
        vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether it is 
        being operated by or with the consent of the owner, even if the 
        law enforcement officials have no other basis for believing 
        that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully;
            (3) include an express statement that the vehicle is not 
        normally operated under the specified conditions and that the 
        operation of the vehicle under those conditions would provide 
        sufficient grounds for a prudent law enforcement officer to 
        reasonably believe that the vehicle was not being operated by 
        or with the consent of the owner; and
            (4) include any additional information that the Attorney 
        General may reasonably require.
    (d) Specified Conditions Under Which Stops May Be Authorized.--
            (1) In general.--The Attorney General shall promulgate 
        rules establishing the conditions under which participating 
        motor vehicles may be authorized to be stopped under this 
        section. These conditions may not be based on race, creed, 
        color, national origin, gender, or age. These conditions may 
        include--
                    (A) the operation of the vehicle during certain 
                hours of the day; or
                    (B) the operation of the vehicle under other 
                circumstances that would provide a sufficient basis for 
                establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle 
                was not being operated by the owner, or with the 
                consent of the owner.
            (2) More than one set of conditions.--The Attorney General 
        may establish more than one set of conditions under which 
        participating motor vehicles may be stopped. If more than one 
        set of conditions is established, a separate consent form and a 
        separate design for program decals or devices shall be 
        established for each set of conditions. The Attorney General 
        may choose to satisfy the requirement of a separate design for 
        program decals or devices under this paragraph by the use of a 
        design color that is clearly distinguishable from other design 
        colors.
            (3) No new conditions without consent.--After the program 
        has begun, the conditions under which a vehicle may be stopped 
        if affixed with a certain decal or device design may not be 
        expanded without the consent of the owner.
            (4) Limited participation by states and localities.--A 
        State or locality need not authorize the stopping of motor 
        vehicles under all sets of conditions specified under the 
        program in order to participate in the program.
    (e) Motor Vehicles for Hire.--
            (1) Notification to lessees.--Any person who is in the 
        business of renting or leasing motor vehicles and who rents or 
        leases a motor vehicle on which a program decal or device is 
        affixed shall, prior to transferring possession of the vehicle, 
        notify the person to whom the motor vehicle is rented or leased 
        about the program.
            (2) Type of notice.--The notice required by this subsection 
        shall--
                    (A) be in writing;
                    (B) be in a prominent format to be determined by 
                the Attorney General; and
                    (C) explain the possibility that if the motor 
                vehicle is operated under the specified conditions, the 
                vehicle may be stopped by law enforcement officials 
                even if the officials have no other basis for believing 
                that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully.
            (3) Fine for failure to provide notice.--Failure to provide 
        proper notice under this subsection shall be punishable by a 
        fine not to exceed $5,000.

ensure that law enforcement officials throughout the State or locality 
are familiar with the program, and with the conditions under which 
motor vehicles may be stopped under the program.
    (g) Regulations.--The Attorney General shall promulgate regulations 
to implement this section.

in conduct constituting an offense under section 1033 and, upon proof

be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each 
violation or the amount of compensation which the person received or

        statements with section 3553(f) of title 18, United States 
        Code, as added by subsection (a), and promulgate policy 
        statements to assist the courts in interpreting that provision;
            (2) shall review the consideration of defendants' criminal 
        histories under the guidelines and make such amendments to the 
        sentencing guidelines and policy statements as the Commission 
        determines necessary and appropriate to ensure that--
                    (A) defendants with significant criminal histories 
                resulting from foreign convictions are sentenced 
                commensurate with the seriousness of their prior 
                criminal records to the extent that consideration of 
                such foreign convictions is constitutional and 
                practical;
                    (B) defendants with juvenile adjudications 
                involving significant acts of misconduct are sentenced 
                commensurate with the seriousness of such misconduct to

                practical and relevant to the purposes of sentencing; 
                and
                    (C) the assignment to a defendant of a single 
                criminal history point adequately reflects the 
                seriousness of such a defendant's prior criminal 
                conduct; and
            (3) may promulgate any such amendments under the procedures 
        set forth in section 21(a) of the Sentencing Act of 1987 
        (Public Law 100-182; 101 Stat. 1271), as though the authority 
        under that section had not expired.

Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993''.

SEC. 2702. TITLE 18 AMENDMENT.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 55 (relating to kidnapping) of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
section:
``Sec. 1204. International parental kidnapping
    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section--
            ```child' means a person who has not attained the age of 16 
        years.
            ```parental rights', with respect to a child, means the 
        right to physical custody of the child--
                    ``(A) whether joint or sole (and includes visiting 
                rights); and
                    ``(B) whether arising by operation of law, court 
                order, or legally binding agreement of the parties.
    ``(b) Offense.--A person who removes a child from the United States 
or retains a child (who has been in the United States) outside the 
United States with intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental 
rights shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 3 
years, or both.
    ``(c) Affirmative Defenses.--It shall be an affirmative defense 
under this section that--
            ``(1) the defendant acted within the provisions of a valid 
        court order granting the defendant legal custody or visitation 
        rights, and that order was obtained pursuant to the Uniform 
        Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and was in effect at the time of 
        the offense;
            ``(2) the defendant was fleeing an incidence or pattern of 
        domestic violence; or
            ``(3) the defendant had physical custody of the child 
        pursuant to a court order granting legal custody or visitation 
        rights and failed to return the child as a result of 
        circumstances beyond the defendant's control, and the defendant 
        notified or made reasonable attempts to notify the other parent 
        or lawful custodian of the child of such circumstances within 
        24 hours after the visitation period had expired and returned 
        the child as soon as possible.
    ``(d) Rule of Construction.--This section does not detract from The 
Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Parental Child 
Abduction, done at The Hague on October 25, 1980.''.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that, 
inasmuch as use of the procedures under The Hague Convention on the 
Civil Aspects of International Parental Child Abduction has resulted in 
the return of many children, those procedures, in circumstances in 
which they are applicable, should be the option of first choice for a 
parent who seeks the return of a child who has been removed from the 
parent.
    (c) Technical Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter 55 of 
title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new item:

``1204. International parental kidnapping.''.

              PARENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION.

SEC. 2967. BALANCE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) an adequately supported Federal judiciary is essential 
        to the enforcement of law and order in the United States,
            (2) section 331 of title 28 provides in pertinent part that 
        the Chief Justice shall submit to Congress an annual report of 
        the proceedings of the Judicial Conference and its 
        recommendations for legislation,
            (3) in 1990, in response to the recommendations of the 
        Judicial Conference for additional judgeships, Congress enacted 
        legislation creating 85 additional judgeships with an effective 
        date of December 1, 1990,
            (4) during the previous administration, it took an average 
        of 502 days from the time a judgeship became vacant until such 
        vacancy was filled,
            (5) the enactment of legislation providing additional 
        funding for the investigation and prosecution facets of the 
        criminal justice system has a direct and positive impact on the 
        needs and workload of the Judiciary, which is already severely 
        overloaded with criminal cases,
            (6) recommendations by the Judicial Conference for the 
        filling of judicial vacancies are currently made on the basis 
        of historical data alone,
            (7) the General Accounting Office, pursuant to the 1988 
        Anti-Drug Abuse Act, has developed a computer model that 
        measures the potential effect of fiscal increases on one or 
        more parts of the criminal justice system on the Judiciary,
            (8) the General Accounting Office has established that an 
        increase in the resources allocated to the investigative and 
        prosecutorial parts of the criminal justice system, brings 
        about an increase in the number of criminal cases filed, which 
        in turn adds to the need for additional judgeships,
            (9) the allocation of resources to portions of the Federal 
        criminal justice system other than the Judiciary contributes to 
        the need for additional judgeships that cannot be anticipated 
        by the use of historical data alone, and
            (10) the use of historical data alone, because of its 
        inability to project the need for additional judgeships 
        attributable to the increase in criminal caseload adds to the 
        delay in meeting the needs of the Judiciary.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Judicial Conference should be encouraged to make its recommendations to 
Congress for additional judgeships utilizing historical data and a 
workload estimate model designed to anticipate an increase in criminal 
filings resulting from increased funding in one or more components of 
the Federal criminal justice system, and to take into account the time 
expended in the appointive and confirmation process.

    ``(1) The Congress finds and declares that--
            ``(A) crime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, 
        is a pervasive, nationwide problem;
            ``(B) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the 
        interstate movement of drugs, guns, and criminal gangs;
            ``(C) firearms and ammunition move easily in interstate 
        commerce and have been found in increasing numbers in and 
        around schools, as documented in numerous hearings in both the 
        Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and 
        Judiciary Committee of the Senate;
            ``(D) in fact, even before the sale of a firearm, the gun, 
        its component parts, ammunition, and the raw materials from 
        which they are made have considerably moved in interstate 
        commerce;
            ``(E) while criminals freely move from State to State, 
        ordinary citizens and foreign visitors may fear to travel to or 
        through certain parts of the country due to concern about 
        violent crime and gun violence, and parents may decline to send 
        their children to school for the same reason;
            ``(F) the occurrence of violent crime in school zones has 
        resulted in a decline in the quality of education in our

        adverse impact on interstate commerce and the foreign commerce 
        of the United States;
            ``(H) States, localities, and school systems find it almost 
        impossible to handle gun-related crime by themselves; even 
        States, localities, and school systems that have made strong 
        efforts to prevent, detect, and punish gun-related crime find 
        their efforts unavailing due in part to the failure or 
        inability of other States or localities to take strong 
        measures; and
            ``(I) Congress has power, under the interstate commerce 
        clause and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact 
        measures to ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation's
