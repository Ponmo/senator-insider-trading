Whereas on October 21, 1993, Senator Bob Packwood was duly served by the Select

        forthwith certain documents to the Committee;
Whereas Senator Bob Packwood has refused to comply as directed by the subpoena;
Whereas under sections 703(b) and 705 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,

Whereas the Senate will have a continuing interest in the documents required to 
        be produced by the subpoena until its final disposition of allegations 
        of misconduct by Senator Bob Packwood before the Select Committee on 
        Ethics: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel shall bring a civil action
