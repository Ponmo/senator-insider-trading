SEC. 331. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DEPOT MAINTENANCE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) the Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the 
        Air Force reflects the essential requirements for the Air Force 
        to maintain a ready and controlled source of organic technical 
        competence, thereby ensuring an effective and timely response 
        to national defense contingencies and emergency requirements;
            (2) since the publication of the Depot Maintenance Strategy 
        and Master Plan of the Air Force in 2002, the service has made 
        great progress toward modernizing all three of its Depots, in 
        order to maintain their status as ``world class'' maintenance 
        repair and overhaul operations;
            (3) one of the indispensable components of the Depot 
        Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the Air Force is the 
        commitment of the Air Force to allocate $150,000,000 a year 
        over six years, beginning in fiscal year 2004, for 
        recapitalization and investment, including the procurement of 
        technologically advanced facilities and equipment, of our 
        Nation's three Air Force depots; and
            (4) the funds expended to date have ensured that 
        transformation projects, such as the initial implementation of 
        ``Lean'' and ``Six Sigma'' production techniques, have achieved 
        great success in reducing the time necessary to perform depot 
        maintenance on aircraft.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Air Force should be commended for the 
        implementation of its Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master 
        Plan and, in particular, meeting its commitment to invest 
        $150,000,000 a year over 6 years, since fiscal year 2004, in 
        the Nation's 3 Air Force Depots; and
            (2) the Air Force should continue to fully fund its 
        commitment of $150,000,000 a year through fiscal year 2009 in 
        investments and recapitalization projects pursuant to the Depot 
        Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan.

SEC. 523. REPORT ON INFORMATION ON STOP LOSS AUTHORITIES GIVEN TO 
              ENLISTEES IN THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense began retaining selected 
        members of the Armed Forces beyond their contractual date of 
        separation from the Armed Forces, a policy commonly known as 
        ``stop loss'', shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, 
        and for the first time since Operation Desert Shield/Desert 
        Storm.
            (2) The Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force discontinued 
        their use of stop loss authority in 2003. According to the 
        Department of Defense, a total of 8,992 marines, 2,600 sailors, 
        and 8,500 airmen were kept beyond their separation dates under 
        that authority.
            (3) The Army is the only Armed Force currently using stop 
        loss authority. The Army reports that, during September 2005, 
        it was retaining 6,929 regular component soldiers, 3,002 
        soldiers in the National Guard, and 2,847 soldiers in the Army 
        Reserve beyond their separation date. The Army reports that it 
        has not kept an account of the cumulative number of soldiers 
        who have been kept beyond their separation date.
            (4) The Department of Defense Form 4/1, Enlistment/
        Reenlistment Document does not give notice to enlistees and 
        reenlistees in the regular components of the Armed Forces that 
        they may be kept beyond their contractual separation date 
        during times of partial mobilization.
            (5) The Department of Defense has an obligation to clearly 
        communicate to all potential enlistees and reenlistees in the 
        Armed Forces their terms of service in the Armed Forces.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall 
        submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the 
        actions being taken to ensure that each individual being 
        recruited for service in the Armed Forces is provided, before 
        making a formal enlistment in the Armed Forces, precise and 
        detailed information on the period or periods of service to 
        which such individual may be obligated by reason of enlistment 
        in the Armed Forces, including any revisions to Department of 
        Defense Form 4/1.

        include--
                    (A) a description of how the Department informs 
                enlistees in the Armed Forces on--

                        and the manner in which exercise of such 
                        authority could affect the duration of an 
                        individual's service on active duty in the 
                        Armed Forces;
                            (ii) the authority for the call or order to 
                        active duty of members of the Individual Ready 
                        Reserve and the manner in which such a call or 
                        order to active duty could affect an individual 
                        following the completion of the individual's 
                        expected period of service on active duty or in 
                        the Individual Ready Reserve; and
                            (iii) any other authorities applicable to 
                        the call or order to active duty of the 
                        Reserves, or of the retention of members of the 
                        Armed Forces on active duty, that could affect 
                        the period of service of an individual on 
                        active duty or in the Armed Forces; and
                    (B) such other information as the Secretary 
                considers appropriate.

efficient shall not be considered a new requirement for the purpose of 
the competition requirements in subparagraph (A) or the requirements 
for public-private competition in Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-76.
    ``(C) A function performed by more than 10 Federal Government 
employees may not be separated into separate functions for the purposes 
of avoiding the competition requirement in subparagraph (A) or the 
requirements for public-private competition in Office of Management and 
Budget Circular A-76.

public-private competition under subparagraph (A) in specific instances 
if--

        Defense or the relevant Assistant Secretary of Defense, 
        Secretary of a military department, or head of a Defense 
        Agency;
            ``(ii) the written waiver is accompanied by a detailed 
        determination that national security interests preclude 
        compliance with the requirement for a public-private 
        competition; and
            ``(iii) a copy of the waiver is published in the Federal 
        Register within 10 working days after the date on which the

                performed by Federal Government employees at any time 
                on or after October 1, 1980; or

a defense acquisition and support workforce of such larger size.
    (2) During fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Secretary of 
Defense may realign any part of the defense acquisition and support

        support workforce that the Secretary of Defense identifies as 
        being higher priority positions that are staffed at levels not 
        likely to ensure efficient and effective performance of all of 
        the responsibilities of those positions.
    (d) Strategic Assessment and Plan.--(1) The Secretary of Defense 
shall--
            (A) assess the extent to which the Department of Defense

SEC. 904. AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The mission of the American Forces Radio and Television 
        Service (AFRTS) and its American Forces Network (AFN), a 
        worldwide radio and television broadcast network, is to deliver 
        command information by providing United States military 
        commanders overseas and at sea with a broadcast media that 
        effectively communicates information to personnel under their 
        commands, including information from the Department of Defense, 
        information from the Armed Forces, and information unique to 
        the theater and localities in which such personnel are 
        stationed or deployed.
            (2) The American Forces Radio and Television Service and 
        the American Forces Network provide a ``touch of home'' to 
        members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of the 
        Department of Defense, and their families stationed at bases 
        and at embassies and consulates in more than 179 countries, as 
        well as Navy, Coast Guard, and Military Sealift Command ships 
        at sea, by providing the same type and quality of radio and 
        television programming (including news, information, sports, 
        and entertainment) that would be available in the continental 
        United States. Additionally, the American Forces Network plays 
        an important role in enabling military commanders to 
        disseminate official information to members of the Armed Forces 
        and their families, thus making popularity and acceptance key 
        factors in ensuring effective communication.
            (3) It is American Forces Radio and Television Service and 
        American Forces Network policy that, except for the Pentagon 
        Channel service, programming is acquired from distributors of 
        the most popular television program airing in the continental 
        United States. Much of the programming is provided at no cost 
        to the United States Government. The remainder of the 
        programming is provided at less-than-market rates to cover 
        distributors' costs and obligations. Depending on the audience 
        segment or demographic targeted, programs that perform well are 
        acquired and scheduled to maximize audiences for internal and 
        command information exposure.
            (4) American Forces Radio and Television Service and 
        American Forces Network select programming that represents a 
        cross-section of popular American radio and television, 
        tailored toward the worldwide audience of the American Forces 
        Radio and Television Service and the American Forces Network. 
        Schedules emulate programming practices in the United States, 
        and programs are aired in accordance with network broadcast 
        standards. Specifically, policy on programming seeks--
                    (A) to provide balance and diversity;
                    (B) to deliver a cross-section of popular 
                programming;
                    (C) to target appropriate demographics; and
                    (D) to maintain network broadcast standards.
            (5) The ``Voice Channel'', or radio programming, of the 
        American Forces Radio and Television Service and American 
        Forces Network is chosen to address requirements specified by 
        the military broadcasting services and the detachment 
        commanders of their affiliate radio stations. American Forces 
        Network Radio makes a best faith effort to obtain the top-rated 
        program of its sort at the time of selection, at no cost to the 
        United States Government. American Forces Network Radio usually 
        retains a scheduled program until it is no longer produced, too 
        few American Forces Network affiliates choose to schedule the 
        program locally, or a similar program so thoroughly dominates 
        its audience in the United States that the American Forces 
        Radio and Television Service switches to this program to offer 
        the higher rated show to the overseas audience.
            (6) American Forces Network Radio personnel review the 
        major trade publications to monitor announcements of new 
        programs, follow the ratings of established programs, and keep 
        aware of programming trends. When a program addressing a need 
        identified by a Military Broadcasting Service or an American 
        Forces Network affiliate becomes available to the American 
        Forces Network, or a program seems especially worthy of 
        consideration, American Forces Network Radio informs the 
        affiliates and supplies samples to gauge affiliate interest. If 
        affiliates commit to broadcasting the new show, American Forces 
        Network Radio seeks to schedule it.
            (7) The managers of the American Forces Radio and 
        Television Service continually update their programming options 
        and, in November 2005, decided to include additional programs 
        that meet the criteria that American Forces Radio and 
        Television Service managers apply to such decisions, and that, 
        consistent with American Forces Radio and Television Service 
        and American Forces Network procedures, local programmers at 33 
        locations around the globe decide which programs actually are 
        broadcast. American Forces Radio and Television Service have 
        consistently sought to provide a broad, high quality range of 
        choices for local station managers.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the men and women of the American Forces Radio and 
        Television Service and the Armed Forces Network should be 
        commended for providing a vital service to the military 
        community worldwide; and
            (2) the programming mission, themes, and practices of the 
        Department of Defense with respect to its television and radio 
        programming have fairly and responsively fulfilled their 
        mission of providing a ``touch of home'' to members of the 
        Armed Forces and their families around the world and have 
        contributed immeasurably to high morale and quality of life in 
        the Armed Forces.
    (c) Authority To Appoint Ombudsman as Intermediary.--The Secretary 
of Defense may appoint an individual to serve as ombudsman of the 
American Forces Network. Any ombudsman so appointed shall act as an 
intermediary between the staff of the American Forces Network and the 
Department of Defense, military commanders, and listeners to the 
programming of the American Forces Network.

        of Defense for Management; and
            (4) the experience of any other Federal agencies that have 
        instituted similar management positions.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, a Deputy Secretary of Defense 
for Management is an official who--
            (1) serves as the Chief Management Officer of the 
        Department of Defense;
            (2) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on 
        matters relating to the management of the Department of 
        Defense, including defense business activities, to ensure 
        Department-wide capability to carry out the strategic plan of 
        the Department of Defense in support of national security 
        objectives; and
            (3) takes precedence in the Department of Defense 
        immediately after the Deputy Secretary of Defense.

                                any member of the board of directors)

                        logistical support.
    (c) Support for Scout Jamborees.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
                    (A) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of 
                the United States commits exclusively to Congress the 
                powers to raise and support armies, provide and 
                maintain a Navy, and make rules for the government and 
                regulation of the land and naval forces.
                    (B) Under those powers conferred by section 8 of 
                article I of the Constitution of the United States to 
                provide, support, and maintain the Armed Forces, it 
                lies within the discretion of Congress to provide 
                opportunities to train the Armed Forces.
                    (C) The primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to 
                defend our national security and prepare for combat 
                should the need arise.
                    (D) One of the most critical elements in defending 
                the Nation and preparing for combat is training in 
                conditions that simulate the preparation, logistics, 
                and leadership required for defense and combat.
                    (E) Support for youth organization events simulates 
                the preparation, logistics, and leadership required for 
                defending our national security and preparing for 
                combat.
                    (F) For example, Boy Scouts of America's National 
                Scout Jamboree is a unique training event for the Armed 
                Forces, as it requires the construction, maintenance, 
                and disassembly of a ``tent city'' capable of 
                supporting tens of thousands of people for a week or 
                longer. Camporees at the United States Military Academy 
                for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts provide similar training 
                opportunities on a smaller scale.
            (2) Support.--Section 2554 of title 10, United States Code, 
        is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(i)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least the same 
level of support under this section for a national or world Boy Scout 
Jamboree as was provided under this section for the preceding national 
or world Boy Scout Jamboree.
    ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1), if the 
Secretary--
            ``(A) determines that providing the support subject to 
        paragraph (1) would be detrimental to the national security of 
        the United States; and
            ``(B) reports such a determination to the Congress in a 
        timely manner, and before such support is not provided.''.
    (d) Equal Access for Youth Organizations.--Section 109 of the 
Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5309) is 
amended--
            (1) in the first sentence of subsection (b) by inserting 
        ``or (e)'' after ``subsection (a)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) Equal Access.--
            ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `youth 
        organization' means any organization described under part B of 
        subtitle II of title 36, United States Code, that is intended 
        to serve individuals under the age of 21 years.
            ``(2) In general.--No State or unit of general local 
        government that has a designated open forum, limited public 
        forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of assistance 
        under this chapter shall deny equal access or a fair 
        opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any youth 
        organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or any group 
        officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, that 
        wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise participate in that 
        designated open forum, limited public forum, or nonpublic 
        forum.''.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Consistent with warhead levels agreed to in the Moscow 
        Treaty, the United States is modifying the capacity of the 
        Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from 
        its prior capability to carry up to 3 independent reentry 
        vehicles (RVs) to carry as few as a single reentry vehicle, a 
        process known as downloading.
            (2) A series of Department of Defense studies of United 
        States strategic forces, including the 2001 Nuclear Posture 
        Review, has confirmed the continued need for 500 
        intercontinental ballistic missiles.
            (3) In a potential nuclear crisis it is important that the 
        nuclear weapons systems of the United States be configured so 
        as to discourage other nations from making a first strike.
            (4) The intercontinental ballistic missile force is 
        currently being considered as part of the deliberations of the 
        Department of Defense for the Quadrennial Defense Review.
    (b) Statement of United States Policy.--It is the policy of the 
United States to continue to deploy a force of 500 intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, provided that unanticipated strategic developments 
may compel the United States to make changes to this force structure in 
the future.
    (c) Moscow Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term ``Moscow 
Treaty'' means the Treaty Between the United States of America and the 
Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions, done at Moscow on

SEC. 1081. DRUG TRAFFICKING DETERRENCE.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) According to the Department of State, drug trafficking 
        organizations shipped approximately nine tons of cocaine to the 
        United States through the Dominican Republic in 2004, and are 
        increasingly using small, high-speed watercraft.
            (2) Drug traffickers use the Caribbean corridor to smuggle 
        narcotics to the United States via Puerto Rico and the 
        Dominican Republic. This route is ideal for drug trafficking 
        because of its geographic expanse, numerous law enforcement 
        jurisdictions and fragmented investigative efforts.
            (3) The tethered aerostat system in Lajas, Puerto Rico 
        contributes to deterring and detecting smugglers moving illicit 
        drugs into Puerto Rico. The aerostat's range and operational 
        capabilities allow it to provide surveillance coverage of the 
        eastern Caribbean corridor and the strategic waterway between 
        Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, known as the Mona 
        Passage.
            (4) Including maritime radar on the Lajas aerostat will 
        expand its ability to detect suspicious vessels in the eastern 
        Caribbean corridor.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--Given the above findings, it is the Sense 
of the Senate that--
            (1) Congress and the Department of Defense fully fund the 
        Counter-Drug Tethered Aerostat program.
            (2) Department of Defense install maritime radar on the 
        Lajas, Puerto Rico aerostat.

              (CROWS) PLATFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) With only a few systems deployed, the Common Remotely 
        Operated Weapons Station (CROWS) platform is already saving the 
        lives of soldiers today in Iraq by moving soldiers out of the 
        exposed gunner's seat and into the protective shell of an up-
        armored Humvee.
            (2) The Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station platform 
        dramatically improves battlefield awareness by providing a 
        laser rangefinder, night vision, telescopic vision, a fire 
        control computer that allows on-the-move target acquisition, 
        and one-shot one-kill accuracy at the maximum range of a 
        weapon.
            (3) As they become available, new technologies can be 
        incorporated into the Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station 
        platform, thus making the platform scalable.
            (4) The Army has indicated that an additional $206,000,000 
        will be required in fiscal year 2006 to procure 750 Common 
        Remotely Operated Weapons Station units for the Armed Forces, 
        and to prepare for future production of such weapons stations.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
President should include in the next request submitted to Congress for

sufficient funds for the production in fiscal year 2006 of a number of 
Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station units that is adequate to meet 
the requirements of the Armed Forces.

                disarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons programs

                underlying regional security problems in Northeast 
                Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, which would 
                facilitate non-proliferation and disarmament efforts in 
                those regions;
                    (G) to accelerate programs to safeguard and 
                eliminate nuclear weapons-usable material to the

                retain access to controlled materials and equipment 
                acquired for ``peaceful'' purposes;
                    (K) to accelerate implementation of disarmament

                fissile material; and

SEC. 1210. THE UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW 
              COMMISSION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China 
        Economic and Security Review Commission states that--
                    (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack 
                adequate disclosure standards, which creates the 
                potential for United States investors to unwittingly 
                contribute to enterprises that are involved in 
                activities harmful to United States security interests;
                    (B) United States influence and vital long-term 
                interests in Asia are being challenged by China's 
                robust regional economic engagement and diplomacy;
                    (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to 
                global ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and 
                ongoing;
                    (D) China's transfers of technology and components 
                for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their 
                delivery systems to countries of concern, including 
                countries that support acts of international terrorism, 
                has helped create a new tier of countries with the 
                capability to produce WMD and ballistic missiles;
                    (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo 
                against China that is currently under consideration in 
                the European Union would accelerate weapons 
                modernization and dramatically enhance Chinese military 
                capabilities;
                    (F) China is developing a leading-edge military 
                with the objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring 
                United States involvement in the Strait, and China's 
                qualitative and quantitative military advancements have 
                already resulted in a dramatic shift in the cross-
                Strait military balance toward China; and
                    (G) China's growing energy needs are driving China 
                into bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral 
                efforts to stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in 
                some cases may involve dangerous weapons transfers.
            (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress 
        approved a law that would authorize the use of force if Taiwan 
        formally declares independence.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Plan.--It is the sense of Congress that the President 
        should take immediate steps to establish a coherent and 
        comprehensive plan to address the emergence of China 
        economically, diplomatically, and militarily, to promote 
        mutually beneficial trade relations with China, and to 
        encourage China's adherence to international norms in the areas 
        of trade, international security, and human rights.
            (2) Contents.--The plan should contain the following:
                    (A) Actions to address China's policy of 
                undervaluing its currency, including--
                            (i) encouraging China to continue to 
                        upwardly revalue the Chinese yuan against the 
                        United States dollar;
                            (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a 
                        trade-weighted basket of currencies; and
                            (iii) concurrently encouraging United 
                        States trading partners with similar interests 
                        to join in these efforts.
                    (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade 
                Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and 
                applicable United States trade laws to redress China's 
                trade practices, including exchange rate manipulation, 
                denial of trading and distribution rights, insufficient 
                intellectual property rights protection, objectionable 
                labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced 
                technology transfers as a condition of doing business. 
                The United States Trade Representative should consult 
                with our trading partners regarding any trade dispute 
                with China.
                    (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic 
                efforts to identify and pursue initiatives to 
                revitalize United States engagement in East Asia. The 
                initiatives should have a regional focus and complement 
                bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic 
                Cooperation forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for 
                pursuit of such initiatives.
                    (D) Actions by the administration to work with 
                China to prevent proliferation of prohibited 
                technologies and to secure China's agreement to renew 
                efforts to curtail North Korea's commercial export of 
                ballistic missiles.
                    (E) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy 
                to consult with the International Energy Agency with 
                the objective of upgrading the current loose 
                experience-sharing arrangement whereby China engages in 
                some limited exchanges with the organization, to a more 
                structured arrangement.
                    (F) Actions by the administration to develop a 
                coordinated, comprehensive national policy and strategy 
                designed to maintain United States scientific and 
                technological leadership and competitiveness, in light 
                of the rise of China and the challenges of 
                globalization.
                    (G) Actions to review laws and regulations 
                governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
                United States (CFIUS), including exploring whether the 
                definition of national security should include the 
                potential impact on national economic security as a 
                criterion to be reviewed, and whether the chairmanship 
                of CFIUS should be transferred from the Secretary of 
                the Treasury to a more appropriate executive branch 
                agency.
                    (H) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of 
                State and Defense to press strongly their European 
                Union counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on 
                China.
                    (I) Actions by the administration to discourage 
                foreign defense contractors from selling sensitive 
                military use technology or weapons systems to China. 
                The administration should provide a comprehensive 
                annual report to the appropriate committees of Congress 
                on the nature and scope of foreign military sales to 
                China, particularly sales by Russia and Israel.

SEC. 1211. UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``United States 
Policy on Iraq Act''.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that, in order 
to succeed in Iraq--
            (1) members of the United States Armed Forces who are 
        serving or have served in Iraq and their families deserve the 
        utmost respect and the heartfelt gratitude of the American 
        people for their unwavering devotion to duty, service to the 
        Nation, and selfless sacrifice under the most difficult 
        circumstances;
            (2) it is important to recognize that the Iraqi people have 
        made enormous sacrifices and that the overwhelming majority of 
        Iraqis want to live in peace and security;
            (3) calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant 
        transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security 
        forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign 
        Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the phased 
        redeployment of United States forces from Iraq;
            (4) United States military forces should not stay in Iraq 
        any longer than required and the people of Iraq should be so 
        advised;
            (5) the Administration should tell the leaders of all 
        groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the 
        compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and 
        sustainable political settlement that is essential for 
        defeating the insurgency in Iraq, within the schedule they set 
        for themselves; and
            (6) the Administration needs to explain to Congress and the 
        American people its strategy for the successful completion of 
        the mission in Iraq.
    (c) Reports to Congress on United States Policy and Military 
Operations in Iraq.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and every three months thereafter until all 
United States combat brigades have redeployed from Iraq, the President 
shall submit to Congress an unclassified report on United States policy 
and military operations in Iraq. Each report shall include to the 
extent practical, the following unclassified information:
            (1) The current military mission and the diplomatic, 
        political, economic, and military measures, if any, that are 
        being or have been undertaken to successfully complete or 
        support that mission, including:
                    (A) Efforts to convince Iraq's main communities to 
                make the compromises necessary for a broad-based and 
                sustainable political settlement.
                    (B) Engaging the international community and the 
                region in the effort to stabilize Iraq and to forge a 
                broad-based and sustainable political settlement.
                    (C) Strengthening the capacity of Iraq's government 
                ministries.
                    (D) Accelerating the delivery of basic services.
                    (E) Securing the delivery of pledged economic 
                assistance from the international community and 
                additional pledges of assistance.
                    (F) Training Iraqi security forces and transferring 
                security responsibilities to those forces and the 
                government of Iraq.
            (2) Whether the Iraqis have made the compromises necessary 
        to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement 
        that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq.
            (3) Any specific conditions included in the April 2005 
        Multi-National Forces-Iraq campaign action plan (referred to in 
        United States Government Accountability Office October 2005 
        report on Rebuilding Iraq: DOD Reports Should Link Economic, 
        Governance, and Security Indicators to Conditions for 
        Stabilizing Iraq), and any subsequent updates to that campaign 
        plan, that must be met in order to provide for the transition 
        of security responsibility to Iraqi security forces.
            (4) To the extent that these conditions are not covered 
        under paragraph (3), the following should also be addressed:
                    (A) The number of battalions of the Iraqi Armed 
                Forces that must be able to operate independently or to 
                take the lead in counterinsurgency operations and the 
                defense of Iraq's territory.
                    (B) The number of Iraqi special police units that 
                must be able to operate independently or to take the 
                lead in maintaining law and order and fighting the 
                insurgency.
                    (C) The number of regular police that must be 
                trained and equipped to maintain law and order.
                    (D) The ability of Iraq's Federal ministries and 
                provincial and local governments to independently 
                sustain, direct, and coordinate Iraq's security forces.
            (5) The criteria to be used to evaluate progress toward 
        meeting such conditions.
            (6) A schedule for meeting such conditions, an assessment 
        of the extent to which such conditions have been met, 
        information regarding variables that could alter that schedule, 
        and the reasons for any subsequent changes to that schedule.

SEC. 2886. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF BAKERS CREEK MEMORIAL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 1943 and 1944, the United States Armed Forces 
        operated a rest and relaxation facility in Mackay, Queensland, 
        Australia, for troops serving in the Pacific Theater during 
        World War II.
            (2) On June 14, 1943, a Boeing B-17C was transporting 6 
        crew members and 35 servicemen from Mackay to Port Moresby, New 
        Guinea, to return the servicemen to duty after 10 days of rest 
        and relaxation leave at an Army/Red Cross facility.
            (3) The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off at Bakers 
        Creek, Australia, killing all 6 crew members and 34 of the 35 
        servicemen being transported in what was at that point the 
        worst crash in American air transport history, and what remains 
        the worst air disaster in Australian history.
            (4) Due to wartime censorship rules related to the movement 
        of troops, the tragic crash and loss of life were not reported 
        to the Australian or United States public.
            (5) Many family members of those killed did not learn the 
        circumstances of the troops deaths until they were contacted by 
        the Bakers Creek Memorial Foundation beginning in 1992.
            (6) As of May 2005, the Bakers Creek Memorial Foundation 
        had contacted 36 of the 40 families that lost loved ones in the 
        tragic crash, and was continuing efforts to locate the 
        remaining four families to inform them of the true events of 
        the crash at Bakers Creek.
            (7) The Australian people marked the tragic crash at Bakers 
        Creek with a memorial established in 1992, but no similar 
        memorial has been established in the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Army may establish an appropriate marker, at a site to 
be chosen at the discretion of the Secretary, to commemorate the 40 
members of the United States Armed Forces who lost their lives in the 
air crash at Bakers Creek, Australia, on June 14, 1943.

SEC. 2894. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LIMITATION ON TRANSFER OF UNITS FROM 
              CLOSED AND REALIGNED MILITARY INSTALLATIONS PENDING 
              READINESS OF RECEIVING LOCATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility 
        Structure of the United States, also known as the Overseas 
        Basing Commission, transmitted a report to the President and 
        Congress on August 15, 2005, that discussed considerations for 
        the return to the United States of up to 70,000 service 
        personnel and 100,000 family members and civilian employees 
        from overseas garrisons.
            (2) The 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission 
        released a report on September 8, 2005, to the President that 
        assessed the closure and realignment decisions of the 
        Department of Defense, which would affect 26,830 military 
        personnel positions.
            (3) Both of these reports expressed concerns that massive 
        movements of units, service personnel, and families may disrupt 
        unit operational effectiveness and the quality of life for 
        family members if not carried out with adequate planning and 
        resources.
            (4) The 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, in 
        its decision to close Fort Monmouth, included a provision 
        requiring the Secretary of Defense to provide a report that 
        ``movement of organizations, functions, or activities from Fort 
        Monmouth to Aberdeen Proving Ground will be accomplished 
        without disruption of their support to the Global War on 
        Terrorism or other critical contingency operations, and that 
        safeguards exist to ensure that necessary redundant 
        capabilities are put in place to mitigate potential degradation 
        of such support, and to ensure maximum retention of critical 
        workforce''.
            (5) The Overseas Basing Commission found that ``base 
        closings at home along with the return of yet additional masses 
        of service members and dependents from overseas will have major 
        impact on local communities and the quality of life that can be 
        expected. Movements abroad from established bases into new 
        locations, or into locations already in use that will be put 
        under pressure by increases in populations, will impact on 
        living conditions.''
            (6) The Overseas Basing Commission notes that the four most 
        critical elements of quality of life as they relate to 
        restructuring of the global defense posture are housing, 
        military child education, healthcare, and service member and 
        family services.
            (7) The Overseas Basing Commission recommended that 
        ``planners must take a `last day-first day' approach to the 
        movement of units and families from one location to another'', 
        meaning that they must maintain the support infrastructure for 
        personnel until the last day they are in place and must have 
        the support infrastructure in place on the first day troops 
        arrive in the new location.
            (8) The Overseas Basing Commission further recommended that 
        it is ``imperative that the `last day-first day' approach 
        should be taken whether the movement is abroad from one locale 
        to another, from overseas to the United States, or from one 
        base in CONUS [the continental United States] to yet another as 
        a result of base realignment and closures''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should not transfer any unit from a military 
installation closed or realigned due to the relocation of forces under 
the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy or the 2005 round of 
defense base closure and realignment until adequate facilities and 
infrastructure necessary to support the unit's mission and quality of 
life requirements for military families are ready for use at the 
receiving location.
