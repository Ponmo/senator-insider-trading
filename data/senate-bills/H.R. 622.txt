                    (B) such a period would then be in effect for such

        be repaid, or any part thereof, by deductions from any

        individual under this title or from any unemployment 
        compensation payable to such individual under any Federal 
        unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency 
        or under any other Federal law administered by the State agency 
        which provides for the payment of any assistance or allowance 
        with respect to any week of unemployment, during the 3-year 
        period after the date such individuals received the payment of 
        the temporary extended unemployment compensation to which they 
        were not entitled, except that no single deduction may exceed 
        50 percent of the weekly benefit amount from which such 
        deduction is made.
            (2) Opportunity for hearing.--No repayment shall be 
        required, and no deduction shall be made, until a determination 
        has been made, notice thereof and an opportunity for a fair 
        hearing has been given to the individual, and the determination 
        has become final.
    (d) Review.--Any determination by a State agency under this section 
shall be subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as 
determinations under the State unemployment compensation law, and only 
in that manner and to that extent.

and initial operation of such a pool.
    ``(b) Matching Funds for Operation of Pools.--
            ``(1) In general.--In the case of a State that has 
        established a qualified high risk pool that restricts premiums 
        charged under the pool to no more than 150 percent of the 
        premium for applicable standard risk rates and that offers a 
        choice of two or more coverage options through the pool, from 
        the funds appropriated under subsection (c)(2) and allotted to 
        the State under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall provide a 
        grant of up to 50 percent of the losses incurred by the State 
        in connection with the operation of the pool.

entitlement to a grant under this section.

this section, the term `qualified high risk pool' has the meaning given 
such term in section 2744(c)(2) and the term `State' means any of the 
50 States and the District of Columbia.''.

        construed as affecting the ability of a State to use 
        mechanisms, described in sections 2741(c) and 2744 of the 
        Public Health Service Act, as an alternative to applying the 
        guaranteed availability provisions of section 2741(a) of such 
        Act.
    (c) Information Reporting.--
            (1) In general.--Subpart B of part III of subchapter A of
