 the United States to annually submit a balanced budget, provided that the
 amendment proposed in such joint resolution shall be drafted or amended so
 as not to exacerbate any economic recession.
SEC. 15. PROGRAM BUDGET EVALUATION.
 It is the sense of the Senate that prior to the commencement of the One
 Hundred Fourth Congress, each authorizing committee of the Senate should
 conduct a comprehensive reexamination and evaluation of existing programs
 under its jurisdiction which result in the expenditure of Federal dollars,
 and report its findings to the Senate. Such committee reports should consider
 the following matters--
 (1) an identification of the objectives intended for the program and the
 problem it was intended to address;
 (2) an identification of any trends, developments, and emerging conditions
 which are likely to affect the future nature and extent of the problems or
 needs which the program is intended to address;
 (3) an identification of any other program having potentially conflicting
 or duplicative objectives;
 (4) a statement of the number and types of beneficiaries or persons served
 by the program;
 (5) an assessment of the effectiveness of the program and the degrees to
 which the original objectives of the program or group of programs have

SEC. 16. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY.

 and quality of life in the coming decades; and
 (2) increased productivity is the key to meeting the challenge and regaining
 the competitive edge the United States economy enjoyed in the past.
 (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE- It is the sense of the Senate that funds should
 be allocated to allow this Nation to commit to an increase in productivity
 and international competitiveness through a program of long-term strategic
 investment in--
 (1) the development of its human resources;
 (2) the physical infrastructure that supports economic activity;
 (3) the development and commercialization of technology; and
 (4) productive plants and equipment.
SEC. 17. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON WIC.
 (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
 (1) the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children
 (WIC) has been invaluable to millions of needy pregnant and nursing women,
 infants and children at nutritional risk for nearly 20 years;
 (2) President Bush has commendably recommended an increase in the WIC program
 for fiscal year 1993, continuing the strong bipartisan support for expanding
 the program to serve more of those eligible;
 (3) the chairmen of five major American corporations testified last year
 on WIC, declaring that an increased investment in WIC is essential to
 the Nation's future economic growth and that `WIC can make an important
 contribution to ensuring that . . . we have the productive workforce we need';
 (4) the CEO's called WIC `the health-care equivalent of a triple-A rated
 investment . . . one of the most reliable ways that Government can invest
 in its resources', and recommended that to achieve the national education
 goal established by the President and Governors that by the year 2000 all
 children should start school ready to learn, `. . . we need to set a related
 goal: Every woman, infant, and child who is eligible for WIC in 1995 and
 later years will be served by the program';
 (5) less than 60 percent of the eligible women, infants, and children are
 served by the program due to funding limitations;
 (6) a funding level of $3,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1993 is needed to
 remain on the 5-year path embarked upon by the Congress last year to reach
 full funding consistent with the CEO's recommendation; and
 (7) a recent United States Department of Agriculture study has demonstrated
 that the prenatal component of WIC reduces Medicaid costs by between
 $1.92 and $4.21 for each dollar invested in it, and studies issued by the
 National Bureau of Economic Research have found WIC to be one of the most
 cost-effective means of reducing infant mortality and indicate WIC also
 may produce long-term savings in special education costs.
 (b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that the WIC
 program should be funded at $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1993.
SEC. 18. DEFENSE INDUSTRY CONVERSION.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that--
 (1) the Office of Technology Assessment estimates that, during the period
 beginning in 1991 and ending in 1995, between 530,000 and 620,000 employees
 of private, defense-related industries in the United States will become
 unemployed as a result of reductions in such spending;
 (2) the retraining and reemployment of such members, civilian employees,
 and employees of private industry is critical to the capability of the
 private aerospace and defense industries of the United States to develop,
 commercialize, and market nondefense products and technologies; and
 (3) the capability of such industries to develop, commercialize, and market
 nondefense products and technologies will play a critical role in ensuring
 the long-term economic prosperity of such industries and the United States.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that--
 (1) no less than $1,000,000,000 in budget authority provided in this
 resolution for the defense function 050 for fiscal year 1993 should be made
 available for defense industry conversion-related activities such as those
 within the following programs:
 (A) DEFENSE INDUSTRY WORKERS- Job Training Partnership Act, Economic
 Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance;

 (i) Economic Development Administration;

 (C) TECHNOLOGY-
 (i) National Science Foundation education grants to engineers;
 (ii) Department of Energy technology transfer;
 (iii) National Institute of Standards and Technology; and
 (iv) Intelligent vehicle highway system; and
 (2) a meaningful percentage of the savings in Federal defense spending in
 fiscal years 1993 through 1997 should be made available for the establishment
 of programs to retrain and reemploy active duty members of the Armed Forces,
 civilian employees of the Department of Defense, and employees of private,
 defense-related industries who are involuntarily separated from such duty
 or become unemployed as a result of reductions in Federal spending for
 national defense.
SEC. 19. BUDGET AUTHORITY-OUTLAY RATIO.
 It is the sense of the Congress that if in decisions among priorities,
 the Committees on Appropriations find that an excess of budget authority
 would remain after dividing all of the outlays that this resolution
 allocates to those committees for fiscal year 1993, then to the extent that
 those committees wish to utilize that excess of budget authority, those
 committees should favor programs that cause outlays to occur more slowly,
 rather than employing delays of obligations or payment shifts that would
 increase outlays in fiscal year 1994.

Clerk of the House of Representatives.
