                projects under contract to the contractors are delayed 
                by delays caused by utility companies in utility 
                relocations; and
                    (ii) methods used by States in making any such 
                compensation.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the

                redistribute, to 1 or more other States, at the 
                Secretary's discretion, \1/3\ of the amount by which 
                the estimated cost of the State's applications is less

    CHAPTER 2--TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION

SEC. 1311. SHORT TITLE.

    This chapter may be cited as the ``Transportation Infrastructure 
Finance and Innovation Act of 1998''.

SEC. 1312. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) a well-developed system of transportation 
        infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, health, 
        and welfare of the people of the United States;
            (2) traditional public funding techniques such as grant 
        programs are unable to keep pace with the infrastructure 
        investment needs of the United States because of budgetary 
        constraints at the Federal, State, and local levels of 
        government;
            (3) major transportation infrastructure facilities that 
        address critical national needs, such as intermodal facilities, 
        border crossings, and multistate trade corridors, are of a 
        scale that exceeds the capacity of Federal and State assistance 
        programs in effect on the date of enactment of this Act;
            (4) new investment capital can be attracted to 
        infrastructure projects that are capable of generating their 
        own revenue streams through user charges or other dedicated 
        funding sources; and
            (5) a Federal credit program for projects of national 
        significance can complement existing funding resources by 
        filling market gaps, thereby leveraging substantial private co-
        investment.

SEC. 1313. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.

SEC. 1503. WETLAND RESTORATION PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) surface transportation has unintended but negative 
        consequences for wetlands and other water resources;
            (2) in almost every State, construction and other highway 
        activities have reduced or eliminated wetland functions and 
        values, such as wildlife habitat, ground water recharge, flood 
        control, and water quality benefits;
            (3) the United States has lost more than \1/2\ of the 
        estimated 220,000,000 acres of wetlands that existed during 
        colonial times; and
            (4) while the rate of human-induced destruction and 
        conversion of wetlands has slowed in recent years, the United 
        States has suffered unacceptable wetland losses as a result of 
        highway projects.
    (b) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a national 
wetland restoration pilot program (referred to in this section as the 
``program'') to fund mitigation projects to offset the degradation of 
wetlands, or the loss of functions and values of the aquatic resource, 
resulting from projects carried out before December 27, 1977, under 
title 23, United States Code (or similar projects as determined by the 
Secretary), for which mitigation has not been performed.
    (c) Applications.--To be eligible for funding under the program, a 
State shall submit an application to the Secretary that includes--
            (1) a description of the wetland proposed to be restored by 
        a mitigation project described in subsection (b) (referred to 
        in this section as a ``wetland restoration project'') under the 
        program (including the size and quality of the wetland);
            (2) such information as is necessary to establish a nexus 
        between--
                    (A) a project carried out under title 23, United 
                States Code (or a similar project as determined by the 
                Secretary); and
                    (B) the wetland values and functions proposed to be 
                restored by the wetland restoration project;
            (3) a description of the benefits expected from the 
        proposed wetland restoration project (including improvement of 
        water quality, improvement of wildlife habitat, ground water 
        recharge, and flood control);
            (4) a description of the State's level of commitment to the 
        proposed wetland restoration project (including the monetary 
        commitment of the State and any development of a State or 
        regional conservation plan that includes the proposed wetland 
        restoration); and
            (5) the estimated total cost of the wetland restoration 
        project.
    (d) Selection of Wetland Restoration Projects.--
            (1) Interagency council.--In consultation with the 
        Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the 
        Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary shall establish 
        an interagency advisory council to--
                    (A) review the submitted applications that meet the 
                requirements of subsection (c); and
                    (B) not later than 60 days after the application 
                deadline, select wetland restoration projects for 
                funding under the program.
            (2) Selection criteria for priority wetland restoration 
        projects.--In consultation with the Secretary of the Army, the 
        Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and 
        the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
        Secretary shall give priority in funding under this section to 
        wetland restoration projects that--
                    (A) provide for long-term monitoring and 
                maintenance of wetland resources;
                    (B) are managed by an entity, such as a State 
                wildlife agency, wetland conservation group, land 
                trust, or nature conservancy, with expertise in the 
                long-term monitoring and protection of wetland 
                resources; and

        management, operation, and development of surface 
        transportation systems that will serve the mobility needs of 
        people and freight within and through urbanized areas, while 
        minimizing transportation-related fuel consumption and air 
        pollution.
            ``(2) Development of plans and programs.--To accomplish the

                improvements supported with Federal surface 
                transportation funds or requiring Federal approvals, 
                with the objective of reducing the number of documents 
                required and better integrating required analyses and 
                findings wherever possible.

                        23, Code of Federal Regulations, as a stand-
                        alone requirement independent of other 
                        transportation planning requirements, and

                        investment study procedure which are not 
                        duplicated elsewhere with other transportation 
                        planning requirements, provided that in 
                        integrating such requirements, the Secretary 
                        shall not apply such requirements to any 
                        project which previously would not have been 
                        subject to section 450.318 of title 23, Code of 
                        Federal Regulations;
                            (ii) eliminate stand-alone report 
                        requirements wherever possible;
                            (iii) prevent duplication by drawing on the 
                        products of the planning process in the 
                        completion of all environmental and other 
                        project development analyses;
                            (iv) reduce project development time by 
                        achieving to the maximum extent practicable a 
                        single public interest decision process for 
                        Federal environmental analyses and clearances; 
                        and
                            (v) expedite and support all phases of 
                        decisionmaking by encouraging and facilitating 
                        the early involvement of metropolitan planning 
                        organizations, State departments of 
                        transportation, transit operators, and Federal 
                        and State environmental resource and permit 
                        agencies throughout the decisionmaking process.
            (3) Savings clause.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        affect the responsibility of the Secretary to conform review 
        requirements for transit projects under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to comparable requirements 
        under such Act applicable to highway projects.

        vehicles, including certain double-trailer and triple-trailer 
        trucks;
            (2) reports on the results of recent studies conducted by 
        the Federal Government describe, with respect to longer 
        combination vehicles--
                    (A) problems with the adequacy of rearward

follows:
``Sec. 5101. Findings and purposes
    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds with respect to hazardous materials 
transportation that--
            ``(1) approximately 4,000,000,000 tons of regulated 
        hazardous materials are transported each year and that 
        approximately 1,000,000 movements of hazardous materials occur 
        each day, according to Department of Transportation estimates;
            ``(2) accidents involving the release of hazardous 
        materials are a serious threat to public health and safety;
            ``(3) many States and localities have enacted laws and 
        regulations that vary from Federal laws and regulations 
        pertaining to the transportation of hazardous materials, 
        thereby creating the potential for unreasonable hazards in 
        other jurisdictions and confounding shippers and carriers that 
        attempt to comply with multiple and conflicting registration, 
        permitting, routings, notification, loading, unloading, 
        incidental storage, and other regulatory requirements;
            ``(4) because of the potential risks to life, property and 
        the environment posed by unintentional releases of hazardous 
        materials, consistency in laws and regulations governing the 
        transportation of hazardous materials, including loading, 
        unloading, and incidental storage, is necessary and desirable;
            ``(5) in order to achieve greater uniformity and to promote 
        the public health, welfare, and safety at all levels, Federal 
        standards for regulating the transportation of hazardous 
        materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce are 
        necessary and desirable;
            ``(6) in order to provide reasonable, adequate, and cost-
        effective protection from the risks posed by the transportation 
        of hazardous materials, a network of adequately trained State 
        and local emergency response personnel is required;
            ``(7) the movement of hazardous materials in commerce is 
        necessary and desirable to maintain economic vitality and meet 
        consumer demands, and shall be conducted in a safe and 
        efficient manner;
            ``(8) primary authority for the regulation of such 
        transportation should be consolidated in the Department of 
        Transportation to ensure the safe and efficient movement of 
        hazardous materials in commerce; and
            ``(9) emergency response personnel have a continuing need 
        for training on responses to releases of hazardous materials in 
        transportation and small businesses have a continuing need for 
        training on compliance with hazardous materials regulations.
    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this chapter are--

        hazardous materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign 
        commerce, including the loading, unloading, and incidental 
        storage of hazardous material;
            ``(2) to provide the Secretary with preemption authority to 
        achieve uniform regulation of hazardous material 
        transportation, to eliminate inconsistent rules that apply 
        differently from Federal rules, to ensure efficient movement of 
        hazardous materials in commerce, and to promote the national 
        health, welfare, and safety; and
            ``(3) to provide adequate training for public sector 
        emergency response teams to ensure safe responses to hazardous 
        material transportation accidents and incidents.''.

            Subtitle C--Comprehensive One-Call Notification

SEC. 3301. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) unintentional damage to underground facilities during 
        excavation is a significant cause of disruptions in 
        telecommunications, water supply, electric power, and other 
        vital public services, such as hospital and air traffic control 
        operations, and is a leading cause of natural gas and hazardous 
        liquid pipeline accidents;
            (2) excavation that is performed without prior notification 
        to an underground facility operator or with inaccurate marking 
        of such a facility prior to excavation can cause damage that 
        results in fatalities, serious injuries, harm to the 
        environment and disruption of vital services to the public; and
            (3) protection of the public and the environment from the 
        consequences of underground facility damage caused by 
        excavations will be enhanced by a coordinated national effort 
        to improve one-call notification programs in each State and the 
        effectiveness and efficiency of one-call notification systems 
        that operate under such programs.

        for rapid response to situations where the need to excavate is 
        urgent;
            ``(8) the extent to which accidents occur due to errors in 
        marking of underground facilities, untimely marking or errors 
        in the excavation process after a one-call notification system 
        has been notified of an excavation;
            ``(9) the extent to which personnel engaged in marking 
        underground facilities may be endangered;

        procedures by which waivers, exemptions, and pilot programs 
        under this section may be initiated. The regulation shall 
        provide--

SEC. 4101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) The Congress finds that--
            (1) there is a lack of air quality monitoring data for fine 
        particle levels, measured as PM<INF>2.5</INF>, in the United 
        States and the States should receive full funding for the 
        monitoring efforts;
            (2) such data would provide a basis for designating areas 
        as attainment or nonattainment for any PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
        national ambient air quality standards pursuant to the 
        standards promulgated in July 1997;
            (3) the President of the United States directed the 
        Administrator in a memorandum dated July 16, 1997, to complete 
        the next periodic review of the particulate matter national 
        ambient air quality standards by July 2002 in order to 
        determine ``whether to revise or maintain the standards'';
            (4) the Administrator has stated that 3 years of air 
        quality monitoring data for fine particle levels, measured as 
        PM<INF>2.5</INF> and performed in accordance with any 
        applicable Federal reference methods, is appropriate for 
        designating areas as attainment or nonattainment pursuant to 
        the July 1997 promulgated standards; and
            (5) the Administrator has acknowledged that in drawing 
        boundaries for attainment and nonattainment areas for the July 
        1997 ozone national air quality standards, Governors would 
        benefit from considering implementation guidance from EPA on 
        drawing area boundaries.
    (b) The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to ensure that 3 years of air quality monitoring data 
        regarding fine particle levels are gathered for use in the 
        determination of area attainment or nonattainment designations 
        respecting any PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality 
        standards;
            (2) to ensure that the Governors have adequate time to 
        consider implementation guidance from EPA on drawing area 
        boundaries prior to submitting area designations respecting the 
        July 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards;
            (3) to ensure that implementation of the July 1997 
        revisions of the ambient air quality standards are consistent 
        with the purposes of the President's Implementation Memorandum 
        dated July 16, 1997.

SEC. 4102. PARTICULATE MATTER MONITORING PROGRAM.

    (a) Through grants under section 103 of the Clean Air Act the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall use 
appropriated funds no later than fiscal year 2000 to fund 100 percent 
of the cost of the establishment, purchase, operation and maintenance 
of a PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring network necessary to implement the 
national ambient air quality standards for PM<INF>2.5</INF> under 
section 109 of the Clean Air Act. This implementation shall not result 
in a diversion or reprogramming of funds from other Federal, State or 
local Clean Air Act activities. Any funds previously diverted or 
reprogrammed from section 105 Clean Air Act grants for PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitors must be restored to State or local air programs in fiscal year 
1999.
    (b) EPA and the States shall ensure that the national network 
(designated in subsection (a)) which consists of the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitors necessary to implement the national ambient air quality 
standards is established by December 31, 1999.
    (c) The Governors shall be required to submit designations for each 
area following promulgation of the July 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> national 
ambient air quality standard within 1 year after receipt of 3 years of 
air quality monitoring data performed in accordance with any applicable 
Federal reference methods for the relevant areas. Only data from the 
monitoring network designated in subsection (a) and other Federal 
reference method PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitors shall be considered for such 
designations. In reviewing the State Implementation Plans the 
Administrator shall consider all relevant monitoring data regarding 
transport of PM<INF>2.5</INF>.
    (d) The Administrator shall promulgate designations of 
nonattainment areas no later than 1 year after the initial designations 
required under subsection (c) are required to be submitted. 
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrator shall 
promulgate such designations not later than December 31, 2005.
    (e) The Administrator shall conduct a field study of the ability of 
the PM<INF>2.5</INF> Federal Reference Method to differentiate those 
particles that are larger than 2.5 micrograms in diameter. This study 
shall be completed and provided to Congress no later than 2 years from 
the date of enactment of this legislation.

SEC. 4103. OZONE DESIGNATION REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) The Governors shall be required to submit designations of 
nonattainment areas within 2 years following the promulgation of the 
July 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards.
    (b) The Administrator shall promulgate final designations no later 
than 1 year after the designations required under subsection (a) are 
required to be submitted.

SEC. 4104. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS.

    Nothing in sections 4101-4103 shall be construed by the 
Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency or any court, State, 
or person to affect any pending litigation or to be a ratification of 
the ozone or PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards.

SEC. 5014. JOB ACCESS AND REVERSE COMMUTE GRANTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) two-thirds of all new jobs are in the suburbs, whereas 
        three-quarters of welfare recipients live in rural areas or 
        central cities;
            (2) even in metropolitan areas with excellent public 
        transit systems, less than half of the jobs are accessible by 
        transit;
            (3) in 1991, the median price of a new car was equivalent 
        to 25 weeks of salary for the average worker, and considerably 
        more for the low-income worker;
            (4) not fewer than 9,000,000 households and 10,000,000 
        Americans of driving age, most of whom are low-income workers, 
        do not own cars;
            (5) 94 percent of welfare recipients do not own cars;
            (6) nearly 40 percent of workers with annual incomes below 
        $10,000 do not commute by car;
            (7) many of the 2,000,000 Americans who will have their 
        Temporary Assistance to Needy Families grants (under the State 
        program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)) terminated by the year 2002 will 
        be unable to get to jobs they could otherwise hold;
            (8) increasing the transit options for low-income workers, 
        especially those who are receiving or who have recently 
        received welfare benefits, will increase the likelihood of 
        those workers getting and keeping jobs; and
            (9) many residents of cities and rural areas would like to 
        take advantage of mass transit to gain access to suburban 
        employment opportunities.

    (a) Study.--The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct a study 
to determine whether the formula for apportioning funds to urbanized 
areas under section 5336 of title 49, United States Code accurately

mechanism to reflect the fact that some urbanized areas with a 
population between 50,000 and 200,000 have transit systems that carry 
more passengers per mile or hour than the average of those transit 
systems in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000.
