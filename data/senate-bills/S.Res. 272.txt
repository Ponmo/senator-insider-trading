                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the success of the Varela 
  Project's collection of 10,000 certified signatures in support of a 
 national referendum and the delivery of these signatures to the Cuban 
                           National Assembly.

Whereas Article 88 of the Cuban Constitution provides for Cuban citizens to 
        submit legislative proposals to the Cuban National Assembly for its 
        consideration;
Whereas on May 10, 2002, a group of Cuban citizens led by Oswaldo Paya delivered 
        11,020 verified signatures to the Cuban National Assembly in support of 
        a referendum;
Whereas Mr. Paya's petition drive is inspired by the 19th-century priest and 
        Cuban independence hero, Padre Felix Varela, and is known as the Varela 
        Project;
Whereas the Varela Project seeks a referendum on civil liberties, including 
        freedom of speech, amnesty for political prisoners, support for private 
        business, a new electoral law, and a general election;
Whereas the Varela Project is supported by 140 opposition organizations in Cuba 
        and has received no money or support from foreign citizens or foreign 
        governments;
Whereas the Varela Project is the largest petition drive in Cuban history;
Whereas the Varela Project is a step in moving Cuba toward achieving 
        international standards for human rights;
Whereas the goal of United States policy in Cuba is to promote a peaceful 
        transition to democracy; and
Whereas the Varela Project is engaged in the promotion of a peaceful transition 
        to democracy in Cuba: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the constitutional right of the citizens of 
        Cuba who have signed the Varela Project to petition the Cuban 
        National Assembly for a referendum;
            (2) calls on the Cuban National Assembly to give serious 
        consideration to the Varela Project petition in accordance with 
        Article 88 of the Cuban Constitution and to the holding of a 
        referendum on civil liberties, including freedom of speech, an 
        amnesty for political prisoners, support for private business, 
        a new electoral law, and a general election;
            (3) praises the bravery of Oswaldo Paya and his colleagues 
        in collecting 11,020 verified signatures in support of the 
        Varela Project;
            (4) calls on the Cuban government to provide its citizens 
        with internationally accepted standards for civil and human 
        rights, and the opportunity to vote in free and fair elections; 
        and
            (5) urges the President to support the right of the 
        citizens of Cuba who have signed the Varela Project to petition 
        the Cuban National Assembly for a referendum and the peaceful 
        transition to democracy.
    Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this 
resolution to the President.
