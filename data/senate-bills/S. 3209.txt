  (3) the farm program payment yield for the crop for the farm.
  (b) PAYMENT ACRES- For purposes of subsection (a)(2), payment acres for
  a crop shall be--
  (1) the number of acres planted to the crop for harvest within the number
  of acres obtained by multiplying--
  (A) the crop acreage base for the crop for the farm; by
  (B) one minus the base reduction percentage (as determined under subsection
  (c)); less
  (2) the quantity of reduced acreage (as determined under subsection (d)(1)).

  brought by the Corporation shall have priority over any suit, claim, or
  cause of action asserted against that person by a depositor, creditor,
  or shareholder of the insured depository institution other than a suit,
  claim, or cause of action asserted by a Federal agency (other than the

  a suit, claim, or cause of action asserted by a depositor, creditor, or
  shareholder of an insured depository institution in a proceeding described
  in paragraph (1), a suit, claim, or cause of action of the Corporation
  shall not have priority under paragraph (1) unless--
  `(i) not later than 180 days after the date on which the Corporation receives
  the notice, or if the Corporation acquires its claim after receipt of the
  notice, not later than 180 days after the date on which the Corporation
  acquires its claim, the Corporation files with the court a statement that
  the Corporation intends to pursue potential claims against the insured
  depository institution's director, officer, employee, agent, attorney,

  the Corporation to commence its proceeding unless the court finds that the
  prejudice that would result to a person's ability to prove the person's
  claim that would result from a grant of the requested enlargement of time
  would outweigh the harm to the Government that would result from a denial
  of the requested enlargement of time.
  `(ii) In making a finding under clause (i), the court shall consider the
  diligence with which the Corporation is investigating its claim.

  any suit, claim, or cause of action, and to the execution of any subsequent
  judgment resulting from such suit, claim, or cause of action.

  and (e)(2); and

  account high loan-to-value ratios. Such determination shall be in accordance
  with the findings of the annual actuarial study of the Mutual Mortgage
  Insurance Fund required under section 205(e). The additional premium charge
  may not exceed an amount   equivalent to one-half of 1 percent per year
  of the amount  of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at
  any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments,
  and may be required (A) for up to 15 years if the initial loan-to-value
  ratio of the mortgage is greater than 95 percent, (B) for up to 10 years
  if the initial loan-to-value ratio is equal to or less than 95 percent
  but equal to or greater than 93 percent, and (C) for up to 4 years if the
  initial loan-to-value ratio is less than 93 percent but greater than or
  equal to 90 percent. The Secretary may establish a periodic premium rate
  higher than that referred to in the preceding sentence if necessary to
  achieve actuarial soundness. The Secretary shall not require payment of
  an additional premium charge where the initial loan-to-value ratio of
  the mortgage is less than 90 percent. For purposes of this paragraph,
  the premium charges shall not be included in the determination of the
  initial loan-to-value ratio  of the mortgage.'.

  by adding after subparagraph (B) the following:
  `(C)(i) In lieu of accepting assignment of the original credit instrument
  and the mortgage securing the same under subparagraph (A) in exchange
  for receipt of debentures, the Secretary shall arrange for the sale of
  the beneficial interests in the mortgage loan through an auction and sale
  of the (I) mortgage loans, or (II) participation certificates, or other
  mortgage-backed obligations in a form acceptable to the Secretary (herein
  referred to as `participating certificates', unless the mortgagee can
  demonstrate that the auction and sale is less economically advantageous
  to it than the receipt of debentures. The Secretary shall arrange the
  auction and sale at a price, to be paid to the mortgagee, of par plus
  accrued interest to the date of sale. The sale price would also include
  the right to a subsidy payment described in subsection (c).
  `(ii)(I) The Secretary shall conduct a public auction to determine the
  lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the beneficial
  interests in the original credit instrument and mortgage securing such a
  credit instrument.
  `(II) A mortgagee who elects to assign his mortgage must provide
  the Secretary and persons bidding at the auction a description of the
  characteristics of the original credit instrument and mortgage securing
  the original credit instrument to include, but not be limited to: principal
  mortgage balance; original stated interest rate; service fees; real estate
  and tenant characteristics; the level and duration of applicable Federal
  subsidies; and any other information determined by the Secretary to be
  appropriate. The Secretary shall also provide the status of this property
  with respect to provisions in the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation
  Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act with respect to eligibility to prepay
  mortgage, whether the owner has filed an Intent to Prepay or a Plan of
  Action under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987
  or under any subsequent Act; and the details with respect to incentives
  provided in the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or
  under any subsequent Act in lieu of exercising prepayment rights.
  `(III) The Secretary shall, upon receipt of the information in subclause
  (II), promptly advertise for an auction and publish such mortgage
  descriptions in advance of the auction. For administrative simplicity,
  the Secretary may wait up to 6 months to conduct the auction, but under no
  circumstances may the Secretary conduct an auction before 2 months after
  receiving the mortgagee's written notice of intent to assign its mortgage
  to the Secretary.
  `(IV) The lowest interest rate bid for such purchase by a bidder determined
  by the Secretary to be acceptable shall be accepted by the Secretary and
  published in the Federal Register. Settlement for the sale of the credit
  instrument and the mortgage underlying the credit instrument shall occur
  within 30 business days of the date winning bidders are selected in the
  auction.
  `(V) If no bids are received or if the bids that are received are not
  acceptable to the Secretary, the mortgage shall retain all rights under
  this section to assign the mortgage loan to the Secretary.
  `(iii) As part of the auction process, the Secretary shall agree to provide
  a monthly interest subsidy payment from the General Insurance Fund to the
  holder of the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing such a
  credit instrument (and its assigns who are approved mortgagees). The subsidy
  payment shall be paid on the first day of each month in an amount equal to
  the difference between the stated interest due on the mortgage loan and the
  lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the Participation
  Certificates for the then unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest
  on the mortgage loan. Each interest subsidy payment shall be treated by
  the holder of the mortgage as interest paid on the mortgage. Such interest
  subsidy payment shall be provided until the earlier of--
  `(I) the maturity date of the loan;
  `(II) prepayment of the mortgage loan in accordance with the Emergency
  Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act, where
  applicable; or
  `(III) default and full payment of insurance benefits on the mortgage loan
  by the Federal Housing Administration.
  `(iv) The Secretary shall require that the loans presented for assignment
  be auctioned with servicing rights as whole loans and as participating
  certificates with servicing retained by the current servicer, except that
  the Secretary may determine if the inclusion of servicing rights in the sale
  will prove beneficial to the financial interests of the Federal Government.
  `(v) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall encourage State Housing
  Finance Agencies, nonprofit organizations, and organizations representing
  the tenants of the property for which the mortgage is being sold, or some
  other qualified mortgagee participating in a Plan of Action described in
  the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent
  Act to participate fully in the auction and subsidy mechanism, described
  in clauses (ii) and (iii).
  `(vi) The Secretary shall implement the requirements imposed by this
  subparagraph within 30 days from the date of enactment and not be subject to
  the requirement of prior issuance of regulations in the Federal Register. The
  Secretary shall issue regulations implementing this section within 6 months
  of enactment.
  `(vii) Nothing in this subparagraph shall diminish or impair the low income
  use restrictions applicable to the project under the original regulatory
  agreement or the revised agreement entered into pursuant to the Emergency
  Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent Act, if any,
  or other agreements for the provision of Federal assistance to the housing
  or its tenants.
  `(viii) The provisions of this subparagraph expire effective October 1,
  1995. Not later than January 31 of each year, the Secretary shall transmit
  to this Congress a report that includes: the number of mortgages auctioned
  and sold and their value, the amount of subsidies committed to this program,
  the number of mortgages transferred to preferred mortgagees, the ability of
  the Secretary to coordinate this program with the incentives provided under
  the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent
  Act, and the costs and benefits derived from this program for the Federal
  Government.'.

Subtitle B--Airport Capacity
PART 1--SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS
SEC. 3101. SHORT TITLE.
  This subtitle may be cited as the `Airport Capacity Act of 1990'.
SEC. 3102. FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase in
  airport capacity;
  (2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent
  restrictions on aviation which have impeded its ability to meet
  transportation needs, and are imposing undue burdens on interstate and
  foreign commerce;
  (3) a noise policy must be implemented at the national level;
  (4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in
  determining the national interest;
  (5) community concerns can be alleviated through the technology aircraft,
  combined with the use of revenues, including those available from passenger
  facility charges, for noise management;
  (6) federally controlled revenues can help resolve noise problems and
  carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;
  (7) a precondition to the establishment or collection of a passenger facility
  charge shall be the establishment by the Secretary of Transportation of
  a national noise policy;
  (8) revenues derived from a passenger facility charge may be applied to
  noise management and increased airport capacity;
  (9) provisions of subpart S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal
  Regulations (known as the `buy-sell rule'), which allow a public right to be
  used as a private asset, not only restrict competition at the four airports
  whose use is controlled through slots but also can impede competition in
  air transportation throughout the northeastern and midwestern United States;
  (10) passengers pay higher fares at slot controlled airports than at
  other airports;
  (11) increasing the number of slots at high density traffic airports will
  make it easier for carriers not already engaged in regular operations at
  those airports to achieve regular operations; and
  (12) improvements in the air traffic control system since the initiation
  of slot controls, including new technology and new methods of regulating
  air traffic, necessitate a complete review of the practice of using slots
  to control access to high density traffic airports.

  (a) The Secretary of Transportation shall, by regulation, not later than
  January 1, 1992, develop and articulate a National Aviation Noise Policy
  which takes into account the findings and determinations and provisions
  of this section.
  (b) The National Aviation Noise Policy shall include the establishment of a
  date or dates for the phasing out of stage 2 technology aircraft as part of
  a comprehensive national noise management scheme. Such consideration must
  include a detailed economic analysis of the impact of any phaseout date
  on competition in the airline industry, including the carriers' ability
  to achieve capacity growth consistent with the projected rate of growth
  for the industry; the impact of constrained capacity and aircraft prices
  on airfares and competition within the airline and air cargo industries;
  the impact on non-hub and smaller community air service and the impact of
  such a phaseout on new entry into the airline industry. No phaseout date
  shall be approved if it would result in an unreasonably adverse impact on
  any of these considerations.
SEC. 3202. NOISE AND ACCESS RESTRICTION REVIEWS.
  (a) The National Aviation Noise Policy shall require the establishment
  of a program for the mandatory review and approval of all existing or
  proposed local airport noise or access restrictions by the Federal Aviation
  Administration, except for restrictions which have been approved by the
  Federal Aviation Administration by regulation prior to enactment of this Act.
  (b) No airport noise or access restriction could be submitted for approval
  or approved in accordance with the program if it contains any restriction
  on the operation of a stage 3, quiet technology aircraft, including but
  not limited to--
  (1) any restriction as to noise levels generated on either a single event
  or cumulative basis;
  (2) any limit, direct or indirect, on the total number of stage 3 aircraft
  operations;
  (3) any noise budget or noise allocation program which would include stage
  3 aircraft;
  (4) any restriction imposing limits on hours of operations;
  (5) any other limit on stage 3 aircraft.
  (c) No airport noise or access restriction could include a restriction on
  other than stage 3 aircraft, unless the airport operator submitting the
  existing or proposed noise or access regulation to the Administrator for
  review and approval in accordance with this Act has submitted concurrently--
  (1) a complete analysis of the anticipated or actual costs and benefits
  of the existing or proposed noise regulation;
  (2) a detailed description of alternative regulations;
  (3) a detailed description of the alternative measures considered not
  involving aircraft restrictions, and a comparison of the costs and benefits
  of such alternative measures to the costs and benefits of the proposed
  noise or access regulation. The analysis of anticipated costs and benefits
  shall include an estimate of the potential economic and operational impact
  of the noise or access regulation on the national air transportation system.
  (d) After review of the information described in subparagraph (c) and any
  other information the Administrator deems necessary, the Administrator
  shall approve or disapprove such proposed noise regulation subject to the
  provision of subsection (e).
  (e) The Administrator shall not approve a noise or access regulation
  unless the Administrator finds the following conditions to be supported
  by substantial evidence--
  (1) the regulation is reasonable, nonarbitrary and nondiscriminatory;
  (2) the regulation does not create an undue burden on interstate or
  foreign commerce;
  (3) the regulation is not inconsistent with maintaining the safe and
  efficient utilization of the navigable airspace;
  (4) the regulation does not conflict with any existing Federal statute
  or regulation;
  (5) the airport operator provided an adequate opportunity for public
  comment with respect to the regulation;
  (6) the airport operator's rejection of alternative means of minimizing
  or otherwise managing noise was reasonable; and
  (7) the benefits accruing from the regulation outweigh the associated costs,
  including all costs attributable to the impact or potential impact of the
  regulation on the national air transportation system.
  (f) Sponsors of facilities operating under noise or access restrictions
  at the time of passage of this Act, except as specified in subsection (a),
  shall not be eligible to impose a Passenger Facility Charge, and shall not
  be eligible for grants authorized by section 505 of the Airport and Airway
  Improvement Act of 1982 (49 U.S.C. App. 2204) 90 days after the date on
  which the Secretary promulgates the final rule called for under section
  3201 of this Act, unless the Administrator has approved the restriction
  under section (e),  or the restriction has been rescinded.
  (g) The Administrator shall reevaluate any previously approved noise
  regulation upon the request of any aircraft or airport operator able to
  demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that there has been a
  change in the noise environment of the affected airport and that a review
  and reevaluation of the benefits and costs of the previously approved
  noise regulation is therefore justified.
  (h) The Administrator shall establish by regulation procedures under
  which the evaluation provided in subsection (g) of this section shall be
  accomplished. Such evaluation shall not occur less than 2 years after a
  determination under subsection (g) of this section has been made.
SEC. 3203. FEDERAL LIABILITY FOR NOISE DAMAGES.
  In the event of a disapproval of a proposed noise or access restriction,
  the Federal Government shall assume liability for noise damages only
  to the extent that a taking has occurred as a direct result of such
  disapproval. Action for the resolution of such a case shall be brought
  solely in the United States Claims Court.

  or collect a passenger facility charge, unless the Administrator--
  (1) has approved any noise or access restriction in place at that airport;
  and
  (2) assures that the airport is not imposing any noise or access restriction
  not submitted and approved in compliance with this part.
SEC. 3206. NOISE COMPATIBILITY PROGRAM.
  No proposal for the imposition of a passenger facility charge shall be
  approved by the Secretary if the airport has not conducted an airport
  noise compatibility program pursuant to section 104(b) of the Aviation
  Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979.

  `(e) EXCEPTION FOR IMPOSITION OF PASSENGER FACILITY CHARGES- (1)
  Notwithstanding the above limitations the Secretary of Transportation is
  hereby authorized to establish by regulation a program for the imposition
  of approved passenger facility charges by any airport proprietor to finance
  eligible projects.
  `(2) Passenger facility charges shall be imposed only as approved by the
  Secretary of Transportation and shall be approved only in full dollar
  amounts not to exceed three dollars per passenger. They shall remain in
  effect only during such periods as are necessary to pay for such specific
  projects as are identified to support their imposition.
  `(3) Passenger facility charges shall be collected only from revenue
  passengers originating or terminating their travel at the airport imposing
  such a charge.
  `(4) No proposal for the imposition of a passenger facility charge shall
  be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless:
  `(A) The airport proprietor seeking to impose the passenger facility
  charge certifies, in writing, that airport users and the general public
  have been provided with: a minimum of seventy-five days advance notice of
  the proposal; a full and detailed description of the project intended to
  be financed; a detailed financial plan for full funding of the specific
  project; and an opportunity to meet with the airport proprietor to present
  their views. On the basis of such advance notification and information
  the airport proprietor shall solicit the approval or disapproval of the
  airport users and the general public and shall advise the Secretary of
  Transportation of any disagreements with the proposed imposition of a
  passenger facility charge and the reasons supporting such disagreement.
  `(B) In the event that no disagreement is registered, the Secretary shall
  approve the passenger facility charge.
  `(C) In the event that disagreement is registered with reference to
  a project otherwise eligible for funding under the provisions of the
  Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, the Secretary shall approve
  such passenger facility charge unless the Secretary finds by substantial
  evidence that it would not significantly benefit airport security, safety,
  noise mitigation, or capacity.
  `(D) The Secretary shall establish, by appropriate rule, the procedures under
  which a disagreement is registered and an appeal heard under subsection (c).
  `(E) In the event that disagreement is registered with reference to
  a project to build airport gates, the Secretary shall not approve such
  passenger facility charge unless he finds by substantial evidence that the
  project is justified by the need to increase capacity at the facility or
  facilities affected. Under no circumstances shall any gates constructed,
  improved, or repaired with passenger facility charges under this paragraph be
  subject to long-term leases for periods exceeding 10 years, or to majority
  in interest clauses.
  `(F) No other projects other than those defined in this title may be
  financed by a passenger facility charge.
  `(5) Any proposal to amend a project supported by an approved passenger
  facility charge necessitating an upward adjustment of project financing
  costs shall be treated as a new proposal for the imposition of a passenger
  facility charge and submitted for approval.
  `(6) No passenger facility charge shall be approved for imposition prior to
  the adoption by regulation of a national aviation noise policy in accordance
  with the provisions of title III of this Act and, in no event, prior to
  such date at which the unobligated balance contained in the Airport and
  Airway Trust Fund is less than $4,000,000,000.
  `(7) Authority for the approval of any new passenger facility charge,
  or the modification of any existing charge, shall terminate in the event
  that appropriations fail to be made to fund at least ninety-five percent
  of each amount authorized for facilities and equipment, essential air
  service, the airport improvement program and the research engineering
  and development programs of the Federal Aviation Administration during
  any fiscal year. Further, all authority to approve any passenger facility
  charge shall terminate at any time funds are spent from this Act except
  as authorized by this Act.
  `(8)(A) Revenues derived from collection of a fee by an airport proprietor
  pursuant to this subsection shall not be treated as airport revenues
  for the purpose of establishing rates, fees and charges pursuant to any
  contract between such airport and an air carrier.
  `(B) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (C) hereof, such airport
  shall not include the portion of the capital costs of any project paid
  for from such passenger facility charge revenues in the rate base, by
  means of depreciation, amortization or otherwise, in establishing fees,
  rates and charges for air carriers.
  `(C) With respect to any project for terminal development, for gates and
  related areas, or for any facility which is occupied or utilized by one
  or more air carriers on an exclusive or preferential basis, the rates,
  fees and charges payable by air carriers which use such facilities shall
  be no less than the rates, fees and charges paid by carriers using similar
  facilities  at  the  airport  which  were  not  financed  with revenues
  derived from collection of a fee pursuant to this subsection.
  `(D) Except as provided in this subsection, nothing contained in this Act
  shall be construed as endorsing or authorizing the unilateral abrogation,
  abridgement or alteration of any existing contract or lease provision in

  section 401(h) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 App. U.S.C. 1371(h)).
  (E) Each new entrant slot shall be public property and its use shall
  represent a nonpermanent operating privilege within the exclusive control
  and jurisdiction of the Secretary and the Administrator. Any such privilege
  may be withdrawn, recalled, or reallocated by the Secretary for reasons
  of aviation safety, airspace efficiency, the enhancement of competition
  in air transportation, or any other matter in the public interest and in
  accordance with the public convenience and necessity.
  (F) If the holder of a new entrant slot, including a slot made available
  under subparagraph (C), fails to initiate use of the slot within 60 days
  after receiving the slot or thereafter fails to use the slot in accordance
  with rules for use of existing air carrier slots, the new entrant slot shall
  be withdrawn and, if appropriate, be reallocated to another new entrant
  carrier. In addition to such grounds for withdrawal, a new entrant slot made
  available under subparagraph (C) shall also be withdrawn and reallocated,
  in accordance with this paragraph, if the holder fails to use the slot in
  providing air service as described in subparagraph (C).

  total number of authorized daily operations at Washington National Airport
  as provided in subpart K of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.
  (3) Such special authorizations shall be allocated by lottery and in such
  a manner that, to the maximum extent practicable, all such air carriers
  have an equal number of slots and special authorizations overall at
  Washington National Airport. No such air carrier shall receive a special
  authorization under this subsection which gives that carrier more than 12
  slots and special authorizations overall at Washington National Airport.
  (4) If such special authorizations remain unused after such air carriers
  have had an opportunity to obtain them, the remaining authorizations may
  only be made available to air carriers that have fewer than 12 slots at
  Washington National Airport.
  (5) Each such special authorization shall be public property and its use
  shall represent a nonpermanent operating privilege within the exclusive
  control and jurisdiction of the Secretary and the Administrator. Any such
  privilege may be withdrawn, recalled, or reallocated by the Secretary
  for reasons of aviation safety, airspace efficiency, the enhancement
  of competition in air transportation, or any other matter in the public
  interest and in accordance with the public convenience and necessity.
  (5) If the holder of an air carrier special authorization fails to initiate
  use of the authorization within 60 days after receiving the authorization
  or thereafter fails to use the authorization in accordance with rules for

  other Federal employment until changed by the Corporation in accordance
  with the provisions of this title.
  `f. The provisions of sections 3323(a) and 8344 of title 5, United States
  Code, or any other law prohibiting or limiting the reemployment of retired
  officers or employees or the simultaneous receipt of compensation and
  retired pay or annuities, shall not apply to officers and employees of the
  Corporation who have retired from or ceased previous government service
  prior to April 28, 1987.

  not prejudice consideration of any site as a candidate site for future
  expansion or replacement of uranium enrichment capacity;
  `(2) at such time subsequent to the year 2000 as the Secretary determines
  that the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant should be decommissioned
  or decontaminated, or both, the Secretary shall convey without charge

  the necessary cooperation and support of the Department to assure the
  commercial development and deployment of AVLIS or other technologies in
  a manner consistent with the intent of this title.
  `c. The Secretary is authorized and directed to grant the Corporation
  without charge, to the extent necessary or appropriate for the conduct

  `b. (1) The Corporation shall issue capital stock representing an equity
  investment equal to the book value of assets transferred to the Corporation,
  as reported in the Uranium Enrichment Annual Report for fiscal year 1987,
  modified to reflect continued depreciation and other usual changes that
  occur up to date of transfer. The Secretary of the Treasury shall hold
  such stock for the United States: Provided, That all rights and duties
  pertaining to management of the Corporation shall remain vested in the
  Administrator as specified in section 1501.
  `(2) The capital stock of the Corporation shall not be sold, transferred,
  or conveyed by the United States unless such disposition is specifically
  authorized by Federal law enacted after enactment of this title.
  `c. The Corporation shall pay into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury
  of the United States or such other fund as provided by law, dividends
  on the capital stock, out of earnings of the Corporation, as a return on
  the investment represented by such stock. The Corporation shall pay such
  dividends out of earnings, unless there is an overriding need to retain
  these funds in furtherance of other corporate functions including but not
  limited to research and development, capital investments and establishment
  of cash reserves.
  `d. The Corporation shall repay within a twenty-year period the amount
  of $364,000,000 into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury of the United

  average yield on twenty-year Government obligations as determined by the
  Secretary of the Treasury on the date of enactment of this title. The money
  required to be repaid under this subsection is hereinafter referred to as
  the `Initial Debt'.
  `e. Receipt by the United States of the stock issued by the Corporation
  (including all rights appurtenant thereto) together with repayment of the
  Initial Debt and the fees established under section 1701.c shall constitute
  the sole recovery by the United States of previously unrecovered costs that
  have been incurred by the United States of uranium enrichment activities
  prior to enactment of this title.
  `SEC. 1507. Borrowing:
  `a. (1) The Corporation is authorized to issue and sell bonds, notes, and
  other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter collectively referred to as

  time to assist in financing its activities and to refund such bonds. The
  principal of and interest on said bonds shall be payable from revenues of
  the Corporation.
  `(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Corporation may
  pledge and use its revenues for payment of the principal of and interest
  on said bonds, for purchase or redemption thereof, and for other purposes
  incidental thereto, including creation of reserve funds and other funds
  which may be similarly pledged and used, to such extent and in such manner
  as it may deem necessary or desirable.
  `(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Corporation is
  authorized to enter into binding convenants with the holders of said
  bonds--and with the trustee, if any--under any indenture, resolution,
  or other agreement entered into in connection with the issuance thereof
  with respect to the establishment of reserve funds and other funds,
  stipulations concerning the subsequent issuance of bonds, and such other
  matters, not inconsistent with this title, as the Corporation may deem
  necessary or desirable to enhance the marketability of said bonds.
  `(4) Bonds issued by the Corporation hereunder shall not be obligations
  of, nor shall payments of the principal thereof or interest thereon be
  guaranteed by, the United States.
  `b. Bonds issued by the Corporation under this section shall be negotiable
  instruments unless otherwise specified therein, shall be in such forms and
  denominations, shall be sold at such times and in such amounts, shall mature
  at such time or times not more than thirty years from their respective
  dates, shall be sold at such prices, shall bear such rates of interest,
  may be redeemable before maturity at the option of the Corporation in
  such manner and at such times and redemption premiums, may be entitled
  to such priorities of claim on the Corporation's revenues with respect
  to principal and interest payments, and shall be subject to such other
  terms and conditions, as the Corporation may determine: Provided, That at
  least fifteen days before selling each issue of bonds hereunder (exclusive
  of any commitment shorter than one year) the Corporation shall advise
  the Secretary of the Treasury as to the amount, proposed date of sale,
  maturities, terms and conditions and expected rates of interest of the
  proposed issue in the fullest detail possible. The Corporation shall not
  be subject to the provisions of section 9108 of title 31, United States
  Code. The Corporation shall be deemed part of an executive department
  or an independent establishment of the United States for purposes of the
  provisions of section 78c(c) of title 15, United States Code.
  `c. Bonds issued by the Corporation hereunder shall be lawful investments
  and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds,
  the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority or control
  of any officer or agency of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury
  or any other officer or agency having authority over or control of any such
  fiduciary, trust, or public funds, may at any time sell any of the bonds
  of the Corporation acquired by them under this section: Provided, That the
  Corporation shall not issue or sell any bonds to the Federal Financing Bank.
  `SEC. 1508. PRICING:
  `a. For purposes of maximizing the long-term economic value of the
  Corporation to the United States Government, the Corporation shall establish
  prices for its products, materials and services provided to customers other
  than the Department on a basis that will, over the long term, allow it
  to recover its costs for providing the products, materials and services;
  repay the Initial Debt; recover costs of decontamination, decommissioning
  and remedial action; and attain the normal business objectives of a
  profitmaking Corporation.
  `b. The Corporation shall establish prices for low assay enrichment services
  and other products, materials, and services provided the Department
  on a basis that will allow it to recover its costs on a yearly basis
  for providing such low assay enrichment services, products, materials,
  and services, including depreciation and the cost of decontamination,
  decommissioning and remedial action, but excluding repayment of the
  Initial Debt and profit. In establishing such prices, the base charge paid
  by the Department in any given year shall not exceed the average base
  charge paid by customers other than the Department: Provided, however,
  That if the imposition of such average base charges as a limitation on
  the base charge paid by the Department in a given year does not permit
  the Corporation to fully recover its costs for providing such products,
  materials and services to the Department then, in subsequent years, the
  Corporation shall include such unrecovered costs in its prices charged
  the Department. Base charge shall mean the amount paid by a customer per
  separative work unit for low assay enrichment services during a given year
  (exclusive of any credits received under a voluntary overfeeding program),
  less the portion of such amount which represents the cost of decontamination
  and decommissioning and remedial action. The average base charge paid by
  customers other than the Department shall be determined by dividing the
  estimated total dollar amount of low assay enrichment services sales to
  customers other than the Department during a given year by the estimated
  amount of separative work units sold to customers other than the Department
  during that year. Adjustments between estimated and actual amounts shall
  be made upon receipt of actual sales data.
  `c. The Corporation shall establish prices to the Department for high assay
  enrichment services on a basis that will allow it to recover its costs,
  on a yearly basis, for providing the products, materials or services,
  including depreciation and the costs of decontamination, decommissioning,
  and remedial action concerning enrichment property, but excluding repayment
  of the Initial Debt and profit. If the Department does not request any
  enrichment services in a given year, the Department shall reimburse the
  Corporation for costs required to maintain the minimum level of operation
  of the high assay production facility.
  `d. (1) In accordance with the cost responsibilities defined in paragraphs
  (3) and (4), the Corporation beginning in fiscal year 1996 shall recover
  from its customers other than the Department in the prices and charges
  established in accordance with subsection (a), amounts that will be
  sufficient to pay for the costs of decommissioning, decontamination and
  remedial action for the various property of the Corporation, including
  property transferred under section 1505(a) at any time. The Corporation
  shall begin recovering such costs in prices and charges to the Department
  at such time as this title takes effect. Such costs shall be based on
  the point in time that such decommissioning, decontamination and remedial
  action are to be undertaken and accomplished: Provided, That by the year
  2000 the Corporation shall have recovered and deposited in the Uranium
  Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Corporate Fund and the
  Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Base Fund 50 per
  centum of the estimated total costs of decontamination and decommissioning
  of all property transferred or to be transferred to the Corporation under
  section 1505, including the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant.
  `(2) In order to meet the objective defined in paragraph (1), the
  Corporation shall periodically estimate the anticipated or actual costs
  of decommissioning and decontamination. Such estimates shall reflect any
  changes in assumptions or expectations relevant to meeting such objective,
  including, but not limited to, any changes in applicable environmental
  requirements. Such estimates shall be reviewed at least every two years.
  `(3) For purposes of enabling the Corporation to meet the objective
  defined in paragraph (1) with respect to the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion
  Plant, the Secretary shall periodically estimate the anticipated

  with other taxpayers or classes of taxpayers.
  `(4) Following the commencement of payments in fiscal year 1996, no
  payment made to any taxing authority for any period shall be less than

Subtitle C
CHAPTER 1--SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS AND PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS
SEC. 4201. TITLE.
  This subtitle may be cited as the `Uranium Security and Tailings Reclamation
  Act of 1989'.
SEC. 4202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds for purposes of this subtitle that--
  (1) the United States uranium industry has long been recognized as vital
  to United States energy independence and as essential to United States
  national security, but has suffered a drastic economic setback, including
  a 90 per centum reduction in employment, closure of almost all mines and
  mills, more than a 75 percent drop in production, and a permanent loss of
  uranium reserves;
  (2) during the remainder of this century approximately 20 per centum of
  United States electricity is expected to be produced from uranium fueled
  powerplants owned by domestic electric utilities;
  (3) the United States has been the leading uranium producing nation and
  holds extensive proven reserves of natural uranium that offer the potential
  for secure sources of future supply;
  (4) a variety of economic factors, policies of foreign governments,
  foreign export practices, the discovery and development of low cost
  foreign reserves, new Federal regulatory requirements, and cancellation
  of nuclear powerplants have caused most United States producers to close
  or suspend operations over the past six years and have resulted in the
  domestic uranium industry being found `not viable' by the Secretary under
  provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended;
  (5) providing assistance to the domestic uranium industry is essential to--
  (A) preclude an undue threat from foreign supply disruptions that could
  hinder the Nation's common defense and security,
  (B) assure an adequate long-term supply of domestic uranium for the
  Nation's nuclear power program to preclude an undue threat from foreign
  supply disruptions or price controls, and
  (C) aid in the Nation's balance-of-trade payments through foreign sales;
  (6) the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (42
  U.S.C. 7901-7942);
  (A) was enacted to provide for the reclamation and regulation of uranium
  and thorium mill tailings; and
  (B) did not provide for a Federal contribution for the reclamation of
  tailings at uranium and thorium processing sites which were generated
  pursuant to Federal defense contracts;
  (7) the owners of licensees of active uranium and thorium sites and the
  Federal Government have each benefited from uranium and thorium produced
  at the active sites, and it is equitable that they share in the costs of
  reclamation, decommissioning and other remedial actions at the commingled
  sites; and
  (B) the creation of an assured system of financing will greatly facilitate

  to the attorney pursuant to this paragraph before the expiration of the

  to subsection (p)(2)(B), the issuer of the policy must make available to
  the individual a medicare supplemental policy with only such core group
  of basic benefits.
  `(3) The issuer of the policy has provided, before the sale of the policy,
  a summary information sheet which describes the benefits (including
  any optional benefits) under the policy, the average ratio of benefits
  provided to premiums collected for the most recent 3-year period in which
  the policy is in effect (or, for a policy that has not been in effect for
  3 years, the average ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected that
  is expected during the 3rd year of the policy) and which allows a direct
  comparison of benefits and prices among policies.
  `(4) In the case of a benefit for which the premium attributable to that
  benefit is at least 75 percent of the nominal value or maximum payout
  of such benefit, the insurer shall disclose to any potential buyer the
  premium and the maximum payout of the benefit.

  `(i) provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the group
  policy, or
  `(ii) provides for such benefits as otherwise meets the requirements of

  `(C) If an individual is a certificateholder in a group medicare supplemental
  policy and the individual terminates membership in the group, the issuer

  subparagraph (B), or
  `(ii) at the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificateholder
  continuation of coverage under the group policy.
  `(D) If a group medicare supplemental policy is replaced by another
  group medicare supplemental policy purchased by the same policyholder,
  the succeeding issuer shall offer coverage to all persons covered under
  the old group policy on its date of termination. Coverage under the new
  group policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions
  that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced.
  `(6)(A) A medicare supplemental policy may not deny a claim for losses
  incurred for a preexisting condition more than 6 months after the effective
  date of coverage and may not define a preexisting condition as a condition
  for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or
  received from a physician more than 6 months before the effective date
  of coverage.
  `(B) If a medicare supplemental policy or certificate replaces another
  such policy or certificate, any period under the policy or certificate
  being replaced during which claims were denied by reason of a preexisting
  condition, exclusion period, rating period, elimination period, or
  probationary period shall be credited toward any such period under the

  only the minimum benefits required of a medicare supplemental policy (as
  of the date of the enactment of this subsection and not including payment
  of any deductibles); and
  `(C) that, subject to paragraph (5)--
  `(i) if the simplification standards provide for medicare supplemental
  insurance benefits to be offered as a core group of basic benefits plus
  a defined list of optional additional benefits to be offered to consumers
  on an optional basis, then the total number of defined optional additional
  benefits offered shall not exceed 10;
  `(ii) if the simplification standards provide for medicare supplemental
  insurance benefits to be offered through defined benefit packages or
  policies, then the total number of different benefit packages (counting

  that may be offered as a separate benefit package) that may be established
  shall not exceed 10; and

  insurance benefits to be offered through defined benefits that the insurer
  packages as it deems appropriate, the total number of packages offered by

  may not exceed 10.
  `(3) The limitations on benefits under paragraph (2) shall, to the extent
  possible--

  direct comparison of prices and benefits among policies, (ii) avoiding
  adverse selection, (iii) providing consumer choice, and (iv) promoting
  market stability.
  `(4) The transitional requirements of this paragraph are that the
  simplification standards shall not apply in the case of a medicare
  supplemental policy which was issued to a policyholder before the effective
  date of such standards.
  `(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no State with a regulatory
  program approved under subsection (b)(1) may provide for or permit the
  grouping of benefits (or language or format with respect to such benefits)
  under a medicare supplemental policy unless such grouping meets the
  applicable simplification standards.
  `(B)(i) The State may, upon application by an insurer, waive the requirements
  of this subsection to permit the issuance and sale of a medicare supplemental
  policy which does not comply with the applicable simplification standards
  in order to offer new or innovative benefits as part of the policy. Any
  such new or innovative benefits shall be offered in a manner as approved
  by the State, which is consistent and practically achievable under the
  simplification standards. Such new or innovative benefits may include
  benefits that are not otherwise available and are cost-effective.
  `(6)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), this subsection shall not
  be construed as preventing a State from restricting the groups of benefits
  that may be offered in medicare supplemental policies in the State.
  `(B) A State with a regulatory program approved under subsection (b)(1) may
  not restrict under subparagraph (A) the offering of a medicare supplemental
  policy consisting only of the core group of benefits described in paragraph

  subsection, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report

  benefit innovation and value of innovative benefits, consumer choice,
  and health care costs and shall include in the report such recommendations

  carrying out such a program as he deems appropriate.'.

  the policy are restricted to items and services furnished by certain
  entities (or reduced benefits are provided when items or services are
  furnished by other entities), the policy shall nevertheless be treated as
  meeting those standards if--
  `(1) full benefits are provided for items and services furnished through
  a network of entities which have entered into contracts with the issuer
  of the policy;
  `(2) full benefits are provided for items and services furnished by
  other entities if the services are medically necessary and immediately
  required because of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition and it
  is not reasonable given the circumstances to obtain the services through
  the network;
  `(3) the network offers sufficient access; and
  `(4) the issuer of the policy has arrangements for an ongoing quality

  Regulation previously promulgated for purposes of this section to incorporate
  all the requirements and standards of subsections (o), (p), (q), and (r),
  and other changes in law made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
  1990, then subsection (g)(2)(A) shall be applied in each State, effective
  for policies issued to policyholders on and after the date specified in
  paragraph (3), as if the reference to the Model Regulation adopted on June
  6, 1979, included a reference to the NAIC simplification standards.
  `(B) If the Association does not promulgate NAIC simplification standards
  within the 9-month period specified in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall
  promulgate, not later than 9 months after the end of such period, revised
  Federal model standards to incorporate all the requirements and standards
  of subsections (o), (p), (q), and (r), and other changes in law made by the
  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and subsection (g)(2)(A) shall
  be applied in each State, effective for policies issued to policyholders
  on and after the date specified in subparagraph (C), as if the reference
  to the Model Regulation adopted on June 6, 1979, included a reference to
  the revised Federal model standards.
  `(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the date specified in this paragraph for a
  State is the date the State adopts the NAIC simplification standards or the
  Federal simplification standards or 1 year after the date the Association
  or the Secretary first adopts such standards, whichever is earlier.
  `(ii) In the case of a State which the Secretary identifies, in consultation
  with the Association, as--
  `(I) requiring State legislation (other than legislation appropriating
  funds) in order for medicare supplemental policies to meet the NAIC or
  Federal simplification standards, but
  `(II) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet in 1991 in a
  legislative session in which such legislation may be considered,
the date specified in this subparagraph is the first day of the first calendar
quarter beginning after the close of the first legislative session of the
State legislature that begins on or after January 1, 1991. For purposes of
the previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative
session, each year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular
session of the State legislature.
  `(2) By not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this
  subsection, the Secretary shall report to the Congress on the adoption of
  the standards and requirements of this section, including the identification
  of those States which do and do not have regulatory programs that meet the
  requirements of this section, and the reasons for the failure of any States
  to adopt some or all of the standards and requirements of this section.
  `(3) In promulgating simplification standards under subsection (p)(1),
  the Association or Secretary shall consult with a working group composed
  of representatives of issuers of medicare supplemental policies, consumer
  groups, medicare beneficiaries, and other qualified individuals. Such
  representatives shall be selected in a manner so as to assure balanced
  representation among the interested groups.
  `(4)(A) Every 3 years the Secretary shall, in consultation with the NAIC,
  evaluate the appropriateness of new or innovative benefits offered pursuant
  to subsection (p)(5)(B), and determine whether the incorporation of such
  new or innovative benefits into the simplification standards would further
  the purposes of such standards. If within 90 days after a request from
  the Secretary, the Association--
  `(i) makes a determination that modification of the NAIC or Federal
  simplification standards is appropriate; and
  `(ii) modifies the NAIC or Federal simplification standards to include
  such additional group of benefits (including accompanying language and
  format with respect to such benefits),
subsection (g)(2)(A) shall be applied in each State, effective for policies
issued to policyholders on or after the date specified in subparagraph
(B), as if the reference to the Model Regulation adopted on June 6, 1979
included a reference to the NAIC or Federal simplification standards as
modified. If the Association fails to make a determination with respect to
appropriateness of modifying the NAIC or Federal simplification standards,
then the Secretary may make such determination and may modify the NAIC
or Federal simplification standards to include such additional benefits
(including accompanying language and format with respect to such benefits)
as may be appropriate. In such a case, subsection (g)(2)(A) shall be applied
in each State, effective for policies issued to policyholders on or after
the date specified in subparagraph (B), as if the reference to the Model
Regulation adopted on June 6, 1979 included a reference to the NAIC or
Federal simplification standards as modified.
  `(B) The date specified in this subparagraph for a State is the earlier
  of the date the State adopts the modifications to the NAIC or Federal
  simplification standards or 1 year after the date the Association or the
  Secretary first adopts the modifications to such standards, except that,
  in the case of a State that the Secretary identifies, in consultation with
  the Association, as--
  `(i) requiring State legislation (other than appropriating funds) in order
  for medicare supplemental policies to meet the modified NAIC or Federal
  simplification standards, but
  `(ii) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet within the
  1-year period after the date the Association or Secretary first adopts
  the modifications to such standards,
the date specified in this subparagraph is the first day of the first
calendar year after the close of the first legislative session of the State
legislature that begins after the date the Association or the Secretary
first adopts such modifications. For the purposes of the previous sentence,
in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of
the legislative session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of
the State legislature.
  `(5) If benefits under this title are changed and the Secretary determines,
  in consultation with the Association, that changes in the simplification
  standards are needed to reflect such changes in benefits, the provisions
  for the modification of simplification standards outlined in paragraph
  (4)(A) will be applied.'.

  furnishes to such program through the provision of clinical services by
  nursing or allied health students incidental to their training, or the

  of an alternative cost reporting period other than that which began during
  fiscal year 1984 for purposes of determining the average amount recognized
  as reasonable medical education costs of the hospital for each full-time
  equivalent resident. The Secretary shall review each such request and
  determine whether it would be appropriate to provide for an FTE resident
  amount based on an alternative cost reporting period, based on approved
  FTE resident amounts for comparable programs. If the Secretary approves a
  request under this clause, payments based on alternative cost reporting

  `(3) AUTHORIZING PAYMENT FOR DRUGS NOT COVERED UNDER REBATE AGREEMENTS-
  Paragraph (1), and section 1903(i)(10)(A), shall not apply to the dispensing
  of a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug if (A) the State
  has made a determination that the availability of the drug is essential to
  the health of beneficiaries under the State plan for medical assistance; and
  (B)(i) the physician has obtained approval for use of the drug in advance of
  its dispensing in accordance with a prior authorization program described

  `(4) EFFECT ON EXISTING AGREEMENTS- In the case of a rebate agreement in
  effect between a State and a manufacturer on the date of the enactment of
  this section, such agreement, for the initial agreement period specified
  therein, shall be considered to be a rebate agreement in compliance with
  this section with respect to that State, if the State agrees to report
  to the Secretary any rebates paid pursuant to the agreement. If the State
  establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the agreement provides
  for rebates that are at least as large as the rebates otherwise required
  under this section, and the State agrees to report any rebates under the
  agreement to the Secretary, the agreement shall be considered to be a
  rebate agreement in compliance with the section for the renewal periods
  of such agreement.
  `(b) TERMS OF REBATE AGREEMENT-
  `(1) PERIODIC REBATES-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- A rebate agreement under this subsection shall require
  the manufacturer to provide, to each State plan approved under this title,
  a rebate each calendar quarter (or periodically in accordance with a
  schedule specified by the Secretary) in an amount specified in subsection
  (c) for covered outpatient drugs of the manufacturer dispensed under
  the plan during the quarter (or such other period as the Secretary may
  specify). Such rebate shall be paid by the manufacturer not later than 30
  days after the date of receipt of the information described in paragraph
  (2) for the period involved.
  `(B) OFFSET AGAINST MEDICAL ASSISTANCE- Amounts received by a State under
  this section (or under an agreement authorized by the Secretary under
  subsection (a)(1) or an agreement described in subsection (a)(4)) in
  any quarter shall be considered to be a reduction in the amount expended
  under the State plan in the quarter for medical assistance for purposes
  of section 1903(a)(1).
  `(2) STATE PROVISION OF INFORMATION-
  `(A) STATE RESPONSIBILITY- Each State agency under this title shall
  report to each manufacturer not later than 60 days after the end of each
  calendar quarter and in a form consistent with a standard reporting format
  established by the Secretary, information on the total number of dosage
  units of each covered outpatient drug dispensed under the plan during the
  quarter, and shall promptly transmit a copy of such report to the Secretary.
  `(B) AUDITS- A manufacturer may audit the information provided (or required
  to be provided) under subparagraph (A). Adjustments to rebates shall be
  made to the extent that information indicates that utilization was greater
  or less than the amount previously specified.
  `(C) NOTICE TO SECRETARY- Each State agency shall notify the Secretary
  within 30 days after the date each rebate is received under this section.
  `(3) MANUFACTURER PROVISION OF PRICE INFORMATION-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- Each manufacturer with an agreement in effect under this
  section shall report to the Secretary--
  `(i) not later than 30 days after the last day of each quarter (beginning
  on or after January 1, 1991), on the average manufacturer price (as defined
  in subsection (k)(1)) and, effective for quarters beginning on or after
  January 1, 1994 (for single source drugs and innovator multiple source
  drugs), the manufacturer's best price (as defined in subsection (c)(2)(B))
  for covered outpatient drugs for the quarter, and
  `(ii) not later than 30 days after the date of entering into an agreement
  under this section on the average manufacturer price (as defined in
  subsection (k)(1)) as of October 1, 1990 for each of the manufacturer's
  covered outpatient drugs.
  `(B) VERIFICATION SURVEYS OF AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE- The Secretary may
  survey wholesalers and manufacturers that directly distribute their covered
  outpatient drugs, when necessary, to verify average manufacturer prices
  reported under subparagraph (A). The Secretary may impose a civil monetary
  penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 on a wholesaler, manufacturer,
  or direct seller, if the wholesaler, manufacturer, or direct seller of a
  covered outpatient drug refuses a request for information about charges or
  prices by the Secretary in connection with a survey under this subparagraph
  or knowingly provides false information. The provisions of section 1128A
  (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty
  under this subparagraph in the same manner as such provisions apply to a
  penalty or proceeding under section 1128A(a).
  `(C) PENALTIES-
  `(i) FAILURE TO PROVIDE TIMELY INFORMATION- In the case of a manufacturer
  with an agreement under this section that fails to provide information
  required under subparagraph (A) on a timely basis, the amount of the rebate
  required under the agreement shall be increased by $10,000 for each day in
  which such information has not been provided, and, if such information is
  not reported within 90 days of the deadline imposed, the agreement shall
  be suspended for services furnished after the end of such 90-day period
  and until the date such information is reported (but in no case shall such
  suspension be for a period of less than 30 days).
  `(ii) FALSE INFORMATION- Any manufacturer with an agreement under this
  section that knowingly provides false information is subject to a civil
  money penalty in an amount not to exceed $100,000 for each item of false
  information. Such civil money penalties are in addition to other penalties
  as may be prescribed by law. The provisions of section 1128A (other than
  subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this
  subparagraph in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or
  proceeding under section 1128A(a).
  `(D) CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION- Notwithstanding any other provision
  of law, information disclosed by manufacturers or wholesalers under this
  paragraph is confidential and shall not be disclosed by the Secretary or
  a State agency (or contractor therewith) in a form which discloses the
  identity of a specific manufacturer or wholesaler, except as the Secretary
  determines to be necessary to carry out this section and to permit the
  Comptroller General to review the information provided.
  `(4) LENGTH OF AGREEMENT-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- A rebate agreement shall be effective for an initial
  period of no less than 1 year and shall be automatically renewed for a
  period of no less than one year unless terminated under subparagraph (B).

  agreement for violation of the requirements of the agreement or other good
  cause shown. Such termination shall not be effective earlier than 60 days
  after the date of notice of such termination. The Secretary shall provide,
  upon request, a manufacturer with a hearing concerning such a termination,
  but such hearing shall not delay the effective date of the termination.
  `(ii) BY A MANUFACTURER- A manufacturer may terminate a rebate agreement
  under this section for any reason. Any such termination shall not be
  effective until such period after the date of the notice as the Secretary
  may provide (but not beyond the term of the agreement).
  `(iii) EFFECTIVENESS OF TERMINATION- Any termination under this subparagraph
  shall not affect rebates due under the agreement before the effective date
  of its termination.
  `(C) DELAY BEFORE REENTRY- In the case of any rebate agreement with a
  manufacturer under this section which is terminated, another such agreement
  with the manufacturer (or a successor manufacturer) may not be entered
  into until a period of 1 calendar quarter has elapsed since the date of
  the termination, unless the Secretary finds good cause for an earlier
  reinstatement of such an agreement.

  before January 1, 1994, 15 percent of the average manufacturer price for
  each dosage form and strength of such drugs (after deducting customary
  prompt payment discounts) for the quarter (or other period), and
  `(ii) for quarters (or other periods) beginning after December 31, 1993,
  the greater of--

  under this title in the quarter (or other period) reported by the State
  under subsection (b)(2).
  `(2) ADDITIONAL REBATE FOR SINGLE SOURCE AND INNOVATOR MULTIPLE SOURCE DRUGS-
  (A) The Secretary shall establish a method of adjusting the basic rebate
  specified under paragraph (1) for single source and innovator multiple
  source drugs of a manufacturer to ensure that a manufacturer's prices for
  such drugs to a State plan approved under this title, determined on an
  aggregate weighted average basis, using the average manufacturer price for
  each such drug, do not increase by a percentage that is greater than the
  increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (U.S. average)
  from October 1, 1990 to the month before the beginning of the calendar
  quarter (or other period) involved.
  `(B) In this subsection, the term `best price' means, with respect to a
  single source drug or innovator multiple source drug of a manufacturer, the

  nonprofit entity, or governmental entity within the United States (excluding
  depot prices of any agency of the Federal Government). The best price shall
  be inclusive of cash discounts, free goods, volume discounts, and rebates
  (other than rebates under this section) and shall be determined without
  regard to special packaging, labeling, or identifiers on the dosage form
  or product or package, and shall not take into account prices that are
  merely nominal in amount.
  `(3) REBATE FOR OTHER DRUGS- The amount of the rebate to a State for a
  calendar quarter (or other period specified by the Secretary) with respect
  to covered outpatient drugs (other than single source drugs and innovator
  multiple source drugs) shall be equal to the product of--

  defined in (k)(6));
  `(ii) the drug is contained in the list referred to in paragraph (2); or
  `(iii) the drug is subject to such restrictions pursuant to an agreement
  between a manufacturer and a State authorized by the Secretary under
  subsection (a)(1) or in effect pursuant to subsection (a)(4).

  pay to each State an amount equal to 75 per centum of so much of the sums
  expended by the State plan during calendar years 1991 through 1993 as the
  Secretary determines is attributable to the statewide adoption of a drug
  use review program which conforms to the requirements of this subsection.
  `(D) States shall not be required to perform additional drug use reviews
  with respect to drugs dispensed to residents of nursing facilities which
  are in compliance with the drug regimen review procedures prescribed by
  the Secretary for such facilities in regulations implementing section 1919,

  (consistent with State law respecting the provision of such information),
  the pharmacist deems significant including the following:
  `(aa) The name and description of the medication.
  `(bb) The route, dosage form, dosage, route of administration, and duration
  of drug therapy.
  `(cc) Special directions and precautions for preparation, administration
  and use by the patient.

  the compendia and literature referred to in subsection (1)(B) as the source
  of standards for such assessment) including but not limited to monitoring
  for therapeutic appropriateness, overutilization and underutilization,
  appropriate use of generic products, therapeutic duplication, drug-disease
  contraindications, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or
  duration of drug treatment, and clinical abuse/misuse and, as necessary,
  introduce remedial strategies, in order to improve the quality of care
  and to conserve program funds or personal expenditures.
  `(D) EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM- The program shall, through its State drug
  use review board established under paragraph (3), either directly or

  care, and of State community care settings in which such care is provided,
  with the requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h).

  under this subsection shall occur no less frequently than once every
  12 months.

  community care settings must be based on a survey. Such survey for such a
  setting must be conducted without prior notice to the setting. Any individual
  who notifies (or causes to be notified) a community care setting of the time

  respecting compliance with the requirements of subsection (g) or (h) or who
  has a personal or familial financial interest in the setting being surveyed.
  `(D) SPECIAL SURVEYS OF COMPLIANCE- Where the Secretary has reason
  to question the compliance of a community care setting with any of the
  requirements of subsection (g) or (h), the Secretary may conduct a survey
  of the setting and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and
  binding determinations concerning the extent to which the setting meets
  such requirements.
  `(4) INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS AND MONITORING OF PROVIDERS AND SETTINGS-
  Each State and the Secretary shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to
  investigate complaints of violations of applicable requirements imposed on
  providers of community care or on community care settings under subsections
  (f), (g) and (h).

  MISAPPROPRIATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY- The State shall provide, through
  the agency responsible for surveys and certification of providers of
  home or community care and community care settings under this subsection,
  for a process for the receipt, review, and investigation of allegations
  of individual neglect and abuse (including injuries of unknown source) by
  personnel providing such care or in such setting and of misappropriation
  of individual property by such personnel. Such process shall provide for
  documentation of findings relating to such allegations with respect to an

  `(i) a provider of home or community care has provided care of substandard
  quality with respect to an individual, the State shall make a reasonable
  effort to notify promptly (I) an immediate family member of each such
  individual and (II) individuals receiving home or community care from that
  provider under this title, or
  `(ii) a community care setting is substandard, the State shall make a
  reasonable effort to notify promptly (I) individuals receiving community
  care in that setting, and (II) immediate family members of such individuals.
  `(C) ACCESS TO FRAUD CONTROL UNITS- Each State shall provide its State
  medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under section 1903(q))
  with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys,
  reviews, and certifications under this subsection.
  `(j) ENFORCEMENT PROCESS FOR PROVIDERS OF COMMUNITY CARE-
  `(1) STATE AUTHORITY-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- If a State finds, on the basis of a review under
  subsection (i)(2) or otherwise, that a provider of home or community care
  no longer meets the requirements of this section, the State may terminate
  the provider's participation under the State plan and may provide in
  addition for a civil money penalty. Nothing in this subparagraph shall
  be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy
  a provider's deficiencies. If the State finds that a provider meets such
  requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements,
  the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A) for
  the period during which it finds that the provider was not in compliance
  with such requirements.
  `(B) CIVIL MONEY PENALTY-
  `(i) IN GENERAL- Each State shall establish by law (whether statute or
  regulation) at least the following remedy: A civil money penalty assessed
  and collected, with interest, for each day in which the provider is or
  was out of compliance with a requirement of this section. Funds collected
  by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result
  of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty under subsection
  (i)(3)(A)) may be applied to reimbursement of individuals for personal
  funds lost due to a failure of home or community care providers to meet
  the requirements of this section. The State also shall specify criteria,
  as to when and how this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any
  penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between
  the identification of violations and final imposition of the penalties and
  shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties
  for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.
  `(ii) DEADLINE AND GUIDANCE- Each State which elects to provide home
  and community care under this section must establish the civil money
  penalty remedy described in clause (i) applicable to all providers of
  community care covered under this section. The Secretary shall provide,
  through regulations or otherwise by not later than July 1, 1990, guidance
  to States in establishing such remedy; but the failure of the Secretary
  to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility
  for establishing such remedy.
  `(2) SECRETARIAL AUTHORITY-
  `(A) FOR STATE PROVIDERS- With respect to a State provider of home or
  community care, the Secretary shall have the authority and duties of a
  State under this subsection, except that the civil money penalty remedy
  described in subparagraph (C) shall be substituted for the civil money
  remedy described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).
  `(B) OTHER PROVIDERS- With respect to any other provider of home or community
  care in a State, if the Secretary finds that a provider no longer meets a
  requirement of this section, the Secretary may terminate the provider's
  participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for a
  civil money penalty under subparagraph (C). If the Secretary finds that
  a provider meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did
  not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money
  penalty under subparagraph (C) for the period during which the Secretary
  finds that the provider was not in compliance with such requirements.
  `(C) CIVIL MONEY PENALTY- If the Secretary finds on the basis of a review
  under subsection (i)(2) or otherwise that a home or community care provider
  no longer meets the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall impose
  a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of
  noncompliance. The provisions of section 1128A (other than subsections (a)
  and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in
  the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under
  section 1128A(a). The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how
  this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria
  shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification
  of violations and final imposition of the penalties and shall provide
  for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for repeated or
  uncorrected deficiencies.
  `(k) SECRETARIAL RESPONSIBILITIES-
  `(1) PUBLICATION OF INTERIM REQUIREMENTS-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall publish, by December 1, 1991,

  to such requirements.
  `(B) MINIMUM PROTECTIONS- Interim requirements under subparagraph (A) and
  final requirements under paragraph (2) shall assure, through methods other

  abuse, financial exploitation, inappropriate involuntary restraint, and
  the provision of health care services by unqualified personnel in community
  care settings.
  `(2) DEVELOPMENT OF FINAL REQUIREMENTS- The Secretary shall develop,
  by not later than October 1, 1992--
  `(A) final requirements, consistent with paragraph (1)(B), respecting the
