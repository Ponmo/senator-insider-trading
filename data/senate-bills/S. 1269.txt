SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of

SEC. 2. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Statement of Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to 
achieve, through trade agreements affording mutual benefits--
            (1) more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access for 
        United States goods, services, and investment;
            (2) the reduction or elimination of barriers and other 
        trade-distorting policies and practices;
            (3) a more effective system of international trading 
        disciplines and procedures; and
            (4) economic growth, higher living standards, and full 
        employment in the United States, and economic growth and 
        development among United States trading partners.
    (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The principal trade 
negotiating objectives of the United States for agreements subject to 
the provisions of section 3 include the following:
            (1) Reduction of barriers to trade in goods.--The principal 
        negotiating objective of the United States regarding barriers 
        to trade in goods is to obtain competitive opportunities for 
        United States exports in foreign markets substantially 
        equivalent to the opportunities afforded foreign exports to 
        United States markets, including the reduction or elimination 
        of tariff and nontariff trade barriers, including--
                    (A) tariff and nontariff disparities remaining from 
                previous rounds of multilateral trade negotiations that 
                have put United States exports at a competitive 
                disadvantage in world markets;
                    (B) measures identified in the annual report 
                prepared under section 181 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 
                U.S.C. 2241); and
                    (C) tariff elimination for products identified in 
                section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 
                U.S.C. 3521(b)) and the accompanying Statement of 
                Administrative Action related to that section.
            (2) Trade in services.--
                    (A) The principal negotiating objectives of the 
                United States regarding trade in services are--
                            (i) to reduce or eliminate barriers to, or 
                        other distortions of, international trade in 
                        services, including regulatory and other 
                        barriers that deny national treatment or 
                        unreasonably restrict the establishment and 
operation of service suppliers in foreign markets; and
                            (ii) to develop internationally agreed 
                        rules, including dispute settlement procedures, 
                        that--
                                    (I) are consistent with the 
                                commercial policies of the United 
                                States, and
                                    (II) will reduce or eliminate such 
                                barriers or distortions, and help 
                                ensure fair, equitable opportunities 
                                for foreign markets.
                    (B) In pursuing the negotiating objectives 
                described in subparagraph (A), United States 
                negotiators shall take into account legitimate United

                        trade-distorting barriers to foreign 
                        investment, to expand the principle of national 
                        treatment, and to reduce unreasonable barriers 
                        to establishment; and
                            (ii) to develop internationally agreed 
                        rules through the negotiation of investment 
                        agreements, including dispute settlement 
                        procedures, that--
                                    (I) will help ensure a free flow of 
                                foreign investment, and
                                    (II) will reduce or eliminate the 
                                trade distortive effects of certain

                legitimate health, safety, essential security, 
                environmental, consumer, and employment opportunity 
                interests. The preceding sentence shall not be 
                construed to authorize any modification of United 
                States law.
            (4) Intellectual property.--The principal negotiating

                unpredictable markets;
                    (C) creating a free and more open world 
                agricultural trading system by resolving questions 
                pertaining to export and other trade-distorting 
                subsidies, market pricing, and market access;
                    (D) eliminating or reducing substantially other 
                specific constraints to fair trade and more open market 
                access, such as tariffs, quotas, and other nontariff

                    (E) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules

                        price transparency;
                            (ii) unjustified restrictions or commercial

                        including biotechnology;
                            (iii) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary 
                        restrictions;
                            (iv) other unjustified technical barriers 
                        to trade; and

                persistent use of, and otherwise discipline, unfair 
                trade practices having adverse trade effects, including 
                forms of subsidy and dumping not adequately

                diversionary dumping, dumped or subsidized inputs, 
                third country dumping, circumvention of antidumping or 
                countervailing duty orders, and export targeting 
                practices; and
                    (B) to obtain the enforcement of WTO rules 
                against--
                            (i) trade-distorting practices of state 
                        trading enterprises, and
                            (ii) the acts, practices, or policies of 
                        any foreign government which, as a practical

                measure of responsibility for achieving and maintaining 
                an open international trading system by providing 
                reciprocal benefits and assuming equivalent obligations 
                with respect to their import and export practices; and
                    (B) to establish procedures for reducing 
                nonreciprocal trade benefits for the more advanced 
                developing countries.
            (12) Current account surpluses.--The principal negotiating 
        objective of the United States regarding current account 
        surpluses is to promote policies to address large and 
        persistent global current account imbalances of countries 
        (including imbalances which threaten the stability of the 
        international trading system), by imposing greater 
        responsibility on such countries to undertake policy changes 
        aimed at restoring current account equilibrium through 
        expedited implementation of trade agreements where feasible and 
        appropriate.
            (13) Access to high technology.--
                    (A) The principal negotiating objective of the 
                United States regarding access to high technology is to 
                obtain the elimination or reduction of foreign barriers 
                to, and acts, policies, or practices by foreign 
                governments which limit, equitable access by United 
                States persons to foreign-developed technology, 
                including barriers, acts, policies, or practices which 
                have the effect of--
                            (i) restricting the participation of United 
                        States persons in government-supported research 
                        and development projects;
                            (ii) denying equitable access by United 
                        States persons to government-held patents;
                            (iii) requiring the approval of government 
                        entities, or imposing other forms of government 
                        intervention, as a condition of granting 
                        licenses to United States persons by foreign 
                        persons (other than approval which may be 
                        necessary for national security purposes to 
                        control the export of critical military 
                        technology); and
                            (iv) otherwise denying equitable access by 
                        United States persons to foreign-developed 
                        technology or contributing to the inequitable 
                        flow of technology between the United States 
                        and its trading partners.
                    (B) In pursuing the negotiating objective described 
                in subparagraph (A), the United States negotiators 
                shall take into account United States Government 
                policies in licensing or otherwise making available to 
                foreign persons technology and other information 
                developed by United States laboratories.
            (14) Border taxes.--The principal negotiating objective of 
        the United States regarding border taxes is, within the WTO, to 
obtain a revision of the treatment of border adjustments for internal 
taxes in order to redress the disadvantage to countries that rely 
primarily on direct taxes rather than indirect taxes for revenue.
            (15) Regulatory competition.--The principal trade 
        negotiating objectives of the United States regarding the use 
        of government regulation or other practices by foreign 
        governments to provide a competitive advantage to their 
        domestic producers, service providers, or investors and thereby 
        reduce market access for United States goods, services, and 
        investment are--
                    (A) to ensure that government regulation and other 
                government practices do not unfairly discriminate 
                against United States goods, services, or investment; 
                and
                    (B) to prevent the use of foreign government 
                regulation and other government practices, including 
                the lowering of, or derogation from, existing labor 
                (including child labor), health and safety, or 
                environmental standards, for the purpose of attracting 
                investment or inhibiting United States exports.
        Nothing in subparagraph (B) shall be construed to authorize in 
        an implementing bill, or in an agreement subject to an 
        implementing bill, the inclusion of provisions that would 
        restrict the autonomy of the United States in these areas.
    (c) International Economic Policy Objectives Designed To Reinforce 
the Trade Agreements Process.--
            (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States to 
        reinforce the trade agreements process by--
                    (A) fostering stability in international currency 
                markets and developing mechanisms to assure greater 
                coordination, consistency, and cooperation between 
                international trade and monetary systems and 
                institutions in order to protect against the trade 
                consequences of significant and unanticipated currency 
                movements;
                    (B) supplementing and strengthening standards for 
                protection of intellectual property rights under 
                conventions designed to protect such rights that are 
                administered by international organizations other than 
                the WTO, expanding the conventions to cover new and 
                emerging technologies, and eliminating discrimination 
                and unreasonable exceptions or preconditions to such 
                protection;
                    (C) promoting respect for workers' rights, by--
                            (i) reviewing the relationship between 
                        workers' rights and the operation of 
                        international trading systems and specific 
                        trade arrangements; and
                            (ii) seeking to establish in the 
                        International Labor Organization (referred to 
                        in this Act as the ``ILO'') a mechanism for the 
                        systematic examination of, and reporting on, 
                        the extent to which ILO members promote and 
                        enforce the freedom of association, the right 
                        to organize and bargain collectively, a 
                        prohibition on the use of forced labor, a 
                        prohibition on exploitative child labor, and a 
                        prohibition on discrimination in employment; 
                        and
                    (D) expanding the production of goods and trade in 
                goods and services to ensure the optimal use of the 
                world's resources, while seeking to protect and 
                preserve the environment and to enhance the 
                international means for doing so.
            (2) Application of procedures.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed to authorize the use of the trade agreement 
        approval procedures described in section 3 to modify United 
        States law.

SEC. 3. TRADE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY.

    (a) Agreements Regarding Tariff Barriers.--
            (1) In general.--Whenever the President determines that 1 
        or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any 
        foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and 
        restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the 
        purposes, policies, and objectives of this Act will be promoted 
        thereby, the President--
                    (A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign 
                countries before--
                            (i) October 1, 2001, or
                            (ii) October 1, 2005, if the authority 
                        provided by this Act is extended under 
                        subsection (c); and
                    (B) may, consistent with paragraphs (2) through 
                (5), proclaim--
                            (i) such modification or continuance of any 
                        existing duty,
                            (ii) such continuance of existing duty-free 
                        or excise treatment, or
                            (iii) such additional duties,
                as the President determines to be required or 
                appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.
            (2) Limitations.--No proclamation may be made under 
        paragraph (1) that--
                    (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of 
                duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on the 
                date of enactment of this Act) to a rate which is less 
                than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies 
                on such date of enactment;
                    (B) provides for a reduction of duty on an article 
                to take effect on a date that is more than 10 years 
                after the first reduction that is proclaimed to carry 
                out a trade agreement with respect to such article; or
                    (C) increases any rate of duty above the rate that 
                applied on the date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Aggregate reduction; exemption from staging.--
                    (A) Aggregate reduction.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate 
                of duty on any article which is in effect on any day 
                pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under 
                paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction 
                which would have been in effect on such day if--
                            (i) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or 
                        a reduction of one-tenth of the total 
                        reduction, whichever is greater, had taken 
                        effect on the effective date of the first 
                        reduction proclaimed under paragraph (1) to 
                        carry out such agreement with respect to such 
                        article; and
                            (ii) a reduction equal to the amount 
                        applicable under clause (i) had taken effect at 
                        1-year intervals after the effective date of 
                        such first reduction.
                    (B) Exemption from staging.--No staging under 
                subparagraph (A) is required with respect to a rate 
                reduction that is proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an 
                article of a kind that is not produced in the United 
                States. The United States International Trade 
                Commission shall advise the President of the identity 
                of articles that may be exempted from staging under 
                this subparagraph.
            (4) Rounding.--If the President determines that such action 
        will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph 
        (3), the President may round an annual reduction by the lesser 
        of--
                    (A) the difference between the reduction without 
                regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole 
                number; or
                    (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
            (5) Other limitations.--A rate of duty reduction or 
        increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) 
        may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction 
        or increase is included within an implementing bill provided 
        for under section 5 and that bill is enacted into law.
            (6) Expanded tariff proclamation authority.--
                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of 
                paragraphs (1) through (5), before October 1, 2001 (or 
                before October 1, 2005, if the authority provided by 
                this Act is extended under subsection (c)), and subject 
                to the consultation and layover requirements of section 
                115 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 
                3524) and the notification and consultation 
                requirements of section 4(a) of this Act, the President 
                may proclaim the modification of any duty or staged 
                rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX, as 
                defined in section 2(5) of the Uruguay Round Agreements 
                Act, if the United States has agreed to such 
                modification or staged rate reduction in a negotiation 
                for the reciprocal elimination or harmonization of 
                duties, within the same tariff categories, under the 
                auspices of the World Trade Organization or as part of 
                an interim agreement leading to the formation of a 
                regional free-trade area.
                    (B) Notice required.--The modification or staged 
                rate reduction authorized under subparagraph (A) with 
                respect to any negotiation initiated after the date of 
                enactment of this Act may be proclaimed only on 
                articles in tariff categories with respect to which the 
                President has provided notice in accordance with 
                section 4(a).
            (7) Tariff modifications under uruguay round agreements 
        act.--Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority 
        provided to the President under section 111(b) of the Uruguay 
        Round Agreements Act.
    (b) Agreements Regarding Tariff and Nontariff Barriers.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) Determination by president.--Whenever the 
                President determines that--
                            (i) any duty or other import restriction 
                        imposed by any foreign country or the United 
                        States or any other barrier to, or other 
                        distortion of, international trade--
                                    (I) unduly burdens or restricts the 
                                foreign trade of the United States or 
                                adversely affects the United States 
                                economy, or
                                    (II) is likely to result in such a 
                                burden, restriction, or effect, and
                            (ii) the purposes, policies, and objectives 
                        of this Act will be promoted thereby,
                the President may, before October 1, 2001 (or before

                Act is extended under subsection (c)) enter into a 
                trade agreement described in subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Trade agreement described.--A trade agreement 
                described in this subparagraph means an agreement with 
                a foreign country that provides for--
                            (i) the reduction or elimination of such 
                        duty, restriction, barrier, or other 
                        distortion; or
                            (ii) the prohibition of, or limitation on 
                        the imposition of, such barrier or other 
                        distortion.
            (2) Conditions.--A trade agreement may be entered into 
        under this subsection only if--
                    (A) such agreement makes progress in meeting the 
                applicable objectives described in section 2(b); and
                    (B) the President satisfies the conditions set 
                forth in section 4 with respect to such agreement.
            (3) Bills qualifying for trade agreement approval 
        procedures.--The provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act of 
        1974 (in this Act referred to as ``trade agreement approval 
        procedures'') apply to implementing bills submitted with 
        respect to trade agreements entered into under this subsection, 
        except that, for purposes of applying section 151(b)(1), such 
        implementing bills shall contain only--
                    (A) provisions that approve a trade agreement 
                entered into under this subsection that achieves one or 
                more of the principal negotiating objectives set forth 
                in section 2(b) and the statement of administrative 
                action (if any) proposed to implement such trade 
                agreement;
                    (B) provisions that are--
                            (i) necessary to implement such agreement; 
                        or
                            (ii) otherwise related to the 
                        implementation, enforcement, and adjustment to 
                        the effects of such trade agreement and are 
                        directly related to trade; and
                    (C) provisions necessary for purposes of complying 
                with section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
                Deficit Control Act of 1985 in implementing the 
                applicable trade agreement.
    (c) Extension Procedures.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in section 5(b)--
                    (A) subsections (a) and (b) shall apply with

                notice or consultations with respect to that trade 
                agreement, the other House separately agrees to a 
                procedural disapproval resolution with respect to that
