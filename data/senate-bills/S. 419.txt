A BILL
To provide for the collection of data about crimes motivated by race,
religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
  States of America in Congress assembled, That (a) this Act may be cited
  as the `Hate Crime Statistics Act'.
  (b)(1) Under the authority of section 534 of title 28, United States Code,
  the Attorney General shall acquire data, for the calendar year 1990 and each
  of the succeeding 4 calendar years, about crimes that manifest evidence
  of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity,
  including where appropriate the crimes of murder, non-negligent manslaughter;
  forcible rape; aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation; arson;
  and destruction, damage or vandalism of property.
  (2) The Attorney General shall establish guidelines for the collection
  of such data including the necessary evidence and criteria that must be
  present for a finding of manifest prejudice and procedures for carrying
  out the purposes of this section.
  (3) Nothing in this section creates a cause of action or a right to bring
  an action, including an action based on discrimination due to sexual
  orientation. As used in this section, the term `sexual orientation' means
  consensual homosexuality or heterosexuality. This subsection does not
  limit any existing cause of action or right to bring an action, including
  any action under the Administrative Procedure Act or the All Writs Act.
  (4) Data acquired under this section shall be used only for research or
  statistical purposes and may not contain any information that may reveal
  the identity of an individual victim of a crime.
  (5) The Attorney General shall publish an annual summary of the data
  acquired under this section.
  (c) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary
  to carry out the provisions of this section through fiscal year 1994. Biden,
  without amendment
