    (b) Point of Order.--In the Senate, it shall not be in order to

Appropriations amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of 
the Social Security Administration.
    (b) Special Rule.--In the House, for purposes of applying section

Security Administration.

SEC. 409. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.

    Congress adopts the provisions of this title--
        (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and 
    the House, respectively, and as such they shall be considered as

        (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either

display an amount to reflect a committee's instruction under the 
reconciliation process, but it shall not constitute an allocation 
within the meaning of section 302 of such Act. Changes in levels of

title II of this resolution shall not be included in current levels of 
new budget authority and outlays for purposes of enforcing an 
allocation under 302(a) of such Act.

SEC. 411. SPECIAL PROCEDURES TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS IN MANDATORY SPENDING 
              THROUGH FY2014.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--The Congress finds that--
        (1) the share of the budget consumed by mandatory spending has 
    been growing since the mid-1970s, and now is about 54 percent;
        (2) this portion of the budget is continuing to grow, crowding 
    out other priorities and threatening overall budget control;
        (3) mandatory spending is intrinsically difficult to control;
        (4) these programs are subject to a variety of factors outside 
    the control of Congress, such as demographics, economic conditions, 
    and medical prices;
        (5) Congress should make an effort at least every other year, 
    to review mandatory spending;
        (6) the reconciliation process set forth in the Congressional 
    Budget Act of 1974 is a viable tool to reduce the rate of growth in 
    mandatory spending; and
        (7) concurrent resolutions on the budget for fiscal years 2007 
    through 2010 should include reconciliation instructions to 
    committees, every other year, pursuant to section 310(a) of the 
    Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to achieve significant savings in 
    mandatory spending.

    appropriation, in whole or in part, for programs not specifically 
    authorized by law or Treaty stipulation, or the amount of which 
    exceeds the amount specifically authorized by law or Treaty 
    stipulation, or that would provide a limited tax benefit as defined

        (2) determine a method for effectively containing the 
    extraordinary growth in unauthorized earmarks.

agencies, including an assessment of programs on an accrual basis, and 
legislation to implement those recommendations, with the express

eliminate Government agencies and programs that are wasteful, 
duplicative, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or have failed to 
accomplish their intended purpose.

SEC. 503. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRICARE.

              UNIVERSITIES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
        (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced by

    consideration will be provided to them through funding of the 
    Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, the 
    Equity in Educational Land Grant Status Act, title III of the 
    Higher Education Act of 1965, and the National Science Foundation, 
    Department of Defense, and Housing and Urban Development Tribal 
    College and University Programs; and
        (2) such equitable consideration reflects the intent of 
    Congress to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding 
    authorization goals for tribal colleges and universities.

SEC. 505. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY RESTRUCTURING.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
        (1) the President, the Congress, and the American people

    should work together at the earliest opportunity to enact 
    legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently sustainable Social 
    Security system;
        (2) Social Security reform must--
            (A) protect current and near retirees from any changes to

            (B) reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on other 
        budgetary priorities;

              HYPERSONIC AERONAUTICS RESEARCH BY THE NATIONAL

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
        (1) the level of funding provided for the Aeronautics Mission 
    Directorate within the National Aeronautics and Space 
    Administration should be increased by $1,582,700,000 between fiscal 
    year 2006 and fiscal year 2010; and
        (2) the increases provided should be applied to the Vehicle 
    Systems portion of the Aeronautics Mission Directorate budget for 
    use in subsonic and hypersonic aeronautical research.

SEC. 507. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ACQUISITION OF THE NEXT 
              GENERATION DESTROYER (DDX).

    (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
        (1) it is ill-advised for the Department of Defense to pursue a 
    winner-take-all strategy for the acquisition of destroyers under 
    the next generation destroyer (DDX) program; and
        (2) the amounts identified in this resolution assume that the 
    Department of Defense will not acquire any destroyer under the next 
    generation destroyer program through a winner-take-all strategy.
    (b) Winner-Take-All Strategy Defined.--In this section, the term 
``winner-take-all strategy'', with respect to the acquisition of 
destroyers under the next generation destroyer program, means the 
acquisition (including design and construction) of such destroyers 
through a single shipyard.
