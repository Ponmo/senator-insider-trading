                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, urging a 
   full and complete investigation to ensure justice is served, and 
      expressing support for all Americans serving nobly in Iraq.

Whereas the United States was founded on the principles of representative 
        government, the rule of law, and the unalienable rights of individuals;
Whereas those principles are the birthright of all individuals and the 
        fulfillment of those principals in Iraq would benefit the people of 
        Iraq, the people of the Middle East, and the people of the United 
        States;
Whereas the vast majority of Americans in Iraq are serving courageously and with 
        great honor to promote a free and stable Iraq and through such service 
        are promoting the values and principles that the people of the United 
        States hold dear;
Whereas Americans serving abroad throughout the history of the United States, 
        both military and civilian, have established a reputation for setting 
        the highest standards of personal, professional, and moral conduct;
Whereas in January 2004, a member of the United States Armed Forces reported 
        alleged abuses perpetrated in Abu Ghraib prison during November and 
        December 2003;
Whereas an inquiry into those alleged abuses was ordered in January 2004, and 
        that inquiry is reported to have found numerous incidents of criminal 
        abuses by a small number of Americans based in Iraq;
Whereas the reaction to the alleged abuses is having a negative impact on the 
        United States efforts to stabilize and reconstruct Iraq and to promote 
        democratic values in the Middle East and could affect the security of 
        the United States Armed Forces serving abroad;
Whereas Congress was not informed about the extent of the alleged abuses until 
        reports about the abuses became public through the media;
Whereas success in the national security policy of the United States demands 
        regular communication between the President, the agencies and 
        departments of the executive branch, Congress, and the people of the 
        United States;
Whereas, in an interview on May 5, 2004, the President stated ``First, people in 
        Iraq must understand that I view those practices as abhorrent. They must 
        also understand that what took place in that prison does not represent 
        America that I know. The America I know is a compassionate country that 
        believes in freedom. The America I know cares about every individual. 
        The America I know has sent troops into Iraq to promote freedom--good, 
        honorable citizens that are helping the Iraqis every day.'';
Whereas in that interview the President further stated ``It's also important for 
        the people of Iraq to know that in a democracy, everything is not 
        perfect, that mistakes are made. But in a democracy, as well, those 
        mistakes will be investigated and people will be brought to justice. 
        We're an open society. We're a society that is willing to investigate, 
        fully investigate in this case, what took place in that prison. That 
        stands in stark contrast to life under Saddam Hussein. His trained 
        torturers were never brought to justice under his regime. There were no 
        investigations about mistreatment of people. There will be 
        investigations. People will be brought to justice.''; and
Whereas the pursuit of truth and justice are core principles of the United 
        States, and if the Government of the United States conducts a full 
        investigation of the alleged abuses and holds accountable the 
        individuals who are responsible for such abuses, the people of Iraq and 
        of the Middle East will witness how a democracy upholds the rule of law 
        and protects the rights of individuals by administering justice in a 
        swift, transparent, and fair manner: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends all Americans serving nobly abroad who are 
        advancing the ideals of freedom and democracy, and working, 
        through the individual and collective actions of such 
        individuals, to improve the lives of all the people of Iraq;
            (2) condemns in the strongest possible terms the despicable 
        acts at Abu Ghraib prison and joins with the President in 
        expressing apology for the humiliation suffered by the 
        prisoners in Iraq and their families;
            (3) urges the Government of the United States to take 
        appropriate measures to ensure that such acts do not occur in 
        the future;
            (4) believes that it is in the interests of the United 
        States and of the people of the United States that the 
        appropriate committees of the Senate, exercising the oversight 
        responsibilities of such committees, and the President, through 
        the appropriate departments or agencies of the executive 
        branch, conduct a full investigation of the abuses alleged to 
        have occurred at Abu Ghraib; and
            (5) urges that all individuals responsible for such 
        despicable acts be held accountable.
