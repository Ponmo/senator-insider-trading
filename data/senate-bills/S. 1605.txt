advanced degaussing system is incorporated into any Arleigh Burke class 
destroyer procured in fiscal year 2025 or any subsequent fiscal year 
pursuant to a covered contract.
    (b) Covered Contract Defined.--In this section, the term ``covered

    (a) <<NOTE: Time period.>>  In General.--Not later than March 1, 
2022, the Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the potential benefits of a multiyear 
contract for the period of fiscal years 2023 through 2027 for the 
procurement of Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers in the 
quantities specified in subsection (c).

    (b) Elements.--The report required by subsection (a) shall include 
preliminary findings, and the basis for such findings, of the Secretary 
with respect to whether--
            (1) the use of a contract described in such subsection could 
        result in significant savings compared to the total anticipated 
        costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts;
            (2) the minimum need for the destroyers described in such 
        subsection to be purchased is expected to remain substantially 
        unchanged during the contemplated contract period in terms of 
        production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;

[[Page 135 STAT. 1571]]

        contemplated contract period the Secretary of Defense will 
        request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid 
        contract cancellation;
            (4) there is a stable design for the destroyers to be 
        acquired and that the technical risks associated with such 
        property are not excessive;
            (5) the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the 
        anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear 
        contract are realistic;
            (6) the use of such a contract will promote the national 
        security of the United States; and
            (7) a decision not to use such a contract will affect the 
        industrial base and, if so, the nature of such effects.

    (c) Evaluation by Quantity.--The report required by subsection (a) 
shall evaluate the potential of procuring each of the following 
quantities of Flight III Arleigh Burke-class destroyers over the period 
described in such subsection:
            (1) 10.
            (2) 12.

            (B) a plan to address any known shortfalls of such carrier 
        wings, including shortfalls with respect to aerial refueling 
        aircraft capacity and strike-fighter combat radius.

        assessment and risk mitigation plan regarding the nine carrier 
        air wings that, as of the date of the plan, support combatant 
        commander steady-state peacetime and potential major contingency 
        requirements.
            (3) An explanation of when the Secretary of the Navy will 
        field a minimum of 10 carrier air wings in accordance with

    (b) Limitation on Certain F-35 Contracts.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Certification. Determination.>>  In general.--
        The Secretary of Defense may not enter into a performance-based 
        logistics sustainment contract for the F-35 airframe or engine 
        programs, or modify an existing contract for the F-35 airframe 
        or engine programs to require the use of a performance-based 
        logistics sustainment contract, unless the Secretary submits to 
        the congressional defense committees a certification that the 
        Secretary has determined such a performance-based logistics 
        contract will--
                    (A) reduce sustainment or operating costs for the F-
                35 airframe or engine programs; or
                    (B) increase readiness rates, full and partial 
                mission capability rates, or airframe and engine 
                availability rates of the F-35 weapon system.
            (2) <<NOTE: Analysis.>>  Certification.--Any certification 
        submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall include a cost-benefit 
        analysis comparing an existing contract for the F-35 airframe or 
        engine programs with a performance-based logistics sustainment 
        contract for the F-35 airframe or engine programs.
            (3) Applicability.--The limitation under paragraph (1) shall 
        not apply with respect to the termination, modification, 
        exercise of a contract option for, or other action relating to, 
        a contract for the F-35 program entered into prior to the date 
        of the enactment of this Act unless such termination, 
        modification, exercise, or other action would require the use of 
        a performance-based logistics sustainment contract as specified 
        in paragraph (1).

    (c) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  Cost-per-tail-per-year Calculation.--
For purposes of this section, the average cost-per-tail of a variant of 
an aircraft of an Armed Force shall be determined by--
            (1) adding the total amount expended for a fiscal year (in 
        base year fiscal 2012 dollars) for all such aircraft in the 
        inventory of an Armed Force for--

        general.--Not later than two years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the President shall prescribe regulations 
        establishing sentencing parameters and sentencing criteria 
        related to offenses under chapter 47 of title 10, United States 
        Code (the Uniform Code of Military Justice), in accordance with 
        this subsection. Such parameters and criteria--
                    (A) shall cover sentences of confinement; and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  may cover lesser 
                punishments, as the President determines appropriate.
            (2) Sentencing parameters.--Sentencing parameters 
        established under paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) identify a delineated sentencing range for an 
                offense that is appropriate for a typical violation of 
                the offense, taking into consideration--
                          (i) the severity of the offense;
                          (ii) the guideline or offense category that 
                      would apply to the offense if the offense were 
                      tried in a United States district court;
                          (iii) any military-specific sentencing 
                      factors;
                          (iv) the need for the sentencing parameter to 
                      be sufficiently broad to allow for individualized 
                      consideration of the offense and the accused; and
                          (v) any other relevant sentencing guideline.
                    (B) include no fewer than 5 and no more than 12 
                offense categories;
                    (C) assign such offense under this chapter to an 
                offense category unless the offense is identified as 
                unsuitable for sentencing parameters under paragraph 
                (4)(F)(ii); and
                    (D) delineate the confinement range for each offense 
                category by setting an upper confinement limit and a 
                lower confinement limit.
            (3) Sentencing criteria.--Sentencing criteria established 
        under paragraph (1) shall identify offense-specific factors the 
        military judge should consider and any collateral effects of 
        available punishments that may aid the military judge in 
        determining an appropriate sentence when there is no applicable 
        sentencing parameter for a specific offense.
            (4) <<NOTE: Designations.>>  Military sentencing parameters 
        and criteria board.--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Establishment.>>  In general.--There is

                                Military Justice) (other than offenses 
                                that the Board identifies as unsuitable 
                                for sentencing parameters in accordance 
                                with clause (ii)); and
                                    (II) sentencing criteria to be used

                                appropriate sentences for offenses that 
                                are identified as unsuitable for 
                                sentencing parameters in accordance with 
                                clause (ii).
                          (ii) Identify each offense under chapter 47 of 
                      title 10, United States Code (the Uniform Code of

                      offense as unsuitable for sentencing parameters 
                      if--
                                    (I) the nature of the offense is 
                                indeterminate and unsuitable for

                                offense under the laws of the United

                                Columbia.
                          (iii) In developing sentencing parameters and 
                      criteria, the Board shall consider the sentencing 
                      data collected by the Military Justice Review 
                      Panel pursuant to section 946(f)(2) of title 10, 
                      United States Code (article 146(f)(2) of the

                          (iv) In addition to establishing parameters 
                      for sentences of confinement under clause (i)(I), 
                      the Board

[[Page 135 STAT. 1706]]

                      shall consider the appropriateness of establishing 
                      sentencing parameters for punitive discharges, 
                      fines, reductions, forfeitures, and other lesser 
                      punishments authorized under chapter 47 of title 
                      10, United States Code (the Uniform Code of

                      effective with respect to the sentencing factors

                      deems appropriate.

        States-Taiwan relations;
            (2) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, the United 
        States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the 
        People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the 
        future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means, and that 
        any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than 
        peaceful means, including boycotts and embargoes, is of grave 
        concern to the United States;
            (3) the increasingly coercive and aggressive behavior of the 
        People's Republic of China towards Taiwan is contrary to the 
        expectation of a peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan;

        policy of the United States to make available to Taiwan such 
        defense articles and defense services in such quantities as may 
        be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
        defense capability should be maintained; and
            (5) the United States should continue to support the 
        development of capable, ready, and modern defense forces 
        necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense 
        capability, including by--
                    (A) supporting acquisition by Taiwan of defense 
                articles and services through foreign military sales, 
                direct commercial sales, and industrial cooperation, 
                with an emphasis on capabilities that support the 
                asymmetric defense strategy of Taiwan;
                    (B) ensuring timely review of and response to 
                requests by Taiwan for defense articles and services;
                    (C) conducting practical training and military 
                exercises with Taiwan, including, as appropriate, 
                inviting Taiwan to participate in the Rim of the Pacific 
                exercise conducted in 2022, that enable Taiwan to 
                maintain a sufficient self-defense capability, as 
                described in the Taiwan Relations Act;
                    (D) deepening interoperability with Taiwan in

             Subtitle A--Matters Relating to Europe and NATO

SEC. 1301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION 
                          ALLIES AND PARTNERS.

    It is the sense of Congress as follows:
            (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) remains 
        the strongest and most successful military alliance in the 
        world, founded on a commitment by its members to uphold the 
        principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of 
        law, and its contributions to the collective defense are 
        indispensable to the security, prosperity, and freedom of its 
        members.
            (2) The success of NATO is critical to achieving United 
        States national security objectives in Europe and around the 
        world, including deterring Russian aggression, upholding 
        territorial integrity and sovereignty in Europe, addressing 
        strategic competition and mitigating shared security concerns, 
        countering malign efforts to undermine the rules-based 
        international order and disrupt shared values, and fostering 
        international cooperation against collective challenges.
            (3) The United States reaffirms its ironclad commitment to 
        NATO as the foundation of transatlantic security and to uphold 
        its obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, including 
        Article 5 of the Treaty, and remains steadfastly committed to 
        upholding and strengthening its defense alliances and 
        partnerships in the European theater.
            (4) The commitment of NATO allies in response to the 
        invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty following 
        attacks on the United States homeland on September 11, 2001, and 
        during years of counterterrorism, humanitarian, and 
        stabilization operations in Afghanistan has been invaluable, and 
        the sacrifices of NATO allies deserve the highest order of 
        respect and gratitude.
            (5) The national security challenges posed by the Russian 
        Government against NATO allies and partners are of grave concern 
        to the United States and a top NATO defense priority. Since the 
        invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the Russian Government has not 
        improved its behavior and has, in many aspects, become 
        increasingly belligerent. Aggression against NATO allies and

[[Page 135 STAT. 1996]]

        United States partners is unacceptable, and Russia's willingness 
        to engage in far-reaching, risky actions contrary to the 
        international order poses major risks to United States national 
        security interests that must be met with sustained engagement, 
        investment in credible deterrence, and vigilance.
            (6) The United States should continue to deepen cooperation 
        on defense issues with non-NATO European partners, bilaterally 
        and as part of the NATO alliance, encourage security sector 
        cooperation between NATO and non-NATO defense partners that 
        complements and strengthens shared security goals, 
        interoperability, and allies' commitment to Article 3 of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty, build on recent progress in NATO allies 
        achieving defense spending goals agreed to at the 2014 Wales 
        Summit and reaffirmed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit and the 2021 
        Brussels Summit, and build consensus to plan, organize, and 
        invest in the full range of defense capabilities necessary to 
        deter and defend against potential adversaries.
            (7) The United States should continue to enhance United 
        States and allied force posture in Europe in order to establish 
        and sustain a credible deterrent against Russian aggression and 
        long-term strategic competition by the Russian Government, 
        including continued robust support for the European Deterrence 
        Initiative and other investments, ongoing use of rotational 
        deployments and robust exercises in the European theater, 
        improved forward-stationing of forces to enhance deterrence and 
        reduce cost, additional planning and efforts to mitigate 
        contested logistics challenges, implementation of key 
        initiatives to enhance readiness, military mobility, and 
        national resilience, and effective investments in multi-service, 
        cyber, information, and air defense efforts to counter modern 
        military challenges.
            (8) Following the end of the Resolute Support Mission in 
        Afghanistan, it is essential that the United States consider 
        ways to continue the benefits of combined interaction alongside 
        NATO allies and United States partners to continue strengthening 
        interoperability and cooperation.
            (9) The Black Sea is a strategically significant region to 
        United States interests and to the security of United States 
        allies and partners, especially in light of Russia's actions in 
        the region and illegal occupation of territory. The United 
        States should continue security cooperation efforts, exercises, 
        and training with regional allies and partners, regional posture 
        enhancements, and support for those allies' and partners' 
        pursuit of their own defenses, as well as joint efforts that 
        enhance interoperability and information sharing.
            (10) Enhancing security and stability in the Western Balkans 
        is a goal that the United States shares with European allies and 
        partners. The United States should continue its efforts to build 
        interoperability and support institutional reforms of the 
        militaries of the Western Balkan nations, including both NATO 
        allies and partners. The United States should also support those 
        nations' efforts to resist disinformation campaigns, predatory 
        investments, efforts to promote instability, and other means by 
        which Russia and China may seek to influence this region of 
        Europe.
            (11) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are model allies and 
        play a critical role in strategic efforts to ensure continued

[[Page 135 STAT. 1997]]

        deterrence against aggression by Russia and maintain the 
        collective security of the NATO alliance. The security of the 
        Baltic region is crucial to the security of the NATO alliance.
            (12) The United States should continue to pursue efforts 
        consistent with the comprehensive, multilateral Baltic Defense 
        Assessment of the military requirements of Estonia, Latvia, and 
        Lithuania issued in December 2020. Robust support to accomplish 
        United States strategic objectives, including by providing 
        assistance to the Baltic countries through security cooperation 
        referred to as the Baltic Security Initiative pursuant to 
        sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United States Code, should be 
        prioritized in the years to come. Specifically, the continuation 
        of--
                    (A) efforts to enhance interoperability among 
                Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and in support of NATO 
                efforts;
                    (B) infrastructure and other host-country support 
                improvements that will enhance United States and allied 
                military mobility across the region;
                    (C) efforts to improve resilience to hybrid threats 
                and cyber defenses in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; 
                and
                    (D) support for planning and budgeting efforts of 
                Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that are regionally 
                synchronized.

SEC. 1322. FOREIGN AREA OFFICER ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Foreign Area Officers of the Army and their equivalent 
        positions in the other Armed Forces (in this section referred to 
        as ``FAOs'') are trained to manage, grow, and enhance security 
        cooperation relationships between the United States and foreign 
        partners and to build the overall military capacity and 
        capabilities of foreign partners.
            (2) At present, some senior defense official positions in 
        United States embassies are filled by officers lacking the 
        necessary skills, training, and experience to strengthen the 
        relationships between the United States and its critical 
        partners and allies.
            (3) FAOs are trained to fill those positions, and 
        deficiencies in the equitable use, assessment, promotion, 
        diversity and inclusion of such officers, as well as limitations 
        on career opportunities, undermine the ability of the Department 
        of Defense to strengthen partnerships and alliances of the 
        United States.
            (4) A federally funded research and development center can 
        provide a roadmap to correcting these deficiencies, 
        strengthening the FAO branch, and placing qualified FAOs in 
        positions of positive influence over United States partnerships 
        and alliances.

    (b) Assessment and Review Required.--

[[Page 135 STAT. 2004]]

            (1) <<NOTE: Deadline. Assessment. Review.>>  In general.--
        Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the Secretary of Defense shall enter into an agreement with 
        a federally funded research and development center to conduct an 
        independent assessment and comprehensive review of the process 
        by which Foreign Area Officers and their equivalent positions in 
        the other Armed Forces (in this section referred to as ``FAOs'') 
        are recruited, selected, trained, assigned, organized, promoted, 
        retained, and used in security cooperation offices, senior 
        defense roles in U.S. embassies, and in other critical roles of 
        engagement with allies and partners.
            (2) <<NOTE: Assessments. Review.>>  Elements.--The 
        assessment and review conducted under paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following:

                    (B) A review of the cultural, racial, and ethnic 
                diversity of FAOs.

                FAOs.
                    (D) A review and assessment of the promotion 
                criteria, process, and possible pathways for career 
                advancement for FAOs.
                    (E) A review of the organization and categorization 
                of FAOs by geographic region.
                    (F) An assessment of the training program for FAOs 
                and its effectiveness.
                    (G) An assessment of the available career paths for 
                FAOs.
                    (H) An assessment of the criteria used to determine 
                staffing requirements for senior defense official 
                positions and security cooperation roles for uniformed 
                officers.

                FAOs in key security cooperation and embassy defense 
                leadership billets would improve the quality and 
                professionalism of the security cooperation workforce 
                under section 384 of title 10, United States Code.
                    (K) A review of how many FAO opportunities are 
                joint-qualifying and an assessment of whether increasing 
                the number of joint-qualified opportunities for FAOs 
                would increase recruitment, retention, and promotion.
                    (L) Any other matters the Secretary determines 
                relevant.

    (c) Results.--The federally funded research and development center

                      using known, available tools and techniques; and
                          (v) targets may be prosecuted with the aid of 
                      automated techniques to achieve speed, mass, and 
                      scale;
                    (C) develop strategies for appropriate utilization 
                of Cyber Mission Teams in support of combatant command

                          WEAPONS AND RELATED SYSTEMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On December 20, 1990, Secretary of Defense Cheney 
        chartered a five-person independent committee known as the 
        Federal Advisory Committee on Nuclear Failsafe and Risk 
        Reduction to assess the capability of the nuclear weapon command 
        and control system to meet the dual requirements of assurance 
        against unauthorized use of nuclear weapons and assurance of 
        timely, reliable execution when authorized, and to identify 
        opportunities for positive measures to enhance failsafe 
        features.
            (2) The Federal Advisory Committee, chaired by Ambassador 
        Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, recommended changes in the

[[Page 135 STAT. 2094]]

        nuclear enterprise, as well as policy proposals to reduce the 
        risks posed by unauthorized launches and miscalculation.
            (3) The Federal Advisory Committee found, unambiguously, 
        that ``failsafe and oversight enhancements are possible''.
            (4) Since 1990, new threats to the nuclear enterprise have 
        arisen in the cyber, space, and information warfare domains.
            (5) Ensuring the continued assurance of the nuclear command, 
        control, and communications infrastructure is essential to the 
        national security of the United States.

    (b) Review.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide for the conduct 
of an independent review of the safety, security, and reliability of 
covered nuclear systems. The Secretary shall ensure that such review is 
conducted in a manner similar to the review conducted by the Federal 
Advisory Committee on Nuclear Failsafe and Risk Reduction.
    (c) <<NOTE: Recommenda- tions.>>  Matters Included.--The review 
conducted pursuant to subsection (b) shall include the following:
            (1) Plans for modernizing the covered nuclear systems, 
        including options and recommendations for technical, procedural, 
        and policy measures that could strengthen safeguards, improve 
        the security and reliability of digital technologies, and 
        prevent cyber-related and other risks that could lead to the 
        unauthorized or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons as the result 
        of an accident, misinterpretation, miscalculation, terrorism, 
        unexpected technological breakthrough, or deliberate act.
            (2) Options and recommendations for nuclear risk reduction 
        measures, focusing on confidence building and predictability, 
        that the United States could carry out alone or with near-peer 
        adversaries to strengthen safeguards against the unauthorized or 
        inadvertent use of a nuclear weapon and to reduce nuclear risks.

    (d) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Submission.--Not later than one year after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees the review conducted pursuant to 
subsection (b).

    (e) <<NOTE: Reports.>>  Previous Review.--Not later than 30 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit 
to the congressional defense committees the final report of the Federal 
Advisory Committee on Nuclear Failsafe and Risk Reduction.

    (f) Covered Nuclear Systems Defined.--In this section, the term 
``covered nuclear systems'' means the following systems of the United 
States:
            (1) The nuclear weapons systems.
            (2) The nuclear command, control, and communications system.

SEC. 5101. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE OF DEPARTMENT OF 
                          STATE'S WORK.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) United States global engagement is key to a stable and 
        prosperous world;
            (2) United States leadership is indispensable in light of 
        the many complex and interconnected threats facing the United 
        States and the world;
            (3) diplomacy and development are critical tools of national 
        power, and full deployment of these tools is vital to United 
        States national security;
            (4) challenges such as the global refugee and migration 
        crises, terrorism, historic famine and food insecurity, and 
        fragile or repressive societies cannot be addressed without 
        sustained and robust United States diplomatic and development 
        leadership;
            (5) the United States Government must use all of the 
        instruments of national security and foreign policy at its 
        disposal to protect United States citizens, promote United 
        States interests and values, and support global stability and 
        prosperity;
            (6) United States security and prosperity depend on having 
        partners and allies that share our interests and values, and 
        these partnerships are nurtured and our shared interests and 
        values are promoted through United States diplomatic engagement, 
        security cooperation, economic statecraft, and assistance that 
        helps further economic development, good governance, including 
        the rule of law and democratic institutions, and the development 
        of shared responses to natural and humanitarian disasters;
            (7) as the United States Government agencies primarily 
        charged with conducting diplomacy and development, the 
        Department and the United States Agency for International 
        Development (USAID) require sustained and robust funding to 
        carry out this important work, which is essential to our ability 
        to project United States leadership and values and to advance 
        United States interests around the world;
            (8) the work of the Department and USAID makes the United 
        States and the world safer and more prosperous by alleviating 
        global poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and other 
        infectious diseases, strengthening alliances, expanding 
        educational opportunities for women and girls, promoting good 
        governance and democracy, supporting anti-corruption efforts, 
        driving economic development and trade, preventing armed 
        conflicts and humanitarian crises, and creating American jobs 
        and export opportunities;
            (9) the Department and USAID are vital national security 
        agencies, whose work is critical to the projection of United 
        States power and leadership worldwide, and without which 
        Americans would be less safe, United States economic power would 
        be diminished, and global stability and prosperity would suffer;

[[Page 135 STAT. 2343]]

            (10) investing in diplomacy and development before conflicts 
        break out saves American lives while also being cost-effective; 
        and
            (11) the contributions of personnel working at the 
        Department and USAID are extraordinarily valuable and allow the 
        United States to maintain its leadership around the world.

United States in the Information Sharing Centre located in Singapore, as

SEC. 5108. IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TRAINING TO NATIONAL 
                          SECURITY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department is a crucial national security agency, 
        whose employees, both Foreign and Civil Service, require the 
        best possible training at every stage of their careers to 
        prepare them to promote and defend United States national 
        interests and the health and safety of United States citizens 
        abroad;
            (2) the Department's investment of time and resources with 
        respect to the training and education of its personnel

[[Page 135 STAT. 2348]]

        is considerably below the level of other Federal departments and 
        agencies in the national security field, and falls well below 
        the investments many allied and adversarial countries make in 
        the development of their diplomats;
            (3) the Department faces increasingly complex and rapidly 
        evolving challenges, many of which are science and technology-
        driven, and which demand the continual, high-quality training 
        and education of its personnel;
            (4) the Department must move beyond reliance on ``on-the-job 
        training'' and other informal mentorship practices, which lead 
        to an inequality in skillset development and career advancement 
        opportunities, often particularly for minority personnel, and 
        towards a robust professional tradecraft training continuum that 
        will provide for greater equality in career advancement and 
        increase minority participation in the senior ranks;
            (5) the Department's Foreign Service Institute and other 
        training facilities should seek to substantially increase their 
        educational and training offerings to Department personnel, 
        including developing new and innovative educational and training 
        courses, methods, programs, and opportunities; and
            (6) consistent with existing Department gift acceptance 
        authority and other applicable laws, the Department and Foreign 
        Service Institute may accept funds and other resources from 
        foundations, not-for-profit corporations, and other appropriate 
        sources to help the Department and the Institute enhance the 
        quantity and quality of training offerings, especially in the 
        introduction of new, innovative, and pilot model courses.

    (b) <<NOTE: Deadline. Strategy.>>  Training Float.--Not later than 
90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
State shall develop and submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a strategy to establish a ``training float'' to allow for up 
to 15 percent of the Civil and Foreign Service to participate in long-
term training at any given time. The strategy should identify steps 
necessary to ensure the implementation of the training priorities 
identified in subsection (c), sufficient training capacity and 
opportunities are available to Civil and Foreign Service officers, the 
equitable distribution of long-term training opportunities to Civil and 
Foreign Service officers, and the provision of any additional resources 
or authorities necessary to facilitate such a training float, including 
programs at the George P. Schultz National Foreign Affairs Training 
Center, the Foreign Service Institute, the Foreign Affairs Security 
Training Center, and other facilities or programs operated by the 
Department of State. The strategy shall identify which types of training 
would be prioritized, the extent (if any) to which such training is 
already being provided to Civil and Foreign Service officers by the 
Department of State, any factors incentivizing or disincentivizing such 
training, and why such training cannot be achieved without Civil and 
Foreign Service officers leaving the workforce. In addition to training 
opportunities provided by the Department, the strategy shall consider 
training that could be provided by the other United States Government 
training institutions, as well as nongovernmental educational 
institutions. The strategy shall consider approaches to overcome 
disincentives to pursuing long-term training.

[[Page 135 STAT. 2349]]

    (c) Prioritization.--In order to provide the Civil and Foreign 
Service with the level of education and training needed to effectively 
advance United States interests across the globe, the Department of 
State should--
            (1) increase its offerings--
                    (A) of virtual instruction to make training more 
                accessible to personnel deployed throughout the world; 
                or
                    (B) at partner organizations to provide useful 
                outside perspectives to Department personnel;
            (2) offer courses utilizing computer-based or assisted 
        simulations, allowing civilian officers to lead decisionmaking 
        in a crisis environment; and
            (3) consider increasing the duration and expanding the focus 
        of certain training courses, including--
                    (A) the A-100 orientation course for Foreign Service 
                officers, and
                    (B) the chief of mission course to more accurately 
                reflect the significant responsibilities accompanying 
                such role.

    (d) Other Agency Responsibilities.--Other national security agencies 
should increase the enrollment of their personnel in courses at the 
Foreign Service Institute and other Department of State training 
facilities to promote a whole-of-government approach to mitigating 
national security challenges.

    For ``Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance'', there is 
authorized to be appropriated $1,983,149,000 for fiscal year 2022.
SEC. 5202. STANDARD DESIGN IN CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department's Bureau of Overseas Building Operations (OBO) or successor 
office should give appropriate consideration to standardization in 
construction, in which each new United States embassy and consulate 
starts with a standard design and keeps customization to a minimum.
    (b) Consultation.--The Secretary shall carry out any new United 
States embassy compound or new consulate compound project that utilizes 
a non-standard design, including those projects that are in the design 
or pre-design phase as of the date of the enactment of this Act, only in 
consultation with the appropriate congressional committees and the 
Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives. The Secretary shall provide the appropriate 
congressional committees and the Committees on Appropriations of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives, for each such project, the 
following documentation:
            (1) <<NOTE: Cost estimate.>>  A comparison of the estimated 
        full lifecycle costs of the project to the estimated full 
        lifecycle costs of such project if it were to use a standard 
        design.
            (2) <<NOTE: Estimate.>>  A comparison of the estimated 
        completion date of such project to the estimated completion date 
        of such project if it were to use a standard design.
            (3) A comparison of the security of the completed project to 
        the security of such completed project if it were to use a 
        standard design.
            (4) A justification for the Secretary's selection of a non-
        standard design over a standard design for such project.
            (5) A written explanation if any of the documentation 
        necessary to support the comparisons and justification, as the 
        case may be, described in paragraphs (1) through (4) cannot be 
        provided.

    (c) Sunset.--The consultation requirement under subsection (b) shall 
expire on the date that is 4 years after the date of the enactment of 
this Act.
SEC. 5203. CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION TRANSPARENCY.

        shall submit to the

[[Page 135 STAT. 2360]]

        appropriate congressional committees a report detailing an 
        empirical analysis on the effect of overseas allowances on the 
        foreign assignment of Foreign Service officers (FSOs), to be 
        conducted by a federally-funded research and development center 
        with appropriate expertise in labor economics and military 
        compensation.
            (2) Contents.--The analysis required under paragraph (1) 
        shall--
                    (A) identify all allowances paid to FSOs assigned 
                permanently or on temporary duty to foreign areas;
                    (B) <<NOTE: Examination. Determination.>>  examine 
                the efficiency of the Foreign Service bidding system in 
                determining foreign assignments;
                    (C) <<NOTE: Examination.>>  examine the factors that 
                incentivize FSOs to bid on particular assignments, 
                including danger levels and hardship conditions;
                    (D) <<NOTE: Examination.>>  examine the Department's 
                strategy and process for incentivizing FSOs to bid on 
                assignments that are historically in lower demand, 
                including with monetary compensation, and whether 
                monetary compensation is necessary for assignments in 
                higher demand;
                    (E) make any relevant comparisons to military 
                compensation and allowances, noting which allowances are 
                shared or based on the same regulations;
                    (F) <<NOTE: Recommenda- tions.>>  recommend options 
                for restructuring allowances to improve the efficiency 
                of the assignments system and better align FSO 
                incentives with the needs of the Foreign Service, 
                including any cost savings associated with such 
                restructuring;
                    (G) <<NOTE: Recommenda- tions.>>  recommend any 
                statutory changes necessary to implement subparagraph 
                (F), such as consolidating existing legal authorities 
                for the provision of hardship and danger pay; and
                    (H) <<NOTE: Consultation.>>  detail any effects of 
                recommendations made pursuant to subparagraphs (F) and 
                (G) on other United States Government departments and 
                agencies with civilian employees permanently assigned or 
                on temporary duty in foreign areas, following 
                consultation with such departments and agencies.

        center to conduct such analysis in a quantitative and analytical 
        manner, including historical data on the number of bids for each

        Department from eligible bidders on their bid decision-making.

[[Page 135 STAT. 2361]]

            (2) Cooperation.--The Secretary shall work with the heads of 
        other relevant United States Government departments and agencies

SEC. 5306. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CERTAIN FELLOWSHIP 
                          PROGRAMS.

    It is the sense of Congress that Department fellowships that promote 
the employment of candidates belonging to under-represented groups, 
including the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Graduate 
Fellowship Program, the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship 
Program, and the Donald M. Payne International Development Fellowship 
Program, represent smart investments vital for building a strong, 
capable, and representative national security workforce.

SEC. 5309. WORKFORCE ACTIONS.

    (a) Sense of Congress on Workforce Recruitment.--It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary should continue to hold entry-level classes 
for Foreign Service officers and specialists and continue to recruit 
civil servants through programs such as the Presidential Management 
Fellows Program and Pathways Internship Programs in a manner and at a 
frequency consistent with prior years and consistent with the need to 
maintain a pool of experienced personnel effectively distributed across 
skill codes and ranks. It is further the sense of Congress that absent

[[Page 135 STAT. 2363]]

recruitment and training of Foreign Service officers and civil servants, 
the Department will lack experienced, qualified personnel in the short, 
medium, and long terms.
    (b) Limitation.--The Secretary should not implement any reduction-
in-force action under section 3502 or 3595 of title 5, United States

                    (B) a certification that such workforce reduction is 
                in the national interest of the United States;
                    (C) a comprehensive strategic staffing plan for the 
                Department, including 5-year workforce forecasting and a

                workforce reduction; and
                    (D) a dataset displaying comprehensive workforce 
                data for all current and planned employees of the 
                Department, disaggregated by--
                          (i) Foreign Service officer and Foreign 
                      Service specialist rank;
                          (ii) civil service job skill code, grade 
                      level, and bureau of assignment;

                      subpart C of part 213 of title 5, Code of Federal 
                      Regulations, including their equivalent grade and 
                      job skill code and bureau of assignment.
SEC. 5310. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING VETERANS EMPLOYMENT AT THE 
                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department should continue to promote the employment 
        of veterans, in accordance with section 301 of the Foreign 
        Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3941), as amended by section

        significant contributions to United States foreign policy in a 
        variety of regional and global affairs bureaus and diplomatic 
        posts overseas; and
            (3) the Department should continue to encourage veteran 
        employment and facilitate their participation in the workforce.
SEC. 5311. EMPLOYEE ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTIONS AND PRECLUSIONS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department should expand the appeal process it makes available to 
employees related to assignment preclusions and restrictions.

[[Page 135 STAT. 2364]]

    (b) Appeal of Assignment Restriction or Preclusion.--Subsection (a) 
of section 414 of the Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 
2017 (22 U.S.C. 2734c(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following 
new sentences: ``Such right and process shall ensure that any employee 
subjected to an assignment restriction or preclusion shall have the same 
appeal rights as provided by the Department regarding denial or 
revocation of a security clearance. Any <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  such appeal 
shall be resolved not later than 60 days after such appeal is filed.''.

    (c) <<NOTE: Deadline. Applicability. 22 USC 2734c note.>>  Notice 
and Certification.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the

impose an assignment restriction or preclusion to an employee.

of the Senate a report that contains the following:
            (1) A rationale for the use of assignment restrictions by 
        the Department of State, including specific case studies related 
        to cleared United States Foreign Service and civil service 
        employees of the Department that demonstrate country-specific 
        restrictions serve a counterintelligence role beyond that which 
        is already covered by the security clearance process.
            (2) The number of such Department employees subject to 
        assignment restrictions over the previous year, with data 
        disaggregated by--
                    (A) identification as a Foreign Service officer, 
                civil service employee, eligible family member, or other 
                employment status;
                    (B) the ethnicity, national origin, and race of the 
                precluded employee;
                    (C) gender; and

        the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to determine whether an 
        assignment restriction is warranted.

        success rate of such appeals.
            (5) The impact of assignment restrictions in terms of unused 
        language skills as measured by Foreign Service Institute 
        language scores of such precluded employees.
            (6) Measures taken to ensure the diversity of adjudicators 
        and contracted investigators, with accompanying data on results.
SEC. 5312. RECALL AND REEMPLOYMENT OF CAREER MEMBERS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) career Department employees provide invaluable service

        subject matter expertise and professional skills to the

[[Page 135 STAT. 2365]]

        successful development and execution of United States foreign 
        policy; and
            (2) reemployment of skilled former members of the Foreign 
        and civil service who have voluntarily separated from the 
        Foreign or civil service due to family reasons or to obtain 
        professional skills outside government is of benefit to the 
        Department.

    (b) Notice of Employment Opportunities.--Title 5, United States 
Code, is amended by inserting after chapter 102 the following new 
chapter:
