  with this section.
  `(a) ELIGIBILITY- Projects eligible under the Surface Transportation
  program shall include--
  `(1) construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, restoration,
  mitigation of damage to wildlife, habitat, and ecosystems caused by a
  transportation project funded under this title, and operational improvements
  for highways (including Interstate highways) and bridges  (including bridges
  on public roads of all functional classifications), including any such
  construction or reconstruction necessary to accommodate  other transportation
  modes, and including the seismic retrofit, painting of and application of
  calcium magnesium acetate on bridges and other elevated structures;
  `(2) capital costs for mass transit, passenger rail (including high speed
  rail), and operating cost for passenger rail for States without Amtrak
  service as of the date of enactment of this Act, publicly owned intra- or
  inter-city bus terminals and facilities, and magnetic levitation systems,
  including expenditures on rights of way and associated facilities, and
  expenses for contracted passenger rail or magnetic levitation service
  provided by public or private carriers;
  `(3) carpool projects and fringe and corridor parking facilities and
  programs, and bicycle facilities and programs;

  Air Act, as amended;
  `(10) incremental costs attributable to the use of alternative fuels by
  school buses, including purchase and installation of alternative fuel
  refueling facilities to be used primarily for school bus refueling
  and conversion of school buses to make them capable of using only an
  alternative fuel (except that diesel school buses may be converted to run
  on a combination of diesel and natural gas): Provided, That any conversion
  using funds authorized by this paragraph comply with the warranty and
  safety requirements for alternative fuel conversions contained in section
  247 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990: Provided further, That for
  purposes of this paragraph, `alternative fuels' means methanol, ethanol,
  and other alcohols; mixtures containing 85 percent or more by volume of
  methanol, ethanol, or other alcohol with gasoline or other fuels; natural
  gas; liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; and
  electricity; and

under Federal law, including but not limited to the National Environmental
Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act. These efforts may include the development of statewide wetland
conservation plans, and other State or regional efforts to conserve and
restore wetlands. Contributions toward these efforts may occur in advance of
specific highway construction activity only if the State has a transportation
planning process that precludes the use of such efforts to influence the
environmental assessment of the highway construction project, the decision
relative to the need to construct the highway project, or the selection of
the project design or location.
  `(b) General Requirements-
  `(1)(A) At least 75 per centum of apportionments and obligation authority

  shall have submitted to the Secretary a certification that the asphalt
  pavement laid in the State in such year and financed in whole or part by
  such grants shall satisfy the minimum utilization requirement for asphalt
  rubber pavement established by this section. The Secretary may modify
  the minimum utilization requirement for asphalt rubber pavement during a
  phase-in period, if the Secretary determines that such phase-in period is
  necessary to develop production and application facilities for asphalt
  rubber pavement. Such phase-in period shall not extend beyond the date
  six years after the date of enactment of this section. The Secretary may
  increase the minimum utilization requirement for asphalt rubber pavement
  to be used in federally-assisted highway projects to the extent it is
  technologically and economically feasible to do so and if an increase is
  appropriate to assure markets for the reuse and recycling of scrap tires.
  (b) The Secretary may set aside the provisions of this section for
  any three-year period on a determination, made in concurrence with the
  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to
  paragraphs (1) and (2), that there is reliable evidence indicating--

  substantially increases risks to human health or the environment as compared
  to the risks associated with conventional pavement;
  (2) that asphalt rubber pavement cannot be recycled to the same degree as
  conventional pavement; or
  (3) that asphalt rubber pavement does not perform adequately as a material
  for the construction or surfacing of highways and roads.
  (c) Any determination made to set aside the requirements of this section
  may be renewed for an additional three-year period by the Secretary, with
  the concurrence of the Administrator with respect to determinations made
  under subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). Any determination made with respect to
  subsection (b)(3) may be made for specific States or regions considering
  climate, geography and other factors that may be unique to the State or
  region and that would prevent the adequate performance of asphalt rubber
  pavement in such State or region.
  (d) The minimum utilization requirement for asphalt rubber pavement in
  federally-assisted highway projects shall be not less than an average
  of six pounds of rubber derived from scrap tires for each one ton of
  finished asphalt pavement used in federally-assisted highway projects in the
  State. The Secretary may grant a State credit toward the minimum utilization
  requirement for volumes of asphalt rubber pavement used in other road and
  construction projects and for asphalt rubber pavement containing rubber
  at rates less than or greater than six pounds per ton: Provided, That the
  total amount of rubber used in asphalt pavement containing rubber in the
  State in any year is at least equivalent to the amount that would be used if
  100 per centum of the pavement used in federally-assisted highway projects
  in the State contained six pounds of rubber per ton of finished pavement.
  (e) The Secretary shall establish a minimum utilization requirement
  for asphalt rubber pavement less than the minimum otherwise required by
  subsection (d) in a particular State, upon the request of such State and
  with the concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
  Agency, if the Secretary determines that there is not a sufficient quantity
  of scrap tires available prior to disposal in the State to meet the minimum
  utilization requirement established by subsection (d) and each of the other
  recycling and processing uses, including retreading, for which scrap tires
  are required.
  (f) For purposes of this section--
  (1) the term `process' means the utilization of tires to reclaim material
  or energy value;
  (2) the term `recycle' means to process scrap tires to produce usable
  materials other than fuels;
  (3) the term `asphalt rubber pavement' means any hot mix asphalt paving
  mixture which contains rubber derived from scrap tires, is produced using
  the wet or dry process and is used for a pavement base, surface course,
  or stress absorbing membrane interlayer;
  (4) the term `stress absorbing membrane interlayer' means a process of spray
  applying asphalt rubber pavement prior to the overlayment of conventional
  asphalt pavement to reduce reflective cracking and to waterproof the roadway.
  (g) The Secretary shall, in cooperation with the Administrator of the
  Environmental Protection Agency, conduct a program of research to determine--
  (1) the public health and environmental risks associated with the production
  and use of asphalt rubber pavement;
  (2) the performance of the asphalt rubber pavement under various climate
  and use conditions; and
  (3) the degree to which asphalt rubber pavement can be recycled.
The research program required by this subsection shall be completed not later
than three years after the date of enactment of this Act. The Secretary is
authorized to use funds pursuant to sections 103(b) and 115 (making amendments
to section 307 of title 23, United States Code) to carry out the research
required by this subsection.

PART C--TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYEE TESTING
SEC. 261. SHORT TITLE.
  This part may be cited as the `Omnibus  Transportation Employee Testing
  Act of 1991'.
SEC. 262. FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) alcohol abuse and illegal drug use pose significant dangers to the
  safety and welfare of the Nation;
  (2) millions of the Nation's citizens utilize transportation by aircraft,
  railroads, trucks, and buses, and depend on the operators of aircraft,
  trains, trucks, and buses to perform in a safe and responsible manner;
  (3) the greatest efforts must be expended to eliminate the abuse of alcohol
  and use of illegal drugs, whether on duty or off duty, by those individuals
  who are involved in the operation of aircraft, trains, trucks, and buses;
  (4) the use of alcohol and illegal drugs has been demonstrated to affect
  significantly the performance of individuals, and has been proven to have
  been a critical factor in transportation accidents;
  (5) the testing of uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces has shown that
  the most effective deterrent to abuse of alcohol and use of illegal drugs
  is increased testing, including random testing;
  (6) adequate safeguards can be implemented to ensure that testing for
  abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs is performed in a manner which
  protects an individual's right of privacy, ensures that no individual is
  harassed by being treated differently from other individuals, and ensures
  that no individual's reputation or career development is unduly threatened
  or harmed; and
  (7) rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing program for
  abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs, and should be made available to
  individuals, as appropriate.

  collection of specimen samples;
  (2) with respect to laboratories and testing procedures for controlled
  substances, incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services
  scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11, 1988, and any subsequent
  amendments thereto, including mandatory guidelines which--
  (A) establish comprehensive standards for all aspects of laboratory
  controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in
  carrying out this section, including standards which require the use of the
  best available technology for ensuring the full reliability and accuracy
  of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain
  of custody of specimen samples collected for controlled substances testing;

  Federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance by any individual
  shall be confirmed by a scientifically recognized method of testing capable
  of providing quantitative data regarding alcohol or a controlled substance;
  (5) provide that each specimen sample be subdivided, secured, and labelled
  in the presence of the tested individual and that a portion thereof be
  retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so
  that in the event the individual's confirmation test results are positive
  the individual has an opportunity to have the retained portion assayed by
  a confirmation test done independently at a second certified laboratory
  if the individual requests the independent test within three days after
  being advised of the results of the confirmation test;
  (6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol
  in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the
  development of regulations as may be necessary and in consultation with
  the Department of Health and Human Services;
  (7) provide for the confidentiality of test results and medical information
  (other than information relating to alcohol or a controlled substance) of
  employees, except that the provisions of this paragraph shall not preclude
  the use of test results for the orderly imposition of appropriate sanctions
  under this section; and
  (8) ensure that employees are selected for tests by nondiscriminatory
  and impartial methods, so that no employee is harassed by being treated
  differently from other employees in similar circumstances.
  (e) EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS-
  (1) STATE AND LOCAL LAW AND REGULATIONS- No State or local government shall
  adopt or have in effect any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, standard,
  or order that is inconsistent with the regulations issued under this
  section, except that the regulations issued under this section shall not
  be construed to preempt provisions of State criminal law which impose
  sanctions for reckless conduct leading to actual loss of life, injury,
  or damage to property, whether the provisions apply specifically to mass
  transportation employees, or to the general public.
  (2) OTHER REGULATION ISSUED BY SECRETARY- Nothing in this section shall
  be construed to restrict the discretion of the Secretary to continue in
  force, amend, or further supplement any regulations governing the use of
  alcohol or controlled substances by mass transportation employees issued
  before the date of enactment of this Act.
  (3) INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS- In issuing regulations under this section,

  (B) disqualification for an established period of time or dismissal of any
  such employee determined to have used a controlled substance, whether on
  duty or not on duty, except as permitted for medical purposes by law or
  any regulations.
  (2) EFFECT ON OTHER APPLICABLE PENALTIES- Nothing in this section shall
  be construed to supersede any penalty applicable to a mass transportation
  employee under any other provision of law.

  for Federal financial assistance under section 3, 9, or 18 of the Urban
  Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (49 App. U.S.C. 1602, 1607a, or 1614)
  or section 103(e)(4) of title 23, United States Code, if such person--
  (1) is required, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary under
  this section, to establish a program of alcohol and controlled substances
  testing; and

  (2) this Federal policy is inconsistent with important national policy
  objectives, including the need to conserve energy, reduce reliance on
  energy imports, lessen congestion, and clean our Nation's air;
  (3) commuter transit benefits should be part of a comprehensive solution
  to national transportation and air pollution problems;
  (4) current Federal law allows employers to provide only up to $15 per
  month in employee benefits for transit or van pools;
  (5) the current `cliff provision', which treats an entire commuter transit
  benefit as taxable income if it exceeds $15 per month, unduly penalizes
  the most effective employer efforts to change commuter behavior;
  (6) employer-provided commuter transit incentives offer many public benefits,
  including increased access of low-income persons to good jobs, inexpensive
  reduction of roadway and parking congestion, and cost-effective incentives
  for timely arrival at work; and
  (7) legislation to provide equitable treatment of employer-provided commuter
  transit benefits has been introduced with bipartisan support in both the
  Senate and House of Representatives.
  (b) POLICY- The Congress strongly supports Federal policy that promotes
  increased use of employer-provided commuter transit benefits. Such a policy
  `levels the playing field' between transportation modes and is consistent
  with important national objectives of energy conservation, reduced reliance
  on energy imports, lessened congestion, and clean air.

  `(ii) establish the maximum amounts of Federal financial assistance for
  such project; and
  `(iii) facilitate timely and efficient management of such project in
  accordance with Federal law.
  `(C) A contract under subparagraph (B) shall obligate an amount of
  available budget authority specified in law and may include a commitment,
  contingent upon the future availability of budget authority, to obligate
  an additional amount or additional amounts from future available budget
  authority specified in law. The contract shall specify that the contingent
  commitment does not constitute an obligation of the United States. The
  future availability of budget authority referred to in the first sentence
  of this subparagraph shall be amounts specified in law in advance for
  commitments entered into under subparagraph (B). Any interest and other
  financing costs of efficiently carrying out the project or a portion
  thereof shall be considered as a cost of carrying out the project under
  a full funding contract, except that eligible costs shall not be greater
  than the costs of the most favorable financing terms reasonably available
  for the project at the time of borrowing. The total of amounts stipulated
  in a contract for a fixed guideway project shall be sufficient to complete
  not less than an operable segment.
  `(D) The Secretary is authorized to enter into early systems work agreements
  with the applicant if a record of decision pursuant to the National

  on the project and the Secretary determines there is reason to believe--
  `(i) a full funding contract will be entered into for the project; and
  `(ii) the terms of the early systems work agreement will promote ultimate
  completion of the project more rapidly and at less cost.
The early systems work agreement shall obligate an amount of available
budget authority specified in law and shall provide for reimbursement of
preliminary costs of project implementation, including land acquisition, timely
procurement of system elements for which specifications are determined, and
other activities that the Secretary determines to be appropriate to facilitate
efficient, long-term project management. The interest and other financing
costs of carrying out the early systems work agreement efficiently shall be
considered as a cost of carrying out the agreement, except that eligible
costs shall not be greater than the costs of the most favorable financing
terms reasonably available for the project at the time of borrowing. If an
applicant fails to implement the project for reasons within the applicant's
control, the applicant shall repay all Federal payments made under the early
systems work agreement plus such reasonable interest and penalty charges as
the Secretary may establish in the agreement.';
  (4) by inserting `(E)' before `The total estimated';
  (5) in the sentence that begins `The total estimated'--
  (A) by inserting `and contingent commitments to incur obligations,' after
  `Federal obligations';
  (B) by inserting `early systems work agreements and full funding grant
  contracts,' after `all outstanding letters of intent,'; and
  (C) by inserting `or 50 percent of the uncommitted cash balance remaining
  in the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund, including amounts
  received from taxes and interest earned in excess of amounts that have
  been previously obligated, whichever is greater' after `section 3 of this
  Act'; and
  (6) in the sentence that begins `The total amount covered', by inserting
  `and contingent commitments included in early systems work agreements and
  full funding grant contracts' after `by new letters issued,'.

SEC. 309. SECTION 3 PROGRAM--RAIL MODERNIZATION FORMULA.
  Section 3(k) of the Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1602(k)) is amended by adding at
  the end the following:
  `(3) RAIL MODERNIZATION FORMULA-
  `(A) HOLD HARMLESS FOR HISTORIC RAIL SYSTEMS-
  `(i) IN GENERAL- Of the amounts available under paragraph (1)(A), the
  Secretary shall, in each of fiscal years 1992 through 1996, reserve for
  grants to historic rail systems $455,000,000 or the amount approved in an
  appropriations Act, whichever is less.
  `(ii) SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS- The Secretary shall initially allocate--
  `(I) 41 percent of the amount reserved in clause (i) to those two historic
  rail systems with shared responsibility for the operation and preservation
  of a regional commuter rail line that, taken together, would receive 49
  percent under the apportionment formula specified in section 9(b)(2) if
  such formula was applied, solely for the historic rail systems, to the
  total amount available for allocation under this paragraph, with 14.63
  percent of the amounts so allocated being reserved for the smaller of the
  two historic rail systems as measured by fixed guideway route miles; and
  `(II) an amount equal to 2 percent of the amount reserved in clause (i)
  to that historic rail system that received funding for rail modernization
  under this section for only 2 of the 5 fiscal years 1986 through 1990.
  `(iii) GENERAL ALLOCATIONS- The Secretary shall allocate all amounts
  described in clause (i) that remain after making the allocations specified
  in clause (ii) so that each historic rail system, other than those specified
  under such clause, receives the higher of--
  `(I) an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount available
  for allocation under this subparagraph as the total amount of funding for
  rail modernization activities received during fiscal years 1984 through
  1990 by that historic system bears to the total amount of funding for
  rail modernization received during fiscal years 1984 through 1990 by all
  historic rail systems, or
  `(II) an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount available
  for allocation under this subparagraph as the total amount of funding for
  rail modernization activities received during fiscal years 1988 through
  1990 by that historic system bears to the total amount of funding for
  rail modernization received during fiscal years 1988 through 1990 by all
  historic rail systems.
The Secretary shall make such fair and equitable adjustments to the amounts
received by historic rail systems under this clause as are necessary for the
practicable administration of the program. Notwithstanding the allocations
that would otherwise result under this clause, an historic rail system shall
not receive less than the amount the system would receive if the apportionment
formula specified under section 9(b)(2) were applied, solely for the historic
rail systems, to the total amount available for allocation under this clause.
  `(B) REMAINDER-
  `(i) INITIAL ALLOCATION- After reserving amounts for historic rail systems
  as required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall allocate any amounts
  remaining available under paragraph (1)(A) that exceed the allocations
  made under subparagraph (A), but that do not exceed $525,000,000, as follows:
  `(I) 50 percent shall be allocated among historic rail systems in accordance
  with the apportionment formula specified under section 9(b)(2); and
  `(II) 50 percent shall be allocated among all other eligible systems in
  accordance with the apportionment formula specified under section 9(b)(2).
  `(ii) SECOND ALLOCATION- Any amounts available under paragraph (1)(A)
  in excess of the amounts allocated under subparagraph (A) and clause (i)
  of this subparagraph shall be made available to all eligible systems in
  accordance with the apportionment formula specified under section 9(b)(2).
  `(C) APPORTIONMENT- (i) On October 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretary
  shall apportion any amounts made available or authorized to be appropriated
  for that fiscal year (and any fiscal years remaining in the authorization
  period identified under paragraph (3)) among all eligible systems in
  accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. The Secretary shall
  publish apportionments of such authorized amounts on the apportionment
  date established by the preceding sentence.
  `(ii) The Secretary shall apportion any amounts provided or approved for
  obligation in an appropriations Act to carry out paragraph (3)(A) for any
  fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph not later
  than the 10th day following the date on which such funds were appropriated
  or October 1 of such fiscal year, whichever is later. The Secretary shall
  publish apportionments of such appropriated amounts on the apportionment
  date established by the preceding sentence.
  `(D) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this paragraph--
  `(i) the term `historic rail system' includes those rail systems that (I)
  received funding for rail modernization under this section for at least 2
  of the 5 fiscal years 1986 through 1990, and (II) receive in fiscal year
  1991 at least 0.5 percent of the total amount of funding made available
  under section 9(b)(2); and
  `(ii) the term `eligible systems' shall include, for a given fiscal year,
  all historic rail systems and all other fixed guideway systems placed in
  revenue service more than 10 years prior to such fiscal year. The term
  `eligible system' may include, for a given fiscal year, a fixed guideway
  system not eligible under the preceding sentence if such system, prior
  to the beginning of such fiscal year, demonstrates to the satisfaction
  of the Secretary that the system has modernization needs that cannot be
  met adequately with amounts received under section 9(b)(2) of this Act. A
  fixed guideway system shall be considered to be placed in revenue service
  for purposes of this clause if a minimum operable segment of such system
  was so placed.'.
SEC. 310. SECTION 3 PROGRAM--LOCAL SHARE.
  Section 4(a) of the Act is amended by inserting at the end the following new
  sentence: `The remainder so provided may include the cost of rolling stock
  previously purchased if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of
  the Secretary that--
  `(1) such purchase was made solely with non-Federal funds;
  `(2) such purchase would not have been made except for use on a planned
  extension that is eligible for assistance under section 3; and

  Section 8 of the Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1607) is amended to read as follows:
`SEC. 8. COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION STRATEGIES.
  `(a) METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION STRATEGIES-
  `(1) IN GENERAL- It is in the national interest to encourage and promote
  the development of transportation systems that integrate various modes
  of transportation and efficiently maximize mobility of people and goods
  within and through urbanized areas and minimize transportation-related
  fuel consumption and air pollution. The Secretary shall cooperate with
  State and local officials in metropolitan areas in the development of
  comprehensive transportation strategies for achieving this objective.
  `(2) METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- A metropolitan planning organization shall be designated
  for each urbanized area of more than 50,000 in population by agreement among
  the Governor and units of general purpose local government representing at
  least 75 percent of the affected population, including the central city or
  cities, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. In those metropolitan areas
  eligible for designation as transportation management areas in accordance
  with subparagraph (D), the metropolitan planning organization shall include
  local elected officials, officials of agencies that administer or operate
  major modes of transportation in the metropolitan area, (including, at
  a minimum, all transportation agencies that were included as of June 1,
  1991) and appropriate State officials. For purposes of this section, the
  term `metropolitan area' shall mean an area for which one metropolitan
  planning organization is responsible.
  `(B) CONTINUING DESIGNATION- Designations of metropolitan planning
  organizations, whether made under this or earlier provisions of law,
  shall remain in effect until revoked by agreement among the Governor and
  the affected units of general purpose local government, or as otherwise
  provided under State or local procedures, except that a metropolitan
  planning organization (i) shall be redesignated within a period of
  12 months if the metropolitan area is designated as a transportation
  management area under subparagraph (D), and (ii) metropolitan planning
  organizations may be reorganized by agreement among the Governor and units
  of general purpose local government representing at least 75 percent of the
  affected population including the central city or cities, as defined by the
  Bureau of the Census, as appropriate to carry out the provisions of this
  Act. The Secretary shall establish practicable procedures and timetables
  that the Secretary determines to be appropriate for metropolitan planning
  organizations to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A).
  `(C) RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNOR- When a metropolitan planning
  organization is designated or reorganized, the Governor shall ensure that
  the metropolitan planning organization is structured to--
  `(i) give balanced assessment to all modes of transportation, including
  roadway and public transit facilities;
  `(ii) give full consideration to the need for mobility of people and goods
  into and through central cities within the metropolitan area; and
  `(iii) otherwise carry out the metropolitan planning organization's
  responsibilities under Federal law. The Governor shall certify to the
  Secretary that the requirements of this subparagraph have been met.
  `(D) TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT AREAS- The Secretary shall publish and
  annually update a list of those metropolitan areas that--
  `(i) have populations of more than 250,000; or
  `(ii) are nonattainment areas under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401
  et seq.).
The Secretary shall designate such areas to be transportation management
areas. The Secretary may designate additional metropolitan areas to be
transportation management areas upon the request of the Governor and the
metropolitan planning organization. Such additional metropolitan areas may
include ecologically fragile areas of national significance that are expected
to be significantly affected by transportation decisions. The designation
of a transportation management area shall remain in effect until revoked by
the Secretary. The metropolitan planning organization in a transportation
management area shall carry out a continuing, cooperative and comprehensive
transportation planning and programming process in cooperation with the State
and transit operators and have such additional authorities and responsibilities
as are specified in this Act.
  `(E) TRANSITIONAL PROVISION- The Secretary shall designate as transportation
  management areas--
  `(i) not less than 20 percent of the metropolitan areas on the list in
  subparagraph (D) within 1 year after the date of enactment of this section;
  `(ii) not less than 40 percent of such areas within 2 years after the date
  of enactment of this section;
  `(iii) not less than 60 percent of such areas within 3 years after the
  date of enactment of this section;
  `(iv) not less than 80 percent of such areas within 4 years after the date
  of enactment of this section; and
  `(v) all such areas thereafter.
To the extent the Secretary deems practicable after taking into account local
circumstances, the Secretary shall exceed the percentages required in this
subparagraph and give priority to designation of metropolitan areas that
have the most severe problems of air quality and traffic congestion. The
Secretary shall designate all nonattainment areas that are classified under
the Clean Air Act as moderate, serious, severe, or extreme nonattainment
areas for ozone or serious nonattainment areas for carbon monoxide within
2 years after the date of enactment of the Federal Transit Act of 1991.
  `(3) METROPOLITAN AREA BOUNDARIES-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- For the purposes of this Act, the boundaries of any
  metropolitan area shall be determined by agreement between the metropolitan
  planning organization and the Governor. Each metropolitan area shall include
  at least the existing urbanized area and the contiguous area that can
  reasonably be expected to be urbanized within the subsequent 20-year period.
  `(B) TREATMENT OF LARGE URBAN AREAS- More than 1 metropolitan planning
  organization may be designated within a metropolitan statistical area,
  as defined by the Bureau of the Census, if--
  `(i) more than 1 metropolitan planning organization was designated within
  such area on January 1, 1991; and
  `(ii) the Secretary determines that the size and complexity of the urbanized
  area make designation of more than 1 metropolitan planning organization
  appropriate.
If more than 1 metropolitan planning organization has authority within
a metropolitan statistical area, appropriate provision, as determined by
the Secretary, shall be made to coordinate the metropolitan transportation
strategies within such urban area.
  `(C) INCLUSION OF CLEAN AIR NONATTAINMENT AREAS- Any area that--
  `(i) is found to be in nonattainment for any transportation-related
  pollutant under the Clean Air Act; or
  `(ii) is determined by the Governor and the metropolitan planning
  organization to be likely to be significantly affected by air pollution
  within a reasonable period of time shall be included within the boundaries
  of the appropriate metropolitan area, as determined by the Governor and the
  metropolitan planning organization. If more than one metropolitan planning
  organization has authority within a nonattainment area, appropriate
  provision, as determined by the Secretary, shall be made to coordinate
  the metropolitan transportation strategies within such nonattainment area.
  `(D) COORDINATION IN MULTI-STATE AREAS-
  `(i) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall establish such requirements as
  the Secretary deems appropriate to encourage Governors and metropolitan
  planning organizations with responsibility for a portion of a multi-State
  Metropolitan Statistical Area or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
  Area, as defined by the Bureau of the Census, to provide coordinated
  transportation planning for the entire Metropolitan Statistical Area or
  Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area.
  `(ii) COMPACTS- The consent of the Congress is hereby given to any 2 or
  more States to enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any
  law of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance
  in support of activities authorized under this section as they pertain to
  interstate areas and to localities within such States, and to establish
  such agencies, joint or otherwise, as they may deem desirable for making
  such agreements and compacts effective.
  `(4) DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- Each metropolitan planning organization shall prepare
  and update periodically, according to a schedule that the Secretary
  determines to be appropriate, a metropolitan transportation strategy for its
  metropolitan area as provided in this section. In developing the strategy,
  the metropolitan planning organization shall consider the environmental,
  energy, land use, and other regional effects of all transportation projects
  to be undertaken within the metropolitan area, without regard to funding
  source.
  `(B) PUBLICATION OF STRATEGIES- A metropolitan transportation strategy
  shall be--
  `(i) published or otherwise made readily available for public review; and
  `(ii) submitted for information purposes to the Governor at such times
  and in such manner as the Secretary shall establish as appropriate for
  the publication and submission of metropolitan transportation strategies
  to carry out this section.
  `(C) COORDINATION WITH CLEAN AIR ACT AGENCIES- In nonattainment areas for
  transportation-related pollutants, the metropolitan planning organization
  shall coordinate the development of a metropolitan transportation strategy
  with the process for development of the transportation measures of the
  State Implementation Plan required by the Clean Air Act.
  `(D) PARTICIPATION BY INTERESTED PARTIES- Prior to approving a metropolitan
  transportation strategy, each metropolitan planning organization shall
  provide citizens, affected public agencies, representatives of transportation
  agency employees, private providers of transportation and other interested
  parties with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the development
  of the strategy, in a manner that the Secretary deems appropriate.
  `(E) CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE- The Secretary shall assure that each
  metropolitan planning organization is carrying out its responsibilities
  under applicable provisions of Federal law. The Secretary shall, not less
  frequently than every 3 years, provide certification to those metropolitan
  planning organizations that, in the opinion of the Secretary, are carrying
  out applicable requirements of Federal law. If the Secretary finds, after
  reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that a metropolitan planning
  organization is not carrying out its responsibilities under applicable
  provisions of Federal law, the Secretary shall deny certification and,
  until corrective action satisfactory to the Secretary is taken, may suspend
  or disapprove in whole or in part the expenditure within the metropolitan
  area of funds made available under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1991 or
  this Act. The Secretary shall not (i) withhold certification under this
  section based upon the policies and criteria established by a metropolitan
  planning organization for determining the feasibility of private enterprise
  participation in accordance with section 8(e), or (ii) otherwise impede
  a metropolitan planning organization's implementation of such policies
  and criteria.
  `(5) CONTENTS OF STRATEGY- A metropolitan transportation strategy under this
  section shall be in a form that the Secretary determines to be appropriate
  and shall, at a minimum--
  `(A) identify transportation facilities (including but not necessarily
  limited to major roadways, mass transit, and multimodal and intermodal
  facilities) that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation
  system, giving emphasis to those facilities that serve important national
  and regional transportation functions, such as--
  `(i) moving goods within the metropolitan area and among distant markets;
  `(ii) enabling people to move quickly to and from home, jobs and other
  destinations; and
  `(iii) connecting complementary modes of transportation (such as highways,
  transit systems, ports, railroads and airlines);
  `(B) assess major demands on the metropolitan transportation system,
  projected over the subsequent 20-year period;
  `(C) set forth a long-range strategy for meeting metropolitan area personal
  mobility and goods transportation needs, including State and local actions
  to manage travel demand, improve transportation operations and management,
  increase the efficiency and effectiveness of existing facilities, or
  provide new transportation capacity; and
  `(D) explain how proposed transportation decisions will--
  `(i) achieve compliance with applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act,
  the Clean Water Act, and other environmental and resource conservation laws;
  `(ii) further applicable Federal, State and local energy conservation
  programs, goals and objectives; and
  `(iii) affect other important social, economic and environmental objectives
  of the metropolitan area as reflected in publicly adopted plans, such as
  those concerning housing, community development, and historic preservation;
  `(E) explain--
  `(i) the extent to which State and local policies regarding land use and
  transportation will affect metropolitan-wide mobility; and
  `(ii) how proposed transportation decisions will affect future travel
  demand, growth in vehicle use, mobile source emissions, and land use and
  development, taking into consideration the provisions of all applicable
  short-term and long-term land use and development plans;
  `(F) include a financial plan that demonstrates how the metropolitan
  transportation strategy can be implemented, which plan shall indicate
  resources from all sources that are reasonably expected to be made available
  to carry out the strategy, and recommend any innovative financing techniques
  to finance needed projects and programs, including such techniques as
  value capture, tolls, and congestion pricing;
  `(G) project capital investment and other measures necessary to--
  `(i) ensure the preservation of the existing metropolitan transportation
  system, including requirements for operations, resurfacing, restoration and
  rehabilitation of existing and future major roadways, as well as operations,
  maintenance, modernization and rehabilitation of existing and future public
  transit facilities; and
  `(ii) make the most efficient use of existing transportation facilities
  to relieve vehicular congestion and maximize the mobility of people and
  goods; and
  `(H) indicate as appropriate proposed transportation enhancement activities.

  not designated as transportation management areas under paragraph (2)(D),
  the Secretary may provide for the development of abbreviated metropolitan
  transportation strategies that the Secretary determines to be appropriate
  to achieve the purposes of this section, taking into account the complexity
  of transportation problems, including transportation related air quality
  problems, in such areas.
  `(7) STATEWIDE STRATEGY- The State shall develop a statewide transportation
  strategy, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that shall take into
  account the transportation needs of areas for which no metropolitan planning
  organization has been designated.
  `(b) TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS-
  `(1) DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS-
  `(A) IN GENERAL- The metropolitan planning organization, in cooperation
  with the State and relevant transit operators, shall develop and submit
  to the Secretary for review a transportation improvement program for the
  ensuing period of not less than 3 years and, to the extent practicable,
  for subsequent periods of not less than 3 years.
  `(B) CONTENTS- The program shall--
  `(i) include all projects within the metropolitan area proposed for funding
  pursuant to the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1991 and this Act, except as
  provided in clause (iii);
  `(ii) conform with the approved metropolitan transportation strategy and
  the State Implementation Plan required under the Clean Air Act; and
  `(iii) include a project, or an identified phase of a project, only if full
  funding for such project or project phase can reasonably be anticipated to
  be available within the period of time contemplated for completion of the
  project and, in the case of a major project to expand the transportation
  capacity, an appropriate range of alternatives has been analyzed pursuant
  to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).

  shall update or reapprove the program not less frequently than annually,
  except that the Secretary may provide for a less frequent updating for
  areas that are not designated to be transportation management areas,
  as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. A metropolitan planning
  organization may amend the program at any time, if the amendment is
  consistent with the metropolitan transportation strategy.
  `(3) NOTICE AND COMMENT- Prior to approving a transportation improvement
  program, a metropolitan planning organization shall provide citizens,
  affected public agencies, representatives of transportation agency employees,
  private providers of transportation, and other interested parties with
  reasonable notice of and an opportunity to comment on the proposed program.
  `(4) PRIORITY PROJECTS- The program shall identify priority projects
  reflecting projected funding and the objectives of the metropolitan
  transportation strategy that shall be carried out for each relevant
  programming period.
  `(5) STATE PROGRAMS- The Governor shall develop and submit to the Secretary,
  in a form acceptable to the Secretary, a transportation improvement
  program covering a period of not less than 3 years for areas for which no
  metropolitan planning organization has been designated and shall include

  areas. Such funds shall be allocated according to a formula that reflects
  the additional costs of carrying out planning, programming, and project
  selection responsibilities under this section in such areas.
  `(4) HOLD HARMLESS- The Secretary shall ensure, to the maximum extent
  practicable, that no metropolitan planning organization is allocated
  less than the amount it received by administrative formula under section
  8 of this Act in fiscal year 1991. To comply with the previous sentence,
  the Secretary is authorized to make a pro rata reduction in other amounts
  made available to carry out section 21(c).
