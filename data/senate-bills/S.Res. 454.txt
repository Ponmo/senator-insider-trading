                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate that the 108th Congress should 
 provide the necessary funds to make disaster assistance available for 
 all customarily eligible agricultural producers as emergency spending 
                and not funded by cuts to the farm bill.

Whereas, agriculture has been the cornerstone of every civilization throughout 
        history and remains the driving force behind the nation's economy;
Whereas, American farmers and ranchers help keep food affordable in this country 
        and also help to feed the world;
Whereas, America's farmers and ranchers produce the food and fiber that is so 
        vital to our economy while protecting our soil, helping to keep our 
        waters clean, and reducing air pollution across the country;
Whereas, all sectors of our country rely in some way on a successful, strong and 
        vibrant agriculture industry;
Whereas, it is the nature of agriculture that farmers and ranchers will suffer 
        production losses because of the vagaries of weather;
Whereas, Congress has responded to natural disasters by providing assistance to 
        those affected including the nation's farmers and ranchers to help 
        restore financial stability in times of such losses; and
Whereas, Congress has traditionally provided such assistance on an emergency 
        basis without cutting programs to the class of those suffering.
    Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that the 108th 
Congress should provide the necessary funds to make disaster assistance 
available for all customarily eligible agricultural producers as 
emergency spending and not funded by cuts to the farm bill.
