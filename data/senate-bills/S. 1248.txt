        <DELETED>    ``(1) Disability is a natural part of the human 
        experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to 
        participate in or contribute to society. Improving educational 
        results for children with disabilities is an essential element 
        of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, 
        full participation, independent living, and economic self-
        sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.</DELETED>

        Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law

        disabilities were not being fully met because--</DELETED>

                appropriate educational services;</DELETED>

                from the public school system and from being educated

                the children from having a successful educational 
                experience; or</DELETED>

        the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this 
        Act has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities 
        and the families of such children access to a free appropriate 
        public education and in improving educational results for 
        children with disabilities.</DELETED>

                children and ensuring their access to the general

                efforts under the Elementary and Secondary Education 
                Act of 2001, in order to ensure that such children 
                benefit from such efforts and that special education

                need to label children as disabled in order to address 
                their learning and behavioral needs;</DELETED>

    ``(c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience 
        and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to 
        participate in or contribute to society. Improving educational 
        results for children with disabilities is an essential element 
        of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, 
        full participation, independent living, and economic self-
        sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.
            ``(2) Before the date of the enactment of the Education for 
        All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142), the 
        educational needs of millions of children with disabilities 
        were not being fully met because--
                    ``(A) the children did not receive appropriate 
                educational services;
                    ``(B) the children were excluded entirely from the 
                public school system and from being educated with their 
                peers;
                    ``(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the 
                children from having a successful educational 
                experience; or
                    ``(D) a lack of adequate resources within the 
                public school system forced families to find services 
                outside the public school system.
            ``(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the 
        Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this Act 
        has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and 
        the families of such children access to a free appropriate 
        public education and in improving educational results for 
        children with disabilities.
            ``(4) However, the implementation of this Act has been 
        impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on 
        applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching and 
        learning for children with disabilities.
            ``(5) Over 25 years of research and experience has 
        demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities 
        can be made more effective by--
                    ``(A) having high expectations for such children 
                and ensuring their access to the general education 
                curriculum in the regular classroom to the maximum 
                extent possible in order to--
                            ``(i) meet developmental goals and, to the 
                        maximum extent possible, the challenging 
                        expectations that have been established for all 
                        children; and
                            ``(ii) be prepared to lead productive and 
                        independent adult lives, to the maximum extent 
                        possible;
                    ``(B) strengthening the role and responsibility of 
                parents and ensuring that families of such children 
                have meaningful opportunities to participate in the 
                education of their children at school and at home;
                    ``(C) coordinating this Act with other local, 
                educational service agency, State, and Federal school 
                improvement efforts, including improvement efforts 
                under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
                1965, in order to ensure that such children benefit 
                from such efforts and that special education can become 
                a service for such children rather than a place where 
                they are sent;
                    ``(D) providing appropriate special education and 
                related services, and aids and supports in the regular 
                classroom, to such children, whenever appropriate;
                    ``(E) supporting high-quality, intensive preservice 
                preparation and professional development for all 
                personnel who work with children with disabilities in 
                order to ensure that such personnel have the skills and 
                knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement 
                and functional performance of children with 
                disabilities, including the use of scientifically based 
                instructional practices, to the maximum extent 
                possible;
                    ``(F) providing incentives for whole-school 
                approaches, scientifically based early reading 
                programs, positive behavioral interventions and 
                supports, and prereferral interventions to reduce the 
                need to label children as disabled in order to address 
                their learning and behavioral needs;
                    ``(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning 
                while reducing paperwork and requirements that do not 
                assist in improving educational results; and
                    ``(H) supporting the development and use of 
                technology, including assistive technology devices and 
                assistive technology services, to maximize 
                accessibility for children with disabilities.
            ``(6) While States, local educational agencies, and 
        educational service agencies are primarily responsible for 
        providing an education for all children with disabilities, it 
        is in the national interest that the Federal Government have a 
        supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to educate 
        children with disabilities in order to improve results for such 
        children and to ensure equal protection of the law.
            ``(7) A more equitable allocation of resources is essential 
        for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to 
        provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.
            ``(8) Parents and schools should be given expanded 
        opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and 
        constructive ways.
            ``(9) Teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and 
        States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary 
        paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational 
        outcomes.
            ``(10)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the 
        growing needs of an increasingly more diverse society.
            ``(B) America's ethnic profile is rapidly changing. In the 
        year 2000, 1 of every 3 persons in the United States was a 
        member of a minority group or was limited English proficient.
            ``(C) Minority children comprise an increasing percentage 
        of public school students.
            ``(D) With such changing demographics, recruitment efforts 
        for special education personnel should focus on increasing the 
        participation of minorities in the teaching profession.
            ``(11)(A) The limited English proficient population is the 
        fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in 
        many parts of our Nation.
            ``(B) Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the 
        levels of referral and placement of limited English proficient 
        children in special education.
            ``(C) This poses a special challenge for special education 
        in the referral of, assessment of, and services for, our 
        Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.
            ``(12)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the 
        intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and high 
        dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.
            ``(B) More minority children continue to be served in 
        special education than would be expected from the percentage of 
        minority students in the general school population.
            ``(C) African-American children are identified as having 
        mental retardation and emotional disturbance at rates greater 
        than their white counterparts.
            ``(D) In the 1998-1999 school year, African-American 
        children represented just 14.8 percent of the population aged 6 
        through 21, but comprised 20.2 percent of all children with 
        disabilities.
            ``(E) Studies have found that schools with predominately 
        Caucasian students and teachers have placed disproportionately 
        high numbers of their minority students into special education.
            ``(13)(A) As the number of minority students in special 
        education increases, the number of minority teachers and 
        related services personnel produced in colleges and 
        universities continues to decrease.
            ``(B) The opportunity for minority individuals, 
        organizations, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
        to participate fully in awards for grants and contracts, boards 
        of organizations receiving funds under this Act, and peer 
        review panels, and in the training of professionals in the area 
        of special education is essential if we are to obtain greater 
        success in the education of minority children with 
        disabilities.
            ``(14) As the graduation rates for children with 
        disabilities continue to climb, providing effective transition

        an individualized education program or, if consistent with

    ``(c) Notification of Local Educational Agency or State Agency in 
Case of Ineligibility.--If the State educational agency determines that

determination and shall provide such local educational agency or State 
agency with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    ``(d) Local Educational Agency Compliance.--
            ``(1) In general.--If the State educational agency, after 
        reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, finds that 
        a local educational agency or State agency that has been 
        determined to be eligible under this section is failing to 
        comply with any requirement described in subsection (a), the 
        State educational agency shall reduce or shall not provide any 
        further payments to the local educational agency or State 
        agency until the State educational agency is satisfied that the 
        local educational agency or State agency, as the case may be, 
        is complying with that requirement.

        pursuant to this subsection to the attention of the public 
        within the jurisdiction of such agency.
            ``(3) Consideration.--In carrying out its responsibilities 
        under paragraph (1), the State educational agency shall 
        consider any decision made in a hearing held under section 615 
        that is adverse to the local educational agency or State agency 
        involved in that decision.

                eligibility jointly with another local educational 
                agency if the State educational agency determines that 
                the local educational agency will be ineligible under 
                this section because the local educational agency will 
                not be able to establish and maintain programs of 
                sufficient size and scope to effectively meet the needs 
                of children with disabilities.

        requires the joint establishment of eligibility under paragraph 
        (1), the total amount of funds made available to the affected 
        local educational agencies shall be equal to the sum of the 
        payments that each such local educational agency would have 
        received under section 611(f) if such agencies were eligible 
        for such payments.

        a child with a disability under section 602(3) but who need 
        additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a

educational agency include in the records of a child with a disability 
a statement of any current or previous disciplinary action that has 
been taken against the child and transmit such statement to the same 
extent that such disciplinary information is included in, and 
transmitted with, the student records of nondisabled children. The 
statement may include a description of any behavior engaged in by the 
child that required disciplinary action, a description of the 
disciplinary action taken, and any other information that is relevant 
to the safety of the child and other individuals involved with the 
child. If the State adopts such a policy, and the child transfers from 
1 school to another, the transmission of any of the child's records

convicted as adults under State law and incarcerated in adult prisons 
is assigned to a public agency other than the State educational agency 
pursuant to section 612(a)(11)(C), the Secretary, in instances where 
the Secretary finds that the failure to comply substantially with the

part, except that--

        other public agency is proportionate to the number of eligible 
        individuals with disabilities in the State under the 
        supervision of the State educational agency; and

``SEC. 631. FINDINGS AND POLICY.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that there is an urgent and 
substantial need--
            ``(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers 
        with disabilities, to minimize their potential for 
        developmental delay, and to recognize the significant brain 
        development which occurs during a child's first 3 years of 
        life;
            ``(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, 
        including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for 
        special education and related services after infants and 
        toddlers with disabilities reach school age;
            ``(3) to maximize the potential for individuals with 
        disabilities to live independently in society;
            ``(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the 
        special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities; 
        and

        and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs 
        of all children, particularly minority, low-income, inner city, 
        and rural children.
    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to provide 
financial assistance to States--

        provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers 
        with disabilities and their families;
            ``(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early 
        intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private 
        sources (including public and private insurance coverage);
            ``(3) to enhance State capacity to provide high quality 
        early intervention services and expand and improve existing 
        early intervention services being provided to infants and 
        toddlers with disabilities and their families; and
            ``(4) to encourage States to expand opportunities for 
        children under 3 years of age who would be at risk of having 
        substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early 
        intervention services.
