SEC. 506. MODERNIZATION OF NUCLEAR REACTOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS.

    (a) In General <<NOTE: Reports. Assessments.>> .--Not later than 180 
days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall 
submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the efforts 
of the Commission to facilitate efficient, timely, and predictable 
environmental reviews of nuclear reactor applications for a license 
under section 103 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2133), 
including through expanded use of categorical exclusions, environmental 
assessments, and generic environmental impact statements.

    (b) Report.--In completing the report under subsection (a), the 
Commission shall--
            (1) describe the actions the Commission will take to 
        implement the amendments to the National Environmental Policy 
        Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) made by section 321 of the 
        Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5; 137 Stat. 
        38);
            (2) consider--
                    (A) using, through adoption, incorporation by 
                reference, or other appropriate means, categorical 
                exclusions, environmental assessments, and environmental 
                impact statements

[[Page 138 STAT. 1479]]

                prepared by other Federal agencies to streamline 
                environmental reviews of applications described in 
                subsection (a) by the Commission;
                    (B) using categorical exclusions, environmental 
                assessments, and environmental impact statements 
                prepared by the Commission to streamline environmental 
                reviews of applications described in subsection (a) by 
                the Commission;
                    (C) using mitigated findings of no significant 
                impact in environmental reviews of applications 
                described in subsection (a) by the Commission to reduce 
                the impact of a proposed action to a level that is not 
                significant;
                    (D) the extent to which the Commission may rely on 
                prior studies or analyses prepared by Federal, State, 
                and local governmental permitting agencies to streamline 
                environmental reviews of applications described in 
                subsection (a) by the Commission;
                    (E) opportunities to coordinate the development of 
                environmental assessments and environmental impact 
                statements with other Federal agencies to avoid 
                duplicative environmental reviews and to streamline 
                environmental reviews of applications described in 
                subsection (a) by the Commission;
                    (F) opportunities to streamline formal and informal 
                consultations and coordination with other Federal, 
                State, and local governmental permitting agencies during 
                environmental reviews of applications described in 
                subsection (a) by the Commission;
                    (G) opportunities to streamline the Commission's 
                analyses of alternatives, including the Commission's 
                analysis of alternative sites, in environmental reviews 
                of applications described in subsection (a) by the 
                Commission;
                    (H) establishing new categorical exclusions that 
                could be applied to actions relating to new applications 
                described in subsection (a);
                    (I) amending section 51.20(b) of title 10, Code of 
                Federal Regulations, to allow the Commission to 
                determine, on a case-specific basis, whether an 
                environmental assessment (rather than an environmental 
                impact statement or supplemental environmental impact 
                statement) is appropriate for a particular application 
                described in subsection (a), including in proceedings in 
                which the Commission relies on a generic environmental 
                impact statement for advanced nuclear reactors;
                    (J) authorizing the use of an applicant's 
                environmental impact statement as the Commission's draft 
                environmental impact statement, consistent with section 
                107(f) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
                (42 U.S.C. 4336a(f));
                    (K) opportunities to adopt online and digital 
                technologies, including technologies that would allow 
                applicants and cooperating agencies to upload documents 
                and coordinate with the Commission to edit documents in 
                real time, that would streamline communications 
                between--
                          (i) the Commission and applicants; and
                          (ii) the Commission and other relevant 
                      cooperating agencies; and

                    (L) in addition to implementing measures under 
                paragraph (3), potential revisions to part 51 of title 
                10, Code of Federal Regulations, and relevant Commission 
                guidance documents--
                          (i) to facilitate efficient, timely, and 
                      predictable environmental reviews of applications 
                      described in subsection (a);
                          (ii) to assist decision making about relevant

                          (iv) to meet obligations under the National 
                      Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
                      et seq.); and
                          (v) to reduce burdens on licensees, 
                      applicants, and the Commission; and
