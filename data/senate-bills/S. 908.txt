    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Diplomatic Telecommunications Service Program

        made to the DTS network (in order for the DTS to accommodate 
        present and future telecommunications requirements

        international trade and export markets and ensure fair 
        competitive conditions for United States exporters.

        assisting United States businesses when competing for overseas 
        contracts by disclosing information about bribery or corruption 
        of other foreign nationals competing for the contract; and
            (4) make recommendations for any legislation which may be 
        necessary or appropriate to carry out such proposals.

SEC. 171. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BORDER CROSSING FEES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) in the budget of the United States for fiscal year 1996 
        that was submitted to Congress, the President proposed to 
        impose and collect a border crossing fee for individuals and 
        vehicles entering the United States;
            (2) both the Canadian and Mexican governments have 
        expressed opposition to the imposition and collection of such a 
        fee and have raised the possibility of imposing retaliatory 
        border crossing fees of their own;
            (3) the imposition and collection of such a fee would have 
        adverse affects on tourism and commerce that depend on travel 
        across the borders of the United States;
            (4) the imposition and collection of such a fee would have 
        such effects without addressing illegal immigration in a 
        meaningful way;
            (5) on February 22, 1995, the President modified his 
        proposal making the imposition of the new fees voluntary on 
        United States border States (but tied the availability of 
        Federal funds to improve border crossing infrastructure on 
        their willingness to impose such fees); and
            (6) on May 4, 1995, the President further modified the 
        border crossing fee proposal in immigration control legislation 
        he submitted to Congress setting a $1.50 per car and $.75 per 
        pedestrian fee structure.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
the United States Government should not impose or collect a border 
crossing fee along its borders with Canada and Mexico.

Representative of the United States to the United Nations should make 
every effort to ensure that the United Nations completes an overall 
review and reassessment of each nation's assessed contributions for 
United Nations peacekeeping operations. As part of the overall review 
and assessment, the Permanent Representative should make every effort 
to advance the concept that, when appropriate, host governments and 
other governments in the region where a United Nations peacekeeping 
operation is carried out should bear a greater burden of its financial 
cost.
    ``(b) Limitation on Assessed Contribution With Respect to a 
Peacekeeping Operation.--(1) Funds authorized to be appropriated for 
`Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities' for any 
fiscal year shall not be available for the payment of the United States 
assessed contribution for a United Nations peacekeeping operation in an 
amount which is greater than 25 percent of the total amount of all 
assessed contributions for that operation, and any arrearages that 
accumulate as a result of assessments in excess of 25 percent of the 
total amount of all assessed contributions for any United Nations 
peacekeeping operation shall not be recognized or paid by the United 
States.
    ``(2) Any penalties, interest, or other charges imposed on the 
United States in connection with such contributions shall be credited 
as a part of the percentage limitation contained in the preceding 
sentence.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The limitation contained in section 11(b) of 
the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as added by subsection 
(a), shall apply only with respect to funds authorized to be 
appropriated for ``Contributions for International Peacekeeping 
Activities'' for fiscal years after fiscal year 1995.
    (c) Conforming Repeal.--Section 404 of the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, is repealed.

amended by adding after subsection (b), as added by this Act, the 
following new subsections:

expended to pay any United States assessed or voluntary contribution 
for United Nations peacekeeping activities unless the Secretary of 
State determines and certifies to the designated congressional 
committees that United States manufacturers and suppliers are being
 given opportunities to provide equipment, services, and material for 
such activities equal to those being given to foreign manufacturers and 
suppliers.
    ``(d) Designated Congressional Committees Defined.--As used in this 
section, the term `designated congressional committees' means--
            ``(1) the Committee on International Relations and the 
        Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives; 
        and
            ``(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee 
        on Appropriations of the Senate.''.

agreed to and implemented by the United Nations for protecting 
intelligence sources and methods as a condition for the provision of 
United States intelligence information to the United Nations. Those

        through existing bilateral intelligence-sharing agreements; and
            ``(G) other measures which shall protect intelligence 
        sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure in accordance 
        with section 103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 
        U.S.C. 403-3(c)(5)).
    ``(2) Paragraph (1) may be waived upon written certification by the 
President to the appropriate committees of Congress that providing such 
information to the United Nations or an organization affiliated with 
the United Nations, or to any officials or employees thereof, is in the

possible measures protecting such information have been taken, except 
that such waiver must be made for each instance such information is 
provided, or for each such document provided.

        Representatives on the types and volume of intelligence 
        provided to the United Nations and the purposes for which it 
        was provided during the period covered by the report. The 
        President shall also report to the Select Committee on 
        Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee 
        on Intelligence of the House of Representatives within 15 days 
        after it has become known to the United States Government 
        regarding any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence provided 
        by the United States to the United Nations.
            ``(2) The requirement for periodic reports under the first 
        sentence of paragraph (1) shall not apply to the provision of

    ``(c) Delegation of Duties.--The President may not delegate or

            ``(C) the development of democratic institutions.
    ``(2) Not less than 15 days before approving a license for export 
of any item under paragraph (1), the President shall notify the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on 
International Relations of the House of Representatives in accordance 
with procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications under section

    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to measures applied by the United States pursuant to a request of 
the United Nations Security Council made on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act.

SEC. 218. UNPROFOR FUNDING RESTRICTIONS.

    None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act may be 
made available for contributions to the United Nations Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) unless the President certifies and reports to the Congress 
during the calendar years in which the funds are to be provided that--
            (1) the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina supports the continued presence of UNPROFOR within 
        its territory;
            (2) UNPROFOR is effectively implementing its mandate under 
        United Nations Security Council resolutions 761, 776, 786, 836, 
        and 958, and is effectively encouraging compliance with United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions 752, 757, 770, 771, 787, 
        820, 824, and 942;
            (3) UNPROFOR is providing full cooperation and support to 
        the efforts of the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal for the 
        former Yugoslavia to investigate war crimes and to apprehend 
        and prosecute suspected war criminals;
            (4) UNPROFOR is providing full cooperation and support to 
        United States diplomatic, military, and relief personnel in 
        Bosnia, to include transportation and accurate information; and
            (5) UNPROFOR has investigated and taken appropriate action 
        against any UNPROFOR civilian or military personnel suspected 
        of participating in illegal or improper activities, such as 
        black marketeering, embezzlement, expropriation of property, 
        and assaults on civilians.

SEC. 219. ESCALATING COSTS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) in fiscal year 1989 the United States provided 
        $29,000,000 to the United Nations for assessed United States 
        contributions for international peacekeeping activities, 
        compared to $485,000,000 paid for combined assessed 
        contributions for all other international organizations, 
        including the United Nations, all United Nations specialized 
        agencies and the Organization for American States and all other 
        pan American international organizations;
            (2) in fiscal year 1994 United States assessed 
        contributions to the United Nations for international 
        peacekeeping activities had grown to $1,072,000,000, compared 
        to $860,000,000 for combined assessed contributions for all 
        other international organizations;
            (3) for fiscal year 1995 the President requested a 
        $672,000,000 United Nations peacekeeping supplemental 
        appropriation which, if approved, would have been a direct 
        increase in the Federal budget deficit and would have brought 
        fiscal year 1995 total appropriations for assessed 
        contributions for United Nations peacekeeping activities to 
        $1,025,000,000;
            (4) for fiscal year 1995 the President also requested 
        supplemental appropriations of $1,900,000,000 to cover the 
        Department of Defense's unbudgeted costs for humanitarian and 
        peacekeeping missions in Haiti, Kuwait and Bosnia, which are in 
        addition to regular United States assessed contributions to the 
        United Nations for peacekeeping activities; and
            (5) for fiscal year 1996 the President requested 
        $445,000,000 for assessed contributions to the United Nations 
        for international peacekeeping activities, a funding level most 
        observers believe to be a significant understatement of actual 
        peacekeeping obligations the Administration has committed the 
        United States to support and which, if accurate, would lead to 
        the third year in a row in which the Administration requests 
        supplemental appropriations for assessed contributions to 
        international peacekeeping in excess of $600 million outside of 
        the regular budget process.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
Executive Branch should cease obligating the United States to pay for 
international peacekeeping operations in excess of funds specifically 
authorized and appropriated for this purpose.

SEC. 220. DEFINITION.

    The United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended by this 
Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following new section:

``SEC. 13. DEFINITION.

                afforded at previous major United Nations conferences;
                    (iv) that the United States delegation to the 
                Fourth World Conference on Women vigorously and 
                publicly supported access by representatives of 
                accredited nongovernmental organizations to the

SEC. 304. INTER-AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS.

    Taking into consideration the long-term commitment by the United 
States to the affairs of this Hemisphere and the need to build further 
upon the linkages between the United States and its neighbors, it is 
the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State, in allocating 
the level of resources for international organizations, should pay 
particular attention to funding levels of the Inter-American 
organizations.

                     CHAPTER 2--GENERAL PROVISIONS

            (1) On April 2, 1992, the Senate approved a resolution 
        advising and consenting to ratification of the International 
        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, subject to 
        reservations, understandings, declarations, and a proviso

        Political Rights on June 8, 1992, and the Covenant entered into

        established under the Covenant to interpret the Covenant and to 
        receive complaints of noncompliance, adopted General Comment 
        No. 24 regarding reservations to the Covenant.
            (4) In General Comment No. 24, the Human Rights Committee 
        claimed for itself the power to judge the validity under 
        international law of reservations to the Covenant, and in the 
        purported exercise of this power asserted that reservations of 
        the type included in the Senate resolution of ratification are 
        invalid, and further asserted that invalid reservations will be 
        read out of instruments of ratification, ``in the sense that 
        the Covenant will be operative for the reserving party without 
        benefit of the reservation''.
            (5) The purpose and effect of General Comment No. 24 is to 
        seek to nullify as a matter of international law the 
        reservations, understandings, declarations, and proviso 
        contained in the Senate resolution of ratification, thereby 
        purporting to impose legal obligations on the United States 
        never accepted by the United States.
            (6) General Comment No. 24 threatens not only the Supremacy 
        Clause of the United States Constitution and the constitutional 
        authority of the Senate with respect to the approval of 
        treaties, but also the First Amendment rights of American 
        citizens and the other United States constitutional rights and 
        practices protected by the reservations, understandings, 
        declarations, and proviso contained in the Senate resolution of 
        ratification.
    (b) Restriction on Obligation or Expenditure of Funds.--
            (1) Restriction.--Effective on the date of enactment of 
        this section, no funds authorized to be appropriated by this 
        Act or any other Act, or otherwise made available may be 
        obligated or expended for the conduct of any activity which has 
        the purpose or effect of--
                    (A) reporting to the Human Rights Committee in 
                accordance with Article 40 of the International 
                Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or
                    (B) responding to any effort by the Human Rights 
                Committee to use the procedures of Articles 41 and 42 
                of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
                Rights to resolve claims by other parties to the 
                Covenant
                 that the United States is not fulfilling its 
obligations under the Covenant,
        until the President has submitted to the Congress the 
        certification described in paragraph (2).
            (2) Certification.--The certification referred to in 
        paragraph (1) is a certification by the President to the 
        Congress that the Human Rights Committee established under the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has--
                    (A) revoked its General Comment No. 24 adopted on 
                November 2, 1994; and
                    (B) expressly recognized the validity as a matter 
                of international law of the reservations, 
                understandings, and declarations contained in the 
                United States instrument of ratification of the 
                International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

SEC. 608. REPORT ON OCCUPIED TIBET.

    (a) Findings and Declarations of Congress.--The Congress makes the 
following findings and declarations:
            (1) Historically, Tibet has demonstrated those attributes 
        which under international law constitute statehood. It has had 
        a defined territory and a permanent population, been under the 
        control of its own government, and has engaged in, or had the 
        capacity to engage in, formal relations with other states.
            (2) Between 1951 and 1959, Tibet was forcibly and 
        coercively incorporated into the People's Republic of China as 
        an ``autonomous region''.
            (3) Because Tibet's incorporation into the People's 
        Republic of China was involuntary, under international law it 
        is an occupied sovereign country and its true representatives 
        continue to be the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-
        exile.
            (4) Because the Tibetan people are historically, 
        territorially, and culturally distinct from the Han Chinese 
        population in the People's Republic of China, and because of 
        the involuntary loss of their sovereignty, they are entitled to 
        the right of self-determination.
            (5) Credible evidence exists which demonstrates that the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently 
        denied the Tibetan people that right, and instead have 
        subjected them to a serious pattern of human rights abuses. For 
        example, in 1960 the International Commission of Jurists found 
        that the Chinese authorities in Tibet had violated sixteen 
        articles of the United Nations Human Rights Declaration.
            (6) Tibet is an occupied sovereign country under 
        international law and its true representatives are the Dalai 
        Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile.
            (7) The United States should seek to establish a dialogue 
        with those recognized by Congress as the true representatives 
        of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama, his representatives, and 
        the Tibetan Government in exile, concerning the situation in 
        Tibet and the future of the Tibetan people and to expand and 
        strengthen United States-Tibet cultural and educational 
        relations, including promoting bilateral exchanges arranged 
        directly with the Tibetan Government in exile.
    (b) Report on United States-Tibet Relations.-- Not later than 6 
months after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 12 months 
thereafter, the Secretary of State shall transmit to the Chairman of 
the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives a report on the state of relations between the United 
States and those recognized by Congress as the true representatives of 
the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama, his representatives, and the 
Tibetan Government in exile, and on conditions in Tibet.
    (c) Separate Tibet Reports.--
            (1) It is the sense of the Congress that whenever an 
        executive branch report is transmitted to the Congress on a 
        country-by-country basis there should be included in such 
        report, where applicable, a separate report on Tibet listed 
        alphabetically with its own state heading.
            (2) The reports referred to in paragraph (1) include, but 
        are not limited to, reports transmitted under sections 116(d) 
        and 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (relating to 
        human rights).

SEC. 609. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR TIBET ACT OF 1995.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Special Envoy 
for Tibet Act of 1995''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China 
        withholds meaningful participation in the governance of Tibet 
        from Tibetans and has failed to abide by its own constitutional 
        guarantee of autonomy for Tibetans;
            (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China is 
        responsible for the destruction of much of Tibet's cultural and 
        religious heritage since 1959 and continues to threaten the 
        survival of Tibetan culture and religion;
            (3) the Government of the People's Republic of China, 
        through direct and indirect incentives--
                    (A) has established discriminatory development and 
                other programs which have resulted in an overwhelming 
                flow of Chinese immigrants into Tibet, including those 
                areas incorporated into the Chinese provinces of 
                Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai; and
                    (B) has excluded Tibetans from participation in 
                important policy decisions, further threatening 
                traditional Tibetan life;
            (4) the Government of the People's Republic of China denies 
        Tibetans their fundamental human rights, as reported in the 
        Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 
        for 1993;
            (5) the President and the Congress have determined that the 
        promotion of human rights in Tibet and the protection of 
        Tibet's religion and culture are important elements in United 
        States-China relations and have urged senior members of the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China to enter into 
        substantive negotiations on these matters with the Dalai Lama 
        or his representative; and
            (6) the Government of the People's Republic of China has 
        failed to respond in a good faith manner by reciprocating a 
        willingness to begin negotiations without preconditions, and no 
        substantive negotiations have begun.
    (c) Position of United States Special Envoy for Tibet.--
            (1) Establishment of position.--There shall be within the 
        Department of State a United States Special Envoy for Tibet, 
        who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice 
        and consent of the Senate. The United States Special Envoy for 
        Tibet shall hold office at the pleasure of the President.
            (2) Rank of ambassador.--The United States Special Envoy 
        for Tibet shall have the personal rank of ambassador.
    (d) Responsibilities.--
            (1) Authorities.--The United States Special Envoy for Tibet

                the Government of the People's Republic of China;
                    (B) to promote good relations between the Dalai 
                Lama and his representatives and the United States 
                Government, including meeting with members or 
                representatives of the Tibetan Government-in-exile; and
                    (C) to travel regularly throughout Tibet and 
                Tibetan refugee settlements.
            (2) Duties.--The United States Special Envoy for Tibet 
        shall--
                    (A) consult with the Congress on policies relevant 
                to Tibet and the future and welfare of all Tibetan 
                people;

 TITLE XVI--PLAN FOR REORGANIZATION OF UNITED STATES EXPORT PROMOTION 
                          AND TRADE ACTIVITIES

SEC. 1601. REPORT.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Supporting American businesses overseas and assisting 
        United States exporters to identify market opportunities is of 
        increasing importance to America's economic health and 
        competitiveness, and to the well-being of American workers.
            (2) At least 18 different government-sponsored 
        organizations or agencies spending over $30,000,000,000 exist 
        to provide support to American exporters and international 
        businesses. In the past, poor coordination among these 
        organizations and a lack of accessibility often hindered the 
        effectiveness of the Government's trade promotion activities.
            (3) Recent efforts to improve coordination between many of 
        these organizations and to increase their availability to 
        exporters around the country were begun through the Trade 
        Promotion Coordination Council. These efforts appear to have 
        generated some improvement in the Government's trade promotion 
        capabilities.
            (4) Broader government-wide reform efforts and future 
        funding questions currently being addressed in Congress may 
        affect different trade promotion organizations to varying 
        degrees.
    (b) Report Required.--Therefore, in order to fully assess the 
organizational structure, capability, and spending levels of United 
States Government trade promotion organizations, the President, not 
later than March 1, 1996, shall submit to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations in the Senate and the Committee on International Relations in 
the House of Representatives, and to other appropriate committees of 
jurisdiction, a report detailing what steps are being taken to improve 
accessibility and coordination among all trade promotion organizations 
and agencies, what additional measures should be taken to further 
improve the efficiency of and reduce duplication among these 
organizations and agencies, and any suggested legislative actions that 
would further improve the Government's export and trade promotion 
activities.
    (c) Content of Report.--The report required by subsection (b) 
shall--
            (1) identify the name, number, function, and budget of all 
        Government organizations or agencies with some responsibility 
        for supporting, advancing, or promoting international trade or 
        United States exports;
            (2) assess the amount of exports directly generated by the 
        activities of each organization or agency;
            (3) describe the overall impact of the Government's trade 
        and export promotion programs on increasing exports and 
        overseas market share;
            (4) identify areas where increased cooperation and 
        interoperability would improve United States export promotion 
        efforts;
            (5) identify areas where greater efficiencies can be 
        achieved through the elimination of duplication among the 
        organizations and agencies included in paragraph (1);
            (6) identify ways to improve the audit and accountability 
        mechanisms for each organization or agency, with particular 
        emphasis or ensuring independent oversight capabilities for 
        each organization;
            (7) an assessment of the trade and export promotion 
        activities of the United States major trade partners and 
        competitors, including but not limited to amounts of tied aid 
        and export subsidization provided by the Governments of those 
        trade partners and competitors; and
            (8) a plan to reorganize the United States trade and export 
        promotion organizations and agencies, with legislative 
        requirements if necessary, in order to more efficiently promote 
        trade, increase organizational assessability, organize 
        bureaucratic effort, and expend public resources in support of 
        American exporters and international business.

SEC. 1706. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON REORGANIZATION 
              PLANS.

    (a) Limitation on Powers.--A reorganization plan under section 
1703, 1704, or 1705 may not have the effect of--
            (1) creating a new executive department;
            (2) continuing a function beyond the period authorized by 
        law for its exercise or beyond the time when it would have 
        terminated if the reorganization had not been made;
            (3) authorizing an agency to exercise a function which is 
        not authorized by law at the time the plan is transmitted to 
        Congress;
            (4) creating a new agency which is not a component or part 
        of an existing executive department or independent agency; or
            (5) increasing the term of an office beyond that provided 
        by law for the office.
    (b) Effect on Other Laws, Pending Legal Proceedings, and Unexpended 
Appropriations.--(1) A statute enacted, and a regulation or other 
action made, prescribed, issued, granted, or performed in respect of or 
by the agency or function affected by a reorganization under this 
title, before the effective date of the reorganization, has, except to 
the extent rescinded, modified, superseded, or made inapplicable by or 
under authority of law or by the abolition of a function, the same 
effect as if the reorganization had not been made. However, if the 
statute, regulation, or other action has vested the functions in a 
transferor agency, the function, insofar as it is to be exercised after 
the plan becomes effective, shall be deemed as vested in the transferee 
agency concerned.
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (1), the term ``regulation or 
other action'' means a regulation, rule, order, policy, determination, 
directive, authorization, permit, privilege, requirement, designation, 
or other action.

to be published in the Federal Register for each reorganization plan

terminated under the plan.

to Congress any other plan having the effect of revising such a plan, 
but before any resolution described in section 1708 has been ordered 
reported in (or deemed to be discharged from) either House of Congress, 
the President may make amendments or modifications to the plan, 
consistent with section 1703, 1704, or 1705, as the case may be, which 
modifications or revisions shall thereafter be treated as a part of the 
reorganization plan originally transmitted and shall not affect in any 
way the time limits otherwise provided for in section 1708. The 
President may withdraw the plan at any time prior to the conclusion of 
45 calendar days beginning on the date on which the plan is submitted 
to Congress.

SEC. 1708. PROCEDURES FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF REORGANIZATION

which is introduced in a House of Congress in accordance with 
subsection (c) shall be considered in Congress in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in this section.
    (b) Terms of Resolution.--For the purpose of subsection (a), the 
term ``resolution'' means only a joint resolution of the Congress, the 
matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: ``That the 
Congress approves the reorganization plan numbered ____ transmitted to 
the Congress by the President on ____________, 19____, pursuant to 
section ____ of the Foreign Affairs Reinvention Act of 1995.'', and 
includes such modifications and revisions as are submitted by the

appropriately. The term does not include a resolution which specifies 
more than one reorganization plan.
    (c) Introduction and Reference of Resolution.--(1) No later than 
the first day of session following the day on which a reorganization 
plan is transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate 
under section 1703, 1704, or 1705, or any other plan transmitted by the 
President to Congress having the effect of revising such a plan, a 
resolution, as defined in subsection (b), shall be introduced (by 
request) in the House by the chairman of the Committee on International 
Relations of the House of Representatives, or by a Member or Members of 
the House designated by such chairman, and shall be introduced (by 
request) in the Senate by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate, or by a Member or Members of the Senate 
designated by such chairman.
    (2) A resolution with respect to a reorganization plan shall be 
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives 
(and all resolutions with respect to the same plan shall be referred to 
the same committee) by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives, as the case may be. The committee shall 
make its recommendations to the House of Representatives or the Senate, 
as the case may be, within 30 calendar days following the date of such 
resolution's introduction.
    (d) Discharge of Committee Considering Resolution.--If the 
committee to which is referred a resolution introduced pursuant to 
paragraph (1) of subsection (c) (or, in the absence of such a 
resolution, the first resolution introduced with respect to the same 
reorganization plan) has not reported such resolution or identical 
resolution at the end of 30 calendar days after its introduction, such 
committee shall be deemed to be discharged from further consideration 
of such resolution and such resolution shall be placed on the 
appropriate calendar of the House involved.
    (e) Procedure After Report or Discharge of Committee; Debate; Vote 
on Final Passage.--(1) When the committee has reported, or has been 
deemed to be discharged (under subsection (d)) from further 
consideration of, a resolution with respect to a reorganization plan, 
it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to 
the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective 
House to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The 
motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. The motion shall not 
be subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or a motion to 
proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider 
the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be 
in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution 
is agreed to, the resolution shall remain the unfinished business of 
the respective House until disposed of.
    (2) Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable motions and 
appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than ten 
hours, which shall be divided
 equally between individuals favoring and individuals opposing the 
resolution. A motion further to limit debate is in order and not 
debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to 
proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit 
the resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by 
which the resolution is passed or rejected shall not be in order.
    (3) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the 
resolution with respect to a reorganization plan, and a single quorum 
call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with 
the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the 
resolution shall occur.
    (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, 
as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution with 
respect to a reorganization plan shall be decided without debate.
    (5) If, prior to the passage by one House of a resolution of that 
House, that House receives a resolution with respect to the same 
reorganization plan from the other House, then--
            (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no 
        resolution had been received from the other House; but
            (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of 
        the other House.
    (f) Rules of Senate and House of Representatives on Reorganization 
Plans.--Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section are enacted 
by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such 
        they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, 
        respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure 
        to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions with 
        respect to any reorganization plans transmitted to Congress in 
        accordance with section 1703, 1704, or 1705, or any other plan 
        transmitted by the President to Congress having the effect of 
        revising such a plan, and they supersede other rules only to 
        the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to 
        the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.
