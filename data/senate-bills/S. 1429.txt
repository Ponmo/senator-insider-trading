SEC. 1314. TREATMENT OF GAIN FROM CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP TRANSACTIONS.

    (a) In General.--Part IV of subchapter P of chapter 1 (relating to 
special rules for determining capital gains and losses) is amended by 
inserting after section 1259 the following new section:

``SEC. 1260. GAINS FROM CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP TRANSACTIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--If the taxpayer has gain from a constructive 
ownership transaction with respect to any financial asset and such gain 
would (without regard to this section) be treated as a long-term 
capital gain--
            ``(1) such gain shall be treated as ordinary income to the 
        extent that such gain exceeds the net underlying long-term 
        capital gain, and
            ``(2) to the extent such gain is treated as a long-term 
        capital gain after the application of paragraph (1), the 
        determination of the capital gain rate (or rates) applicable to 
        such gain under section 1(h) shall be determined on the basis 
        of the respective rate (or rates) that would have been 
        applicable to the net underlying long-term capital gain.
    ``(b) Interest Charge on Deferral of Gain Recognition.--
            ``(1) In general.--If any gain is treated as ordinary 
        income for any taxable year by reason of subsection (a)(1), the 
        tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year shall be 
        increased by the amount of interest determined under paragraph 
        (2) with respect to each prior taxable year during any portion 
        of which the constructive ownership transaction was open. Any 
        amount payable under this paragraph shall be taken into account 
        in computing the amount of any deduction allowable to the 
        taxpayer for interest paid or accrued during such taxable year.
            ``(2) Amount of interest.--The amount of interest 
        determined under this paragraph with respect to a prior taxable 
        year is the amount of interest which would have been imposed 
        under section 6601 on the underpayment of tax for such year 
        which would have resulted if the gain (which is treated as 
        ordinary income by reason of subsection (a)(1)) had been 
        included in gross income in the taxable years in which it 
        accrued (determined by treating the income as accruing at a 
        constant rate equal to the applicable Federal rate as in effect 
        on the day the transaction closed). The period during which 
        such interest shall accrue shall end on the due date (without 
        extensions) for the return of tax imposed by this chapter for 
        the taxable year in which such transaction closed.
            ``(3) Applicable federal rate.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (2), the applicable Federal rate is the applicable Federal rate 
        determined under 1274(d) (compounded semiannually) which would 
        apply to a debt instrument with a term equal to the period the 
        transaction was open.
            ``(4) No credits against increase in tax.--Any increase in 
        tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as tax imposed by 
        this chapter for purposes of determining--
                    ``(A) the amount of any credit allowable under this 
                chapter, or
                    ``(B) the amount of the tax imposed by section 55.

                        not a pass-thru entity.
            ``(2) Pass-thru entity.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        term `pass-thru entity' means--

    ``(d) Constructive Ownership Transaction.--For purposes of this 
section--
            ``(1) In general.--The taxpayer shall be treated as having 
        entered into a constructive ownership transaction with respect 
        to any financial asset if the taxpayer--

                principal contract with respect to the financial asset,

                acquire the financial asset,

                grantor of a put option, with respect to the financial

                prices and substantially contemporaneous maturity 
                dates, or

                prescribed by the Secretary, enters into 1 or more 
                other transactions (or acquires 1 or more positions) 
                that have substantially the same effect as a 
                transaction described in any of the preceding 
                subparagraphs.
            ``(2) Exception for positions which are marked to market.--
        This section shall not apply to any constructive ownership 
        transaction if all of the positions which are part of such 
        transaction are marked to market under any provision of this 
        title or the regulations thereunder.
            ``(3) Long position under notional principal contract.--A 
        person shall be treated as holding a long position under a

        if such person--
                    ``(A) has the right to be paid (or receive credit 
                for) all or substantially all of the investment yield

                for) all or substantially all of any decline in the 
                value of such financial asset.

        any contract to acquire in the future (or provide or receive 
        credit for the future value of) any financial asset.
    ``(e) Net Underlying Long-Term Capital Gain.--For purposes of this 
section, in the case of any constructive ownership transaction with 
respect to any financial asset, the term `net underlying long-term 
capital gain' means the aggregate net capital gain that the taxpayer 
would have had if--
            ``(1) the financial asset had been acquired for fair market 
        value on the date such transaction was opened and sold for fair 
        market value on the date such transaction was closed, and
            ``(2) only gains and losses that would have resulted from 
        the deemed ownership under paragraph (1) were taken into

any financial asset shall be treated as zero unless the amount thereof 
is established by clear and convincing evidence.
    ``(f) Special Rule Where Taxpayer Takes Delivery.--Except as 
provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if a constructive 
ownership transaction is closed by reason of taking delivery, this 
section shall be applied as if the taxpayer had sold all the contracts, 
options, or other positions which are part of such transaction for fair 
market value on the closing date. The amount of gain recognized under 
the preceding sentence shall not exceed the amount of gain treated as 
ordinary income under subsection (a). Proper adjustments shall be made 
in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain 
recognized and treated as ordinary income under this subsection.
    ``(g) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations 
as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this 
section, including regulations--

        convey substantially all of the economic return with respect to 
        a financial asset.''

subchapter P of chapter 1 is amended by adding at the end the following 
new item:

        (1), if a corporation acquires (other than in a distribution 
        from a partnership) stock the basis of which is determined in 
        whole or in part by reference to subsection (a)(2) or (b), the 
        corporation shall be treated as receiving a distribution of 
        such stock from a partnership.

        the property held by a distributed corporation is stock in a 
        corporation which the distributed corporation controls, this 
        subsection shall be applied to reduce the basis of the property 
        of such controlled corporation. This subsection shall be 
        reapplied to any property of any controlled corporation which 
        is stock in a corporation which it controls.

        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of 
        this subsection, including regulations to avoid double counting 
        and to prevent the abuse of such purposes.''
