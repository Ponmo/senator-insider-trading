                     TITLE II_BUDGETARY PROCEDURES

SEC. 21. SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.

    (a) Sense of the Congress._It is the sense of the Congress that_
        (1) from time to time the United States Government should sell 
    assets; and
        (2) the amounts realized from such asset sales will not recur 
    on an annual basis and do not reduce the demand for credit.
    (b) Budgetary Treatment._For purposes of points of order under this 
concurrent resolution and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 
Control Act of 1974, the amounts realized from sales of assets (other 
than loan assets) shall not be scored with respect to the level of 
budget authority, outlays, or revenues.
    (c) Definitions._For purposes of this section_
        (1) the term ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning 
    as under section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
    Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as amended by the Budget Enforcement 
    Act of 1990); and
        (2) the term shall not include asset sales mandated by law 
    before September 18, 1987, and routine, ongoing asset sales at 
    levels consistent with agency operations in fiscal year 1986.
    (d) Sunset._Subsections (a) through (c) of this section shall 
expire September 30, 1998.
    (e) Conforming Amendment._Section 8 of House Concurrent Resolution 
64 (103d Congress), section 8 of House Concurrent Resolution 287 (102d 
Congress), section 7 of House Concurrent Resolution 121 (102d 
Congress), section 5 of House Concurrent Resolution 310 (101st 
Congress), section 6 of House Concurrent Resolution 106 (101st 
Congress), section 4 of House Concurrent Resolution 268 (100th

any concurrent resolution on the budget for any fiscal year (as 
reported and as amended), amendments thereto, or any conference report 
thereon.
    (b) Conforming Amendment._Section 10(b) of House Concurrent 
Resolution 64 (103d Congress) and section 12(b) of House Concurrent 
Resolution 287 (102d Congress) are repealed.

    (a) Purpose._The Senate declares that it is essential to_
        (1) ensure continued compliance with the deficit reduction 
    embodied in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; and
        (2) continue the pay-as-you-go enforcement system.
    (b) Point of Order._
        (1) In general._It shall not be in order in the Senate to 
    consider any direct-spending or receipts legislation (as defined in 
    paragraph (3)) that would increase the deficit for any one of the 
    three applicable time periods (as defined in paragraph (2)) as 
    measured pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5).
        (2) Applicable time periods._For purposes of this subsection, 
    the term ``applicable time period'' means any one of the three 
    following periods_
            (A) the first fiscal year covered by the most recently 
        adopted concurrent resolution on the budget;
            (B) the period of the 5 fiscal years covered by the most 
        recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; or
            (C) the period of the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 
        years covered by the most recently adopted concurrent 
        resolution on the budget.
        (3) Direct-spending or receipts legislation._For purposes of 
    this subsection, the term ``direct-spending or receipts 
    legislation'' shall_
            (A) include any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, 
        or conference report to which this subsection otherwise 
        applies;
            (B) exclude concurrent resolutions on the budget;
            (C) exclude full funding of, and continuation of, the 
        deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of 
        enactment of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990;
            (D) exclude emergency provisions so designated under 
        section 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985;
            (E) include the estimated amount of savings in direct-
        spending programs applicable to that fiscal year resulting from 
        the prior year's sequestration under the Balanced Budget and 
        Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, if any (except for any 
        amounts sequestered as a result of a net deficit increase in 
        the fiscal year immediately preceding the prior fiscal year); 
        and
            (F) except as otherwise provided in this subsection, 
        include all direct-spending legislation as that term is 
        interpreted for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
        Deficit Control Act of 1985.
        (4) Baseline._Estimates prepared pursuant to this section shall 
    use the baseline used for the most recent concurrent resolution on 
    the budget, and for years beyond those covered by that concurrent 
    resolution, shall abide by the requirements of section 257 of the 
    Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, except 
    that references to ``outyears'' in that section shall be deemed to 
    apply to any year (other than the budget year) covered by any one 
    of the time periods defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
        (5) Prior surplus available._If direct-spending or receipts 
    legislation increases the deficit when taken individually (as a 
    bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, as 
    the case may be), then it must also increase the deficit when taken 
    together with all direct-spending and receipts legislation enacted 
    after the date of enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
    Act of 1993, in order to violate the prohibition of this 
    subsection.
    (c) Waiver._This section may be waived or suspended in the Senate 
only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly 
chosen and sworn.
    (d) Appeals._Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of the Chair 
relating to any provision of this section shall be limited to 1 hour, 
to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the appellant and the 
manager of the bill or joint resolution, as the case may be. An 
affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly 
chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain an appeal 
of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this 
section.
    (e) Determination of Budget Levels._For purposes of this section, 
the levels of new budget authority, outlays, and receipts for a fiscal 
year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the 
Committee on the Budget of the Senate.
    (f) Conforming Amendment._Section 12 of House Concurrent Resolution 
64 (103d Congress) is repealed.
    (g) Technical Correction._Notwithstanding section 275(b) of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as amended 
by sections 13112(b) and 13208(b)(3) of the Budget Enforcement Act of 
1990), the second sentence of section 904(c) of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 (except insofar as it relates to section 313 of that 
Act) and the final sentence of section 904(d) of that Act (except 
insofar as it relates to section 313 of that Act) shall continue to

    that recommends discretionary spending levels for the first fiscal 
    year covered by that resolution that would exceed the discretionary 
    spending limits as reduced in this section.

    at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the 
    case of any other rule of that House.

                 TITLE III_SENSE OF CONGRESS PROVISIONS

  SEC. 31. CONTROLLING GROWTH OF ENTITLEMENT OR MANDATORY SPENDING.
    It is the sense of the Congress that legislation should be enacted 
providing enforceable limits to control the growth of entitlement or 
mandatory spending.
  SEC. 32. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING ENACTMENT OF CERTAIN BUDGET 
      PROCESS LEGISLATION.
    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the following 
legislation should be enacted:
        (1) Legislation providing enforceable limits to control the 
    growth of entitlement or mandatory spending.
        (2) Amendments to the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 to 
    establish a regular procedure to provide assistance for disasters 
    and other emergencies without adding to the deficit.
        (3) Legislation granting the President expedited rescission 
    authority over appropriations measures, as provided by H.R. 1578, 
    as passed the House.
  SEC. 33. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CONTROLLING NON-SOCIAL SECURITY 
      MANDATORY SPENDING.
    It is the sense of the Senate that the Congress should_
        (1) after enacting health care reform legislation, enact annual 
    caps to control the growth of entitlement or mandatory spending;
        (2) include within these caps all mandatory spending programs 
    except Social Security, deposit insurance, and net interest;
        (3) provide that these caps shall be set so that programs 
    providing benefits to individuals may grow for inflation, changes 
    in the numbers of beneficiaries, and an additional growth 
    allowance;
        (4) provide that these caps shall be adjusted annually in the 
    President's budget for changes in inflation and the number of 
    beneficiaries since Congress enacted the caps (excluding any 
    changes due to legislation);
        (5) provide an enforcement mechanism in the event that total 
    mandatory spending exceeds the caps; and
        (6) enact caps on tax expenditures similar to those for 
    mandatory spending so as to ensure that reductions in Federal 
    spending for mandatory programs are not achieved by shifting 
    spending to tax expenditures.
  SEC. 34. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING OF 
      HEALTH CARE REFORM.
    It is the sense of the Congress that_
        (1) the Congress should measure the costs and benefits of all 
    health care reform legislation against a uniform set of economic 
    and technical assumptions;
        (2) before enacting major changes in the health care system, 
    the Congress should have available to it reliable estimates of the 
    costs of competing plans prepared in a comparable manner; and
        (3) the Congress should account for all financial transactions 
    associated with Federal health care reform legislation.
  SEC. 35. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON THE COSTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
    (a) Findings._The Congress finds that_
        (1) the Federal Government is solely responsible for setting 
    and enforcing national immigration policy;
        (2) the Federal Government has not adequately enforced 
    immigration laws;
        (3) this weak enforcement has imposed financial costs on State 
    and local governments;
        (4) the Federal Government has failed to investigate and 
    prosecute Federal wage and hour violations, thus creating 
    incentives to hire persons illegally in the United States and 
    exacerbating the problem of illegal immigration;
        (5) States must incur costs for incarcerating undocumented 
    persons convicted of State and local crimes, educating undocumented 
    children, providing emergency medical services to undocumented 
    persons, and providing services incidental to admission of refugees 
    under the Refugee Admissions and Resettlement Program; and
        (6) the Federal Government has an obligation to reimburse State 
    and local governments for costs resulting from the costs described 
    in this subsection.
    (b) Sense of Congress._It is the sense of the Congress that, in 
setting forth the budget authority and outlay amounts in this 
resolution, the Congress intends that funding should be provided to 
reimburse State and local governments for the costs associated with_
        (1) elementary and secondary education for undocumented 
    children;
        (2) emergency medical assistance to undocumented persons;
        (3) incarceration and parole of criminal aliens; and
        (4) services incidental to admission of refugees under the 
    Refugee Admissions and Resettlement Program.

SEC. 36. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING BASELINES.

    (a) Findings._The Congress finds that_
        (1) the baseline budget shows the likely course of Federal 
    revenues and spending if policies remain unchanged;
        (2) baseline budgeting has given rise to the practice of 
    calculating policy changes from an inflated spending level; and
        (3) the baseline concept has been misused to portray policies 
    that would simply slow down the increase in spending as spending 
    reductions.
    (b) Sense of Congress._It is the sense of the Congress that_
        (1) the President should submit a budget that compares proposed 
    spending levels for the budget year with the current year; and
        (2) the starting point for deliberations on a budget resolution 
    should be the current year.
  SEC. 37. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING UNFUNDED FEDERAL MANDATES.
    It is the sense of the Congress that_
        (1) the Federal Government should not shift the costs of 
    administering Federal programs to State and local governments;
        (2) the Federal Government's share of entitlement programs 
    should not be capped or otherwise decreased without providing 
    States authority to amend their financial or programmatic 
    responsibilities to continue meeting the mandated service; and
        (3) Congress should develop a mechanism to ensure that costs of 
    mandates are considered during agencies' development of regulations 
    and congressional deliberations on legislation.

SEC. 38. CLOSING OF LOOPHOLES IN FOREIGN TAX PROVISIONS.

    (a) Findings._The Senate finds that_
        (1) there is evidence suggesting that foreign-controlled 
    corporations doing business in the United States do not pay their 
    fair share of taxes;
        (2) over 70 percent of foreign-controlled corporations doing 
    business in the United States pay no Federal income tax;
        (3) the United States Department of the Treasury has limited 
    its ability to protect the revenue base in the case of cross-border 
    transactions, to the detriment of taxpayers engaged solely in 
    domestic transactions;
        (4) the Department of the Treasury has been using antiquated 
    accounting concepts to deal with sophisticated multinational 
    corporations;
        (5) substantial Federal revenues are lost annually due to the 
    inability of the Internal Revenue Service to enforce the ``arm's 
    length'' transaction rule, along with substantial amounts spent on 
    administration and litigation; and
        (6) the Federal income tax laws provide a financial incentive 
    for domestic taxpayers to operate abroad by granting them deferral 
    of United States taxes on income earned abroad.
    (b) Sense of the Senate._It is the sense of the Senate that deficit 
reduction should be achieved, in part, by ending loopholes and 
enforcement breakdowns that now foster the underpayment of taxes on 
income from cross-border transactions and that subsidize the flight of 
domestic businesses and jobs out of the United States, by means 
including_
        (1) the adoption of a more streamlined and efficient method of 
    enforcing Federal tax laws involving multinational corporations, 
    especially those based abroad, and in particular, the use by the 
    Treasury Department of a formulaic approach in cases in which the 
    current ``arm's length'' transaction rules do not work; and
        (2) a repeal of tax subsidies for domestic businesses that 
    operate abroad in tax havens and then ship their products back into 
    the United States.

SEC. 39. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX EXPENDITURES.

    (a) Findings._The Senate finds that tax expenditures_
        (1) are growing significantly;
        (2) may have the same effect as direct Federal spending; and
        (3) should be subject to the same level of budgetary review as 
    direct spending.
    (b) Sense of the Senate._It is the sense of the Senate that_
        (1) the Congress should consider targets for the growth in tax 
    expenditures similar to the targets for the growth of mandatory 
    spending;
        (2) any reconciliation instructions included in a budget 
    resolution should specify these targets; and
        (3) such targets should be enforceable separately from any 
    revenue targets included in the reconciliation instructions.
  SEC. 40. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY AND 
      WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE.
    It is the sense of the Congress that_
        (1) sufficient funding should be provided to the Indian Health 
    Service to ensure that Indian Health Service hospitals and 
    outpatient facilities in existence on the date of enactment of this 
    resolution, and Indian Health Service hospitals and outpatient 
    facilities scheduled to open during fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 
    1996, are fully staffed with the appropriate number of health care 
    professionals needed to meet the health and medical needs of the 
    American Indians and Alaska Natives who depend on the Indian Health 
    Service for health care; and
        (2) sufficient funding should be provided to the Indian Health 
    Service to ensure that the Indian Health Service is capable of 
    meeting basic public health and safety and sanitation requirements 
    on Indian lands through timely and proper water infrastructure 
    construction and upgrades.
  SEC. 41. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND 
      SPACE ADMINISTRATION.
    It is the sense of the Senate that the budget authority and outlay 
figures for function 250 in this resolution do not assume any amounts 
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for any fiscal 
year from 1995 through 1999 in excess of the amounts proposed by the 
President for such fiscal year.

SEC. 42. MINIMUM ALLOCATION PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings._The Senate finds that_
        (1) the minimum allocation program was established in 1982 to 
    address inequities in the funding formula for Federal-aid highways;
        (2) the minimum allocation program was designed to provide the 
    greatest degree of flexibility practicable to States that receive 
    funding under the formula referred to in paragraph (1) and includes 
    an exemption of the apportionments from the obligation ceiling;
        (3) the minimum allocation program provides additional 
    flexibility by allowing a State a 4-year period during which 
    amounts apportioned to the State may be obligated;
        (4) the budget of the United States Government for fiscal year 
    1995 submitted by the President to Congress proposes to include 
    minimum allocation apportionments under the obligation ceiling and 
    also proposes to limit the authority of States to obligate 
    apportionments under the minimum allocation program to 67 percent 
    of the amount of the apportionments; and
        (5) States have planned transportation programs on the basis of 
    the provisions of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency 
    Act of 1991, and the amendments made by the Act, relating to 
    minimum allocation that confirmed core commitments to exemption and 
    flexibility.
    (b) Sense of the Senate._It is the sense of the Senate that_
        (1) the minimum allocation program should remain exempt from 
    the obligation ceiling; and
        (2) the flexibility of the minimum allocation program should be 
    an enduring and critical component of the provision of Federal 
    assistance to States for Federal-aid highways.
    (c) Definitions._As used in this section:
        (1) Federal-aid highways._The term ``Federal-aid highways'' has 
    the meaning provided the term in section 101 of title 23, United 
    States Code.
        (2) Minimum allocation program._The term ``minimum allocation 
    program'' means the program of allocation of funding to States 
    under section 157 of title 23, United States Code.
        (3) Obligation ceiling._The term ``obligation ceiling'' means 
    the obligation ceiling under section 1002 of the Intermodal Surface 
    Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.

SEC. 43. POLICY IN EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE.

    It is the sense of the Congress that levels of spending set forth 
in this resolution regarding the International Affairs (150) budget 
category include an assumption that the United States will oppose, 
consistent with provisions contained in the Freedom Support Act and the 
Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act of 1994, attempts by the Russian 
Federation to intimidate, use military force or engage in economic 
coercion to establish a sphere of influence over the former republics 
of the Soviet Union, the Baltics, or Central and Eastern European 
nations.

SEC. 44. STAR WARS (BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE).

    It is the sense of the Senate that given the Federal budget 
deficit, the real reductions in discretionary spending in this 
resolution, and the existence of many more worthy programs competing 
for this funding, spending for the Star Wars (Ballistic Missile 
Defense) must not exceed the fiscal year 1994 appropriated level.
