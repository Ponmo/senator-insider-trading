              TITLE II--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT AND RULEMAKING
                     Subtitle A--Budget Enforcement

SEC. 201. LOCK-BOX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
        (1) under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the Social 
    Security trust funds are off-budget for purposes of the President's 
    budget submission and the concurrent resolution on the budget;
        (2) the Social Security trust funds have been running surpluses 
    for 17 years;
        (3) these surpluses have been used to implicitly finance the 
    general operations of the Federal Government;
        (4) in fiscal year 2001, the Social Security surplus will be 
    $166 billion;
        (5) this resolution balances the Federal budget without 
    counting the Social Security surpluses;
        (6) the only way to ensure that Social Security surpluses are 
    not diverted for other purposes is to balance the budget exclusive 
    of such surpluses; and
        (7) the Congress and the President should take such steps as 
    are necessary to ensure that future budgets are balanced excluding 
    the surpluses generated by the Social Security trust funds.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
legislation should be enacted in this session of Congress that would 
enforce the reduction in debt held by the public assumed in this 
resolution by the imposition of a statutory limit on such debt or other 
appropriate means.
    (c) Point of Order.--
        (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the House of 
    Representatives or the Senate to consider any revision to this 
    resolution or a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 
    2002, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that 
    sets forth a deficit for any fiscal year.
        (2) Deficit levels.--For purposes of this subsection, a deficit 
    shall be the level (if any) set forth in the most recently agreed 
    to concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal year 
    pursuant to section 301(a)(3) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
    1974.
    (d) Exception.--Subsection (c)(1) shall not apply if--
        (1) the most recent of the Department of Commerce's advance, 
    preliminary, or final reports of actual real economic growth 
    indicate that the rate of real economic growth for each of the most 
    recently reported quarter and the immediately preceding quarter is 
    less than 1 percent; or
        (2) a declaration of war is in effect.
    (e) Social Security Look-Back.--If in fiscal year 2001 the Social 
Security surplus is used to finance general operations of the Federal 
Government, an amount equal to the amount used shall be deducted from 
the available amount of discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 for 
purposes of any concurrent resolution on the budget.
    (f) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (c)(1) may be waived or 
suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths 
of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required 
in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a 
point of order raised under this section.

SEC. 202. DEBT REDUCTION LOCK-BOX.

    (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House of 
Representatives to consider any reported bill or joint resolution, or 
any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that would cause a 
surplus for fiscal year 2001 to be less than the level (as adjusted) 
set forth in section 101(4) for that fiscal year.
    (b) Special Rule.--The level of the surplus for purposes of 
subsection (a) shall take into account amounts adjusted under section 
314(a)(2)(B) or (C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

    (a) Prohibition on Use of Directed Scorekeeping.--(1) It shall not 
be in order in the House to consider any reported bill or joint 
resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that 
contains a directed scorekeeping provision.
    (2) As used in this subsection, the term ``directed scorekeeping'' 
means directing the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of 
Management and Budget how to estimate any provision providing 
discretionary new budget authority in a bill or joint resolution making 
general appropriations for a fiscal year for budgetary enforcement 
purposes.
    (b) Prohibition on Use of Advance Appropriations.--(1) It shall not 
be in order in the House to consider any reported bill or joint 
resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that 
would cause the total level of discretionary advance appropriations 
provided for fiscal years after 2001 to exceed $23,500,000,000 (which 
represents the total level of advance appropriations for fiscal year 
2001).
    (2) As used in this subsection, the term ``advance appropriation'' 
means any discretionary new budget authority in a bill or joint 
resolution making general appropriations for fiscal year 2001 that 
first becomes available for any fiscal year after 2001.
    (c) Effective Date.--This section shall cease to have any force or 
effect on January 1, 2001.

year'' means with respect to a session of Congress, the fiscal year of 
the Government that starts on October 1 of the calendar year in which 
that session begins.
    (b) Point of Order With Respect to Advance Appropriations.--
        (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to 
    consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or conference 
    report that--
            (A) provides an appropriation of new budget authority for 
        any fiscal year after the budget year that is in excess of the 
        amounts provided in paragraph (2); and
            (B) provides an appropriation of new budget authority for 
        any fiscal year subsequent to the year after the budget year.
        (2) Limitation on amounts.--The total amount, provided in 
    appropriations legislation for the budget year, of appropriations 
    for the subsequent fiscal year shall not exceed $23,500,000,000.
    (c) Point of Order With Respect to Delayed Obligations.--
        (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall 
    not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, 
    amendment, motion, or conference report that contains an 
    appropriation of new budget authority for any fiscal year which 
    does not become available upon enactment of such legislation or on 
    the first day of that fiscal year (whichever is later).
        (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to 
    appropriations in the defense category; nor shall it apply to 
    appropriations reoccurring or customary.
    (d) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsections (b) and (c) may be waived or 
suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths

in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a 
point of order raised under this section.

1974.
    (g) Precatory Amendments.--For purposes of interpreting section 
305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, an amendment is not 
germane if it contains predominately precatory language.
    (h) Additional Instruction.--The chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget in the Senate may instruct the Senate Committee on Finance to 
report legislation to reduce debt held by the public in an amount 
consistent with section 103.

SEC. 205. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION POINT OF ORDER IN THE SENATE.

    (a) Designations.--
        (1) Guidance.--In making a designation of a provision of 
    legislation as an emergency requirement under section 251(b)(2)(A) 
    or 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
    of 1985, the committee report and any statement of managers 
    accompanying that legislation shall analyze whether a proposed 
    emergency requirement meets all the criteria in paragraph (2).
        (2) Criteria.--
            (A) In general.--The criteria to be considered in 
        determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is an 
        emergency requirement are--
                (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful 
            or beneficial);
                (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not 
            building up over time;
                (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need 
            requiring immediate action;
                (iv) subject to subparagraph (B), unforeseen, 
            unpredictable, and unanticipated; and
                (v) not permanent, temporary in nature.
            (B) Unforeseen.--An emergency that is part of an aggregate 
        level of anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally 
        estimated in advance, is not unforeseen.
        (3) Justification for failure to meet criteria.--If the 
    proposed emergency requirement does not meet all the criteria set 
    forth in paragraph (2), the committee report or the statement of 
    managers, as the case may be, shall provide a written justification 
    of why the requirement should be accorded emergency status.
    (b) Point of Order.--When the Senate is considering a bill, 
resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, a point of order 
may be made by a Senator against an emergency designation in that 
measure and if the Presiding Officer sustains that point of order, that 
provision making such a designation shall be stricken from the measure 
and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor.
    (c) Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be waived or suspended in 
the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, 
duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the 
Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of 
order raised under this section.
    (d) Definition of an Emergency Requirement.--A provision shall be 
considered an emergency designation if it designates any item an 
emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
    (e) Form of the Point of Order.--A point of order under this 
section may be raised by a Senator as provided in section 313(e) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
    (f) Conference Reports.--If a point of order is sustained under 
this section against a conference report, the report shall be disposed 
of as provided in section 313(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974.
    (g) Exception for Defense Spending.--Subsection (b) shall not apply 
against an emergency designation for a provision making discretionary 
appropriations in the defense category.

SEC. 206. MECHANISM FOR IMPLEMENTING INCREASE OF FISCAL YEAR 2001 
              DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
        (1) Unless and until the discretionary spending limit for 
    fiscal year 2001 is increased, aggregate appropriations which 
    exceed the current law limits would still be out of order in the 
    Senate and subject to a supermajority vote.
        (2) The functional totals contained in this concurrent 
    resolution envision a level of discretionary spending for fiscal 
    year 2001 as follows:
            (A) For the discretionary category: $600,296,000,000 in new 
        budget authority and $592,773,000,000 in outlays.
            (B) For the highway category: $26,920,000,000 in outlays.
            (C) For the mass transit category: $4,639,000,000 in 
        outlays.
        (3) To facilitate the Senate completing its legislative 
    responsibilities for the 106th Congress in a timely fashion, it is 
    imperative that the Senate consider legislation which increases the 
    discretionary spending limit for fiscal year 2001 as soon as 
    possible.
    (b) Adjustment to Allocations and Other Budgetary Aggregates and 
Levels.--Whenever a bill or joint resolution becomes law that increases 
the discretionary spending limit for fiscal year 2001 set out in 
section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House or 
Senate, as applicable, shall increase the allocation called for in 
section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the 
appropriate Committee on Appropriations and shall also appropriately 
adjust all other budgetary aggregates and levels contained in this 
resolution.
    (c) Limitation on Adjustment.--An adjustment made pursuant to 
subsection (b) shall not result in an allocation under section 302(a) 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that exceeds the total budget 
authority and outlays set forth in subsection (a)(2).

SEC. 207. SENATE FIREWALL FOR DEFENSE AND NONDEFENSE SPENDING.

    (a) Definition.--In this section, for purposes of enforcement in 
the Senate for fiscal year 2001, the term ``discretionary spending 
limit'' means--
        (1) for the defense category, $310,819,000,000 in new budget 
    authority and $297,650,000,000 in outlays; and
        (2) for the nondefense category, $289,477,000,000 in new budget 
    authority and $327,430,000,000 in outlays.
    (b) Point of Order in the Senate.--
        (1) In general.--After the adjustment to the section 302(a) 
    allocation to the Committee on Appropriations is made pursuant to 
    section 213 and except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall not 
    be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, 
    amendment, motion, or conference report that exceeds any 
    discretionary spending limit set forth in this section.
        (2) Exception.--This subsection shall not apply if a 
    declaration of war by Congress is in effect.
    (c) Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be waived or suspended in 
the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, 
duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the 
Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of 
order raised under this section.

SEC. 211. MECHANISM FOR ADDITIONAL DEBT REDUCTION.

    (a) In General.--If any of the legislation described in subsection 
(b) is vetoed (or does not become law) or any legislation described in 
subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) does not become law on or before October 1, 
2000, then the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House or 
Senate, as applicable, may adjust the levels in this concurrent 
resolution as provided in subsection (c).
    (b) Legislation.--Any adjustment pursuant to subsection (a) shall 
be made with respect to--
        (1) the reconciliation legislation required by section 103(a) 
    or section 104;
        (2) the Medicare legislation provided for in section 214 or 
    215; or
        (3) any legislation which reduces revenues and is vetoed.
    (c) Adjustments To Be Made.--The adjustment pursuant to subsection 
(a) shall be--
        (1) with respect to the legislation required by section 103(a) 
    or section 104, to decrease the balance displayed on the Senate's 
    pay-as-you-go scorecard and increase the revenue aggregate by the 
    amount set forth in section 103(a) or section 104 (as adjusted, if 
    adjusted, pursuant to section 213) less the amount of any reduction 
    in the current level of revenues which has occurred since the 
    adoption of this concurrent resolution and to decrease the level of 
    debt held by the public as set forth in section 101(6) by that same 
    amount;
        (2) with respect to the legislation provided for in section 214 
    or section 215, to decrease the balance displayed on the Senate's 
    pay-as-you-go scorecard by the amount set forth in section 214 or

     TITLE III--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS, HOUSE, AND SENATE PROVISIONS
              Subtitle A--Sense of the Congress Provisions

SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION.

    It is the sense of the Congress that funding for graduate medical 
education for children's hospitals is a high priority in this 
resolution.

SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO THE 
              CLASSROOM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
        (1) strengthening America's public schools while respecting 
    State and local control is critically important to the future of 
    our children and our Nation;
        (2) education is a local responsibility, a State priority, and 
    a national concern;
        (3) a partnership with the Nation's governors, parents, 
    teachers, and principals must take place in order to strengthen 
    public schools and foster educational excellence;
        (4) the consolidation of various Federal education programs 
    will benefit our Nation's children, parents, and teachers by 
    sending more dollars directly to the classroom; and
        (5) our Nation's children deserve an educational system that 
    will provide opportunities to excel.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
        (1) Congress should enact legislation that would consolidate 31 
    Federal K-12 education programs; and
        (2) the Department of Education, the States, and local 
    educational agencies should work together to ensure that not less 
    than 95 percent of all funds appropriated for the purpose of 
    carrying out elementary and secondary education programs 
    administered by the Department of Education are spent for our 
    children in their classrooms.

               Subtitle B--Sense of the House Provisions

SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds that--
        (1) while the budget may be in balance, it continues to be 
    ridden with waste, fraud, and abuse;
        (2) just last month, auditors documented more than 
    $19,000,000,000 in improper payments each year by such agencies as 
    the Agency of International Development, the Internal Revenue 
    Service, the Social Security Administration, and the Department of 
    Defense;
        (3) the General Accounting Office recently reported that the 
    financial management practices of some Federal agencies are so poor 
    that it is unable to determine the full extent of improper 
    Government payments; and
        (4) the General Accounting Office now lists a record number of 
    25 Federal programs that are at ``high risk'' of waste, fraud, and 
    abuse.
    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that the 
Committee on the Budget has created task forces to address this issue 
and that the President should take immediate steps to reduce waste, 
fraud, and abuse within the Federal Government and report on such 
actions to Congress and that any resulting savings should be dedicated 
to debt reduction and tax relief.

SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING EMERGENCY SPENDING.

    It is the sense of the House that, as part of a comprehensive 
reform of the budget process, the Committees on the Budget should 
develop a definition of, and a process for, funding emergencies 
consistent with the applicable provisions of H.R. 853, the 
Comprehensive Budget Process Reform Act of 1999, that could be 
incorporated into the Rules of the House of Representatives and the 
Standing Rules of the Senate.

SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF REGULATIONS 
              ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds that--
        (1) the Federal regulatory system sometimes adversely affects 
    many Americans and businesses by imposing financial burdens with 
    little corresponding public benefit;
        (2) currently, Congress has no general mechanism for assessing 
    the financial impact of regulatory activities on the private 
    sector;
        (3) Congress is ultimately responsible for making sure agencies 
    act in accordance with congressional intent and, while the 
    executive branch is responsible for promulgating regulations, 
    Congress should curb ineffective regulations by using its oversight 
    and regulatory powers; and
        (4) a variety of reforms have been suggested to increase 
    congressional oversight over regulatory activity, including 
    directing the President to prepare an annual accounting statement 
    containing several cost/benefit analyses, recommendations to reform 
    inefficient regulatory programs, and an identification and analysis 
    of duplications and inconsistencies among such programs.
    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that the 
House should reclaim its role as reformer and take the first step 
toward curbing inefficient regulatory activity by passing legislation 
authorizing the Congressional Budget Office to prepare regular 
estimates on the impact of proposed Federal regulations on the private 
sector.

SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON BIENNIAL BUDGETING.

    It is the sense of the House that there is a wide range of views on 
the advisability of biennial budgeting and this issue should be 
considered only within the context of comprehensive budget process 
reform.

SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND 
              PRESERVING HOME HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL MEDICARE 
              BENEFICIARIES.

    (a) Access to Health Insurance.--
        (1) Findings.--The House finds that--
            (A) 44.4 million Americans are currently without health 
        insurance, and that this number is expected to rise to nearly 
        60 million people in the next 10 years;
            (B) the cost of health insurance continues to rise, a key 
        factor in increasing the number of uninsured; and
            (C) there is a consensus that working Americans and their 
        families will suffer from reduced access to health insurance.
        (2) Sense of the house on improving access to health care 
    insurance.--It is the sense of the House that access to affordable 
    health care coverage for all Americans is a priority of the 106th 
    Congress.
    (b) Preserving Home Health Service For All Medicare 
Beneficiaries.--
        (1) Findings.--The House finds that--
            (A) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reformed Medicare home 
        health care spending by instructing the Health Care Financing 
        Administration to implement a prospective payment system and 
        instituted an interim payment system to achieve savings;
            (B) the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget 
        Refinement Act, 1999, reformed the interim payment system to 
        increase reimbursements to low-cost providers and delayed the 
        automatic 15 percent payment reduction until after the first 
        year of the implementation of the prospective payment system; 
        and
            (C) patients whose care is more extensive and expensive 
        than the typical Medicare patient do not receive supplemental 
        payments in the interim payment system but will receive special 
        protection in the home health care prospective payment system.
        (2) Sense of the house on access to home health care.--It is 
    the sense of the House that--
            (A) Congress recognizes the importance of home health care 
        for seniors and disabled citizens;
            (B) Congress and the Administration should work together to 
        maintain quality care for patients whose care is more extensive 
        and expensive than the typical Medicare patient, including the 
        most ill and infirmed Medicare beneficiaries, while home health 
        care agencies operate in the interim payment system; and
            (C) Congress and the Administration should work together to 
        avoid the implementation of the 15 percent reduction in the 
        prospective payment system and ensure timely implementation of 
        that system.

SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING MEDICARE+CHOICE PROGRAMS/
              REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

    It is the sense of the House that the Medicare+Choice regional 
disparity among reimbursement rates is unfair, and that full funding of 
the Medicare+Choice Program is a priority as Congress considers any 
Medicare reform legislation.

SEC. 317. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON DIRECTING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
              TO ACCEPT NEGATIVE NUMBERS IN FARM INCOME AVERAGING.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds that--
        (1) farmers' and ranchers' incomes vary widely from year-to-
    year due to uncontrollable markets and unpredictable weather;
        (2) in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Congress enacted 3-year 
    farm income averaging to protect agricultural producers from 
    excessive tax rates in profitable years;
        (3) last year, the Internal Revenue Service proposed final 
    regulations for averaging farm income, which failed to make clear 
    that taxable income in a given year may be a negative number; and
        (4) this Internal Revenue Service interpretation can result in 
    farmers paying additional taxes during years in which they 
    experience a loss in income.
    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that 
legislation should be considered during this session of the 106th 
Congress to direct the Internal Revenue Service to count any net loss 
of income in determining the proper rate of taxation.

SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE 
              FOUNDATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds that--
        (1) the year 2000 will mark the 50th Anniversary of the 
    National Science Foundation;
        (2) the National Science Foundation is the largest supporter of 
    basic research in the Federal Government;
        (3) the National Science Foundation is the second largest 
    supporter of university-based research;
        (4) research conducted by the grantees of the National Science 
    Foundation has led to innovations that have dramatically improved 
    the quality of life of all Americans;
        (5) grants made by the National Science Foundation have been a 
    crucial factor in the development of important technologies that 
    Americans take for granted, such as lasers, Magnetic Resonance 
    Imaging, Doppler Radar, and the Internet;
        (6) because basic research funded by the National Science 
    Foundation is high-risk, cutting edge, fundamental, and may not 
    produce tangible benefits for over a decade, the Federal Government 
    is uniquely suited to support such research; and
        (7) the National Science Foundation's focus on peer-reviewed 
    merit based grants represents a model for research agencies across 
    the Federal Government.
    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that the 
function 250 (Basic Science) levels assume an amount of funding which 
ensures that the National Science Foundation is a priority in the 
resolution; and that the National Science Foundation's critical role in 
funding basic research, which leads to the innovations that assure the 
Nation's economic future, and cultivate America's intellectual 
infrastructure, should be recognized.

SEC. 319. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES.

    It is the sense of the House that the Medicare Payment Advisory 
Commission should continue to carefully monitor the Medicare skilled 
nursing benefit to determine if payment rates are sufficient to provide 
quality care, and that if reform is recommended, Congress should pass 
legislation as quickly as possible to assure quality skilled nursing 
care.

SEC. 320. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON SPECIAL EDUCATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds that--
        (1) all children deserve a quality education, including 
    children with disabilities;
        (2) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act provides 
    that the Federal, State, and local governments are to share in the 
    expense of educating children with disabilities and commits the 
    Federal Government to pay up to 40 percent of the national average 
    per pupil expenditure for children with disabilities;
        (3) the high cost of educating children with disabilities and 
    the Federal Government's failure to fully meet its obligation under 
    the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act stretches limited 
    State and local education funds, creating difficulty in providing a 
    quality education to all students, including children with 
    disabilities;
        (4) the current level of Federal funding to States and 
    localities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is 
    contrary to the goal of ensuring that children with disabilities 
    receive a quality education;
        (5) the Federal Government has failed to appropriate 40 percent 
    of the national average per pupil expenditure per child with a 
    disability as required under the Individuals with Disabilities 
    Education Act to assist States and localities to educate children 
    with disabilities; and
        (6) the levels in function 500 (Education) for fiscal year 2001 
    assume sufficient discretionary budget authority to accommodate 
    fiscal year 2001 appropriations for the Individuals with 
    Disabilities Education Act, at least $2,000,000,000 above such 
    funding levels appropriated in fiscal year 2000.
    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that--
        (1) function 500 (Education) levels assume at least a 
    $2,000,000,000 increase in fiscal year 2001 over the current fiscal 
    year to reflect the commitment of Congress to appropriate 40 
    percent of the national per pupil expenditure for children with 
    disabilities by a date certain;
        (2) Congress and the President should increase fiscal year 2001 
    funding for programs under the Individuals with Disabilities 
    Education Act by at least $2,000,000,000 above fiscal year 2000 
    appropriated levels;
        (3) Congress and the President should give programs under the 
    Individuals with Disabilities Education Act the highest priority 
    among Federal elementary and secondary education programs by 
    meeting the commitment to fund the maximum State grant allocation 
    for educating children with disabilities under such Act prior to 
    authorizing or appropriating funds for any new education 
    initiative;
        (4) Congress and the President may consider, if new or 
    increased funding is authorized or appropriated for any elementary 
    and secondary education initiative that directs funds to local 
    educational agencies, providing the flexibility in such 
    authorization or appropriation necessary to allow local educational 
    agencies the authority to use such funds for programs under the 
    Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; and
        (5) if a local educational agency chooses to utilize the 
    authority under section 613(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Individuals with 
    Disabilities Education Act to treat as local funds up to 20 percent 
    of the amount of funds the agency receives under part B of such Act 
    that exceeds the amount it received under that part for the 
    previous fiscal year, then the agency should use those local funds 
    to provide additional funding for any Federal, State, or local 
    education program.

SEC. 321. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING HCFA DRAFT GUIDELINES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds that--
        (1) on February 15, 2000, the Health Care Financing 
    Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services 
    issued a draft Medicaid School-Based Administrative Claiming (MAC) 
    Guide; and
        (2) in its introduction, the stated purpose of the draft MAC 
    Guide is to provide information for schools, State Medicaid 
    agencies, HCFA staff, and other interested parties on the existing 
    requirements for claiming Federal funds under the Medicaid Program 
    for the costs of administrative activities, such as Medicaid 
    outreach, that are performed in the school setting associated with 
    school-based health services programs.
    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that--
        (1) many school-based health programs provide a broad range of 
    services that are covered by Medicaid, affording access to care for 
    children who otherwise might well go without needed services;
        (2) such programs also can play a powerful role in identifying 
    and enrolling children who are eligible for Medicaid, as well as 
    the State Children's Health Insurance programs;
        (3) undue administrative burdens may be placed on school 
    districts and States and deter timely application approval;
        (4) the Health Care Financing Administration should 
    substantially revise the current draft MAC Guide because it appears 
    to promulgate new rules that place excessive administrative burdens 
    on participating school districts;
        (5) the goal of the revised guide should be to encourage the 
    appropriate use of Medicaid school-based services without undue 
    administrative burdens; and
        (6) the best way to ensure the continued viability of Medicaid 
    school-based services is to guarantee that the guidelines are fair 
    and responsible.

    tools demonstrating success at empowering low-income workers;
        (4) middle and upper income Americans currently benefit from 
    tax incentives for building assets; and
        (5) the Federal Government should utilize the Federal tax code 
    to provide low-income Americans with incentives to work and build 
    assets in order to permanently escape poverty.
    (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that the 
provisions of this resolution assume that Congress should modify the

buying a first home, starting a business, obtaining an education, or 
taking other measures to prepare for the future.

    recognized, and such Federal assistance as low-interest loan 
    programs, community development block grant reforms, emergency 
    radio spectrum reallocations, and volunteer fire assistance 
    programs, should be considered; and
