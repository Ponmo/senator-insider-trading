                               RESOLUTION


 
            Expressing support for the Pledge of Allegiance.

Whereas this country was founded on religious freedom by founders, many of whom 
        were deeply religious;
Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution embodies principles intended to 
        guarantee freedom of religion both through the free exercise thereof and 
        by prohibiting the government establishing a religion;
Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance was written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist 
        Minister, and first published in the September 8, 1892, issue of the 
        Youth's Companion;
Whereas Congress in 1954 added the words ``under God'' to the Pledge of 
        Allegiance;
Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance has for almost 50 years included references to 
        the U.S. flag, the country, to our country having been established as a 
        union ``under God'' and to this country being dedicated to securing 
        ``liberty and justice for all;''
Whereas the Congress in 1954 believed it was acting constitutionally when it 
        revised the Pledge of Allegiance;
Whereas this Senate of the 107th Congress believes that the Pledge of Allegiance 
        is not an unconstitutional expression of patriotism;
Whereas patriotic songs, engravings on U.S. legal tender, engravings on Federal 
        buildings also contain general references to ``God'';
Whereas in accordance with decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, public school 
        students cannot be forced to recite the Pledge of Allegiance without 
        violating their First Amendment rights; and
Whereas the Congress expects that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
        Circuit will rehear the case of Newdow v. U.S. Congress, en banc: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate strongly disapproves of the Ninth Circuit 
Decision in Newdow v. U.S. Congress.
    Sec. 2 That the Senate authorizes and instructs the Senate Legal 
Counsel to seek to intervene in the case to defend the 
constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.
                                 <all>
