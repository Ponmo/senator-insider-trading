SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS RELATING TO STANDARDS ON RISK-BASED CAPITAL.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) there were fewer housing starts in the United States in 1991 than in
  any of the previous 40 years;
  (2) it is in the interest of the United States that good quality, affordable
  housing be available to all Americans;
  (3) risk-based capital standards create an incentive for banks and thrifts
  to make lower-risk loans;
  (4) Federal regulators of depository institutions have limited the favorable
  treatment of housing loans to loans for single-family residences; and
  (5) Federal banking regulators have not adopted an interest rate risk
  component to the risk-based standards and have thereby encouraged banks
  to purchase Government-backed securities instead of making loans.
  (b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that regulators
  of depository institutions should consider making changes in risk-based
  capital standards by accelerating their implementation of an interest rate
  risk component and by reviewing the standards that apply to loans for the
  purchase or construction of housing, especially for loans that finance low-
  and moderate-income housing.
SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING TERMINATION OF THE RESOLUTION
TRUST CORPORATION.
  It is the sense of the Congress that--

  section 21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act; and
  (2) the Resolution Trust Corporation shall not receive any additional failed
  savings and loans after September 30, 1993, in accordance with the Resolution
  Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991.

  institution that received funds, as defined in section 406, or of a holding
  company of such institution, that was performed by that banking agency or
  its predecessor, during the 5-year period preceding the transfer, failure,
  or receipt of funds. Each appropriate banking agency other than the National
  Credit Union Administration Board shall consult with the Federal Deposit
  Insurance Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation prior to making
  such reports available to the public.
  (b) DELAY OF PUBLICATION-
  (1) THREATS TO SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF INSTITUTION- If the appropriate banking

  would seriously threaten the safety or soundness of an insured depository
  institution, such agency may initially delay release of the examination
  report for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 12 months from the
  date of the transfer, failure, or receipt of funds described in section
  406. Such determination may be renewed on an annual basis.
  (2) ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS- If the appropriate banking agency or the
  Resolution Trust Corporation determines in writing that release of a
  portion of an examination report would hinder an ongoing investigation of
  alleged negligence, or of other activity that would give rise to either
  administrative or civil proceedings, the portion of the examination report
  directly pertaining to the alleged negligence or other activity, may be
  withheld from release during the investigation, until a notice of charges
  is issued, a complaint is filed, or for a period not to exceed 24 months
  from the date of the transfer, failure, or receipt of funds described in
