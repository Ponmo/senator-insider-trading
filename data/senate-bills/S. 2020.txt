SEC. 405. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON USE OF NO-BID CONTRACTING BY FEDERAL 
              EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) on September 8, 2005, the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency announced that it had awarded 4 contracts for emergency 
        housing relief following Hurricane Katrina to The Shaw Group of 
        Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Fluor Corporation of Aliso Viejo, 
        California, Bechtel National of San Francisco, California, and 
        CH2M Hill of Denver, Colorado;
            (2) these contracts were awarded with no competition from 
        other capable firms, and up to $100,000,000 in taxpayer funds 
        were authorized for each of these contracts;
            (3) in the midst of concerns about abusive and 
        irresponsible spending of taxpayer funds, the Federal Emergency 
        Management Agency pledged to re-bid these noncompetitive 
        contracts, with Acting Under Secretary of Emergency 
        Preparedness and Response, R. David Paulison, stating before 
        the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs of 
        the Senate that ``[a]ll of these no-bid contracts, we are going 
        to go back and re-bid'';
            (4) the Federal Emergency Management Agency has yet to 
        reopen these 4 contracts to competitive bidding, and declared 
        on November 11, 2005, that these contracts would not be 
        reopened for bidding until February 2006;
            (5) by February 2006, the majority of the contracts will 
        have been completed and the majority of taxpayer funds will 
        have been spent;
            (6) large and politically-connected firms continue to 
        benefit from no-bid and limited-competition contracts, and 
        contracts are not being awarded to capable, local companies;
            (7) according to an analysis in the Washington Post, 
        companies outside the States most affected by Hurricane Katrina 
        have received more than 90 percent of the Federal contracts for 
        recovery and reconstruction;
            (8) the monitoring of Federal contracting practices remains 
        difficult, with a report by the San Jose Mercury News stating 
        ``The database of contracts is incomplete. Information released 
        by Federal agencies is spotty and sporadic. And disclosure of 
        many no-bid contracts isn't required by law''; and
            (9)(A) there is currently no Chief Financial Officer 
        charged with monitoring the flow of all funds to the affected 
        areas; and
            (B) the task of financial management is spread across 
        disparate Federal departments and agencies with inadequate 
        oversight of taxpayer funds.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency should--
            (1) immediately rebid noncompetitive contracts entered into 
        following Hurricane Katrina, consistent with the commitment of 
        the Agency made on October 6, 2005, before millions of taxpayer 
        dollars are wasted on irresponsible and inefficient spending;
            (2)(A) immediately implement the planned competitive 
        contracting strategy of the Agency for recovery work in all 
        current and future reconstruction efforts; and
            (B) in carrying out that strategy, should prioritize local 
        and small disadvantaged businesses in the contracting and 
        subcontracting process; and
            (3) immediately after the awarding of a contract, publicly 
        disclose the amount and competitive or noncompetitive nature of 
        the contract.

                employed in connection with providing services under 
                such contract shall--
                            (i) be hired after the date such contract 
                        is awarded; and
                            (ii) be severely disabled individuals; and
                    (C) such person is otherwise qualified to perform

SEC. 407. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOHA ROUND.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are 
        currently engaged in a round of trade negotiations known as the 
        Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round).
            (2) The Doha Round includes negotiations aimed at 
        clarifying and improving disciplines under the Agreement on 
        Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on 
        Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement) and the 
        Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies 
        Agreement).
            (3) The WTO Ministerial Declaration adopted on November 14, 
        2001 (WTO Paper No. WT/MIN(01)/DEC/1) specifically provides 
        that the Doha Round negotiations are to preserve the ``basic 
        concepts, principles and effectiveness'' of the Antidumping 
        Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement.
            (4) In section 2102(b)(14)(A) of the Bipartisan Trade 
        Promotion Authority Act of 2002, the Congress mandated that the 
        principal negotiating objective of the United States with 
        respect to trade remedy laws was to ``preserve the ability of 
        the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws . . . 
        and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of domestic 
        and international disciplines on unfair trade, especially 
        dumping and subsidies''.
            (5) The countries that have been the most persistent and 
        egregious violators of international fair trade rules are 
        engaged in an aggressive effort to significantly weaken the 
        disciplines provided in the Antidumping Agreement and the 
        Subsidies Agreement and undermine the ability of the United 
        States to effectively enforce its trade remedy laws.
            (6) Chronic violators of fair trade disciplines have put 
        forward proposals that would substantially weaken United States 
        trade remedy laws and practices, including mandating that 
        unfair trade orders terminate after a set number of years even 
        if unfair trade and injury are likely to recur, mandating that 
        trade remedy duties reflect less than the full margin of 
        dumping or subsidization, mandating higher de minimis levels of 
        unfair trade, making cumulation of the effects of imports from 
        multiple countries more difficult in unfair trade 
        investigations, outlawing the critical practice of ``zeroing'' 
        in antidumping investigations, mandating the weighing of 
        causes, and mandating other provisions that make it more 
        difficult to prove injury.
            (7) United States trade remedy laws have already been 
        significantly weakened by numerous unjust and activist WTO 
        dispute settlement decisions which have created new obligations 
        to which the United States never agreed.
            (8) Trade remedy laws remain a critical resource for 
        American manufacturers, agricultural producers, and 
        aquacultural producers in responding to closed foreign markets, 
        subsidized imports, and other forms of unfair trade, 
        particularly in the context of the challenges currently faced 
        by these vital sectors of the United States economy.
            (9) The United States had a current account trade deficit 
        of approximately $668,000,000,000 in 2004, including a trade 
        deficit of almost $162,000,000,000 with China alone, as well as 
        a trade deficit of $40,000,000,000 in advanced technology.
            (10) United States manufacturers have lost over 3,000,000 
        jobs since June 2000, and United States manufacturing 
        employment is currently at its lowest level since 1950.
            (11) Many industries critical to United States national 
        security are at severe risk from unfair foreign competition.
            (12) The Congress strongly believes that the proposals put 
        forward by countries seeking to undermine trade remedy 
        disciplines in the Doha Round would result in serious harm to 
        the United States economy, including significant job losses and 
        trade disadvantages.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any 
        agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development 
        Round of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or any 
        other bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations, that--
                    (A) adopts any proposal to lessen the effectiveness 
                of domestic and international disciplines on unfair 
                trade or safeguard provisions, including proposals--
                            (i) mandating that unfair trade orders 
                        terminate after a set number of years even if 
                        unfair trade and injury are likely to recur;
                            (ii) mandating that trade remedy duties 
                        reflect less than the full margin of dumping or 
                        subsidization;
                            (iii) mandating higher de minimis levels of 
                        unfair trade;
                            (iv) making cumulation of the effects of 
                        imports from multiple countries more difficult 
                        in unfair trade investigations;
                            (v) outlawing the critical practice of 
                        ``zeroing'' in antidumping investigations; or
                            (vi) mandating the weighing of causes or 
                        other provisions making it more difficult to 
                        prove injury in unfair trade cases; and
                    (B) would lessen in any manner the ability of the 
                United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, 
                including the antidumping, countervailing duty, and 
                safeguard laws;
            (2) the United States trade laws and international rules 
        appropriately serve the public interest by offsetting injurious 
        unfair trade, and that further ``balancing modifications'' or 
        other similar provisions are unnecessary and would add to the 
        complexity and difficulty of achieving relief against injurious 
        unfair trade practices; and
            (3) the United States should ensure that any new agreement 
        relating to international disciplines on unfair trade or 
        safeguard provisions fully rectifies and corrects decisions by 
        WTO dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body that have 
        unjustifiably and negatively impacted, or threaten to 
        negatively impact, United States law or practice, including a 
        law or practice with respect to foreign dumping or 
        subsidization.

SEC. 408. MODIFICATION OF BOND RULE.

    In the case of bonds issued after the date of the enactment of this 
Act and before August 31, 2009--
            (1) the requirement of paragraph (1) of section 648 of the

        as met with respect to the securities or obligations referred 
        to in such section if such securities or obligations are held

        pay debt service on the bond issue,
            (2) paragraph (3) of such section shall be applied by 
        substituting ``distributions from'' for ``the investment 
        earnings of'' both places it appears, and
            (3) Paragraph (4) of such section shall be applied by 
        substituting ``March 1, 1985'' for ``October 9, 1969''.

              DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES.

                    (A) which is established under the laws of a 
                foreign jurisdiction, and
                    (B) which, under such laws or the terms of the plan 
                (or both), is subject to requirements substantially 
                similar to the requirements under section 422 or 423 of 
                such Code.
            (2) Substantially similar.--A plan shall not be treated as 
        subject to substantially similar requirements under paragraph 
        (1)(B) unless--
                    (A) the plan is required to cover substantially all 
                employees,
                    (B) in the case of an option under an employee 
                stock purchase plan, the plan is required to provide an 
                option price which is not less than the amount 
                specified in section 423(b)(6) of such Code, except 
                that such section shall be applied by substituting ``80 
                percent'' for ``85 percent'' each place it appears,
                    (C) the plan is required to provide coverage of 
                individuals who, but for the exception of the 
                application of section 409A of such Code by reason of 
                this section, would be subject to tax under such 
                section with respect to the plan, and
                    (D) the plan meets such other requirements as the 
                Secretary of the Treasury prescribes in the regulations 
                under subsection (a).

following new section:

``SEC. 54A. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF RURAL RENAISSANCE BONDS.

    ``(a) Allowance of Credit.--In the case of a taxpayer who holds a 
rural renaissance bond on a credit allowance date of such bond, which 
occurs during the taxable year, there shall be allowed as a credit 
against the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year an amount 
equal to the sum of the credits determined under subsection (b) with 
respect to credit allowance dates during such year on which the 
taxpayer holds such bond.
    ``(b) Amount of Credit.--
            ``(1) In general.--The amount of the credit determined 
        under this subsection with respect to any credit allowance date

        determined with respect to such bond.
            ``(2) Annual credit.--The annual credit determined with 
        respect to any rural renaissance bond is the product of--
                    ``(A) the credit rate determined by the Secretary 
                under paragraph (3) for the day on which such bond was

        determine daily or caused to be determined daily a credit rate 
        which shall apply to the first day on which there is a binding, 
        written contract for the sale or exchange of the bond. The 
        credit rate for any day is the credit rate which the Secretary 
        or the Secretary's designee estimates will permit the issuance 
        of rural renaissance bonds with a specified maturity or 
        redemption date without discount and without interest cost to 
        the qualified issuer.

        Such term also includes the last day on which the bond is 
        outstanding.

        case of a bond which is issued during the 3-month period ending 
        on a credit allowance date, the amount of the credit determined 
        under this subsection with respect to such credit allowance 
        date shall be a ratable portion of the credit otherwise 
        determined based on the portion of the 3-month period during 
        which the bond is outstanding. A similar rule shall apply when 
        the bond is redeemed or matures.
    ``(c) Limitation Based on Amount of Tax.--The credit allowed under 
subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess of--
            ``(1) the sum of the regular tax liability (as defined in 
        section 26(b)) plus the tax imposed by section 55, over
            ``(2) the sum of the credits allowable under this part 
        (other than subpart C thereof, relating to refundable credits).
