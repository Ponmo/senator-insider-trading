H. CON. RES. 136
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
May 31 (legislative day, JANUARY 3), 1989
Received
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
Expressing the sense of the Congress on the movement for democracy in China.
Whereas since mid-April millions of Chinese citizens have engaged in peaceful
demonstrations in Beijing and other Chinese cities, calling for greater
democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of association,
and for a government which is responsive to the people and free of corruption;
Whereas the demonstrators, in carrying out their peaceful protest, have
displayed extraordinary courage, discipline, and restraint;
Whereas such demonstrations reflect a broad-based feeling on the part of many
Chinese that the political reforms which have occurred in China have not kept
pace with the progress of economic reform, and the current difficulties in
economic reform will only heighten the popular desire for political reform;
Whereas the extraordinary demonstrations in China constitute one of the most
significant movements for democracy in modern history;
Whereas on May 20, 1989, the Chinese Government declared martial law in eight
districts of Beijing, and imposed edicts forbidding marches, strikes, class
boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, spreading rumors, attacks on leaders,
and any other `destructive actions';
Whereas on May 20, 1989, the Chinese Government ordered units of the People's
Liberation Army into Beijing in order to restore order;
Whereas military units attempting to enter the center of Beijing have been
met by crowds of pro-democracy demonstrators and have chosen to withdraw or
remain in place rather than use force to move forward;
Whereas in April 1989, the authorities of the Shanghai municipality dismissed
the editor-in-chief of the World Economic Herald, one of China's more
independent newspapers;
Whereas the Chinese authorities have ordered foreign journalists not to go to
Tiananmen Square, have stopped international satellite news transmissions,
and have jammed three of five Voice of America frequencies (the first
time that Voice of America broadcasts to China have been jammed since the
normalization of the United States-China relations in 1979);
Whereas, in the wake of democracy movements in 1978-79 and 1986-87, the
authorities subjected participants in those movements to a variety of
sanctions, and some individuals incarcerated for their peaceful political
activity during those movements remain in prison; and
Whereas an acceleration of political reform, including greater pluralism
and respect for internationally recognized human rights, will have positive
consequences for the development of relations between the United States and
China, and repression of the movement for democracy in China will seriously
impair those relations: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That--
  (1) the Congress looks with admiration on the courage which Chinese citizens
  have demonstrated in striving for democratic political reform, including
  freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and
  freedom of the press, and on the peaceful and disciplined manner with
  which they have pursued their cause;
  (2) the Congress calls on the Chinese Government to resolve the political
  crisis in China without violence, to end martial law, to enter into a
  genuine dialogue with representatives of the demonstrators, to permit a
  free flow of information about the democracy movement, and to embark on a
  program of political reform which includes greater pluralism and respect
  for internationally recognized civil and political rights;
  (3) the Congress calls on the Chinese authorities to refrain from imposing
  sanctions (such as detention and prosecution, and termination of employment
  and student status) on those who have led and participated in the current
  movement for democracy, and to release those Chinese citizens still
  imprisoned for the nonviolent expression of their political beliefs; and
  (4) the Congress calls on all parties to this crisis to exercise restraint,
  and to resolve it in a way that is peaceful and consistent with the
  political aspirations of the Chinese people.
Passed the House of Representatives May 24, 1989.

DONNALD K. ANDERSON,
Clerk.
