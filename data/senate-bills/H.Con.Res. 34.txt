TITLE V—POLICY
SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.
(a) Findings.—The House finds the following:
(1) More than 46 million Americans depend on Medicare for their health security.
(2) The Medicare Trustees report has repeatedly recommended that Medicare’s long-term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in and near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the Congressional Budget Office—
(A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2020 and unable to pay scheduled benefits; and
(B) Medicare spending is growing faster than the economy. Medicare outlays are currently rising at a rate of 7.2 percent per year, and under CBO’s alternative fiscal scenario, mandatory spending on Medicare is projected to reach 7 percent of GDP by 2035 and 14 percent of GDP by 2080.
(3) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of American seniors without adequate health security and younger generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending levels that cannot be sustained.
(b) Policy On Medicare Reform.—It is the policy of this resolution to protect those in and near retirement from any disruptions to their Medicare benefits and offer future beneficiaries the same health care options available to Members of Congress.
(c) Assumptions.—This resolution assumes reform of the Medicare program such that:
(1) Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in and near retirement, without changes.
(2) For future generations, when they reach eligibility, Medicare is reformed to provide a premium support payment and a selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs.
(3) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.
(4) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.
SEC. 502. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.
(a) Findings.—The House finds the following:
(1) More than 50 million retirees and individuals with a disability depend on Social Security for a key part of their income. Since enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the “three-legged stool” of retirement security, which includes employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.
(2) The Social Security Trustees report has repeatedly recommended that Social Security’s long-term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of Social Security becomes more precarious and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social Security disability benefits becomes more pronounced:
(A) In 2018, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted and will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.
(B) In 2037, the combined Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted, and will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.
(C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2037, benefits will be cut 22 percent across the board, devastating those currently in or near retirement and those who rely on Social Security the most.
(3) The current recession has exacerbated the crisis to Social Security. The most recent CBO projections find that Social Security has entered into permanent cash deficits.
(4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, reforms should take into consideration the need to protect lower-income Americans’ retirement security.
(5) Americans deserve action by their elected officials on Social Security reform. It is critical that the Congress and the administration work together in a bipartisan fashion to address the looming insolvency of Social Security. In this spirit, this resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to find solutions by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social Security remains a critical part fo the safety net.
(b) Policy On Social Security.—It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security permanently solvent. This resolution assumes reform of a current law trigger, such that—
(1) (A) if in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund in its annual Trustees’ Report determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in deficit, the Board of Trustees should, not later than September 30 of the same calendar year, submit to the President recommendations for statutory reforms necessary to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th year; and
(B) such recommendations provided to the President should be agreed upon by both Public Trustees of the Board of Trustees;
(2) (A) not later than December 1 of the same calendar year in which the Board of Trustees submits its recommendations, the President shall promptly submit implementing legislation to both Houses of Congress, including recommendations necessary to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th year; and
(B) the Majority Leader of the Senate and the Majority Leader of the House should introduce such legislation upon receipt;
(3) within 60 days of the President submitting legislation, the committees of jurisdiction to which the legislation has been referred should report such legislation, which should be considered by the full House or Senate under expedited procedures; and
(4) legislation submitted by the President should—
(A) protect those in and near retirement;
(B) preserve the safety net for those who rely on Social Security, including survivors and those with disabilities;
(C) improve fairness for participants; and
(D) reduce the burden on, and provide certainty for, future generations.
SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON BUDGET ENFORCEMENT.
(a) Findings.—The House finds the following:
(1) The President’s fiscal year 2012 budget requests a $13 trillion increase in the debt subject to limit over the period of years covered by the budget.
(2) Under the President’s fiscal year 2012 budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office, debt held by the public will rise to 69 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 and will reach 87.4 percent of gross domestic product by 2021.
(3) The Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve, the General Accountability Office, the President’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and ten former Chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisors all concluded that debt is growing at unsustainable rates and must be brought under control.
(4) Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated, “Our national debt is our biggest national security threat.”.
(5) According to the Congressional Budget Office, if entitlements are not reformed, entitlement spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will exceed the historical average of revenue collections as a share of the economy within forty years.
(6) According to the Congressional Budget Office, under current policies, debt would reach levels that the economy could no longer sustain in 2037 and a fiscal crisis is likely to occur well before that date.
(7) To avoid a fiscal crisis, Congress must enact legislation that makes structural reforms to entitlement programs.
(8) Instead of automatic debt increases (the “Gephardt rule” was repealed by the House in House Resolution 5) and automatic spending increases, Congress needs to put limits on spending with automatic reductions if spending limits are not met.
(9) The adoption of a conference report on this concurrent resolution will not cause the automatic passage of an increase in the debt limit by the House of Representatives.
(10) Changes in debt levels assumed in this resolution are contingent upon its proposed spending reductions being achieved.
(11) From 1990 to 2002, there were statutory enforceable limits on discretionary spending.
(12) The budget lacks controls over spending in the short-term and the long-term. Greater transparency and controls, particularly for entitlement spending in the long-term, are needed to provide Congress with tools to tackle this growing threat of a fiscal crisis.
(b) Policy On Debt Controls.—It is the policy of this concurrent resolution on the budget that in order to begin to bring debt under control the following statutory spending and debt controls are needed:
(1) Enforceable statutory caps on discretionary spending at levels set forth in this fiscal year 2012 concurrent resolution on the budget for the period of fiscal years 2012 through 2021.
(2) Any increase in the statutory debt limit be accompanied by the enactment of a budget enforcement mechanism to ensure that if spending reductions are not achieved there would be—
(A) an across-the-board reduction in spending at the end of the year;
(B) a fast-track process or failsafe mechanism to give Congress the ability to expedite consideration of legislation to reduce spending and avoid the automatic across-the-board spending reductions; and
(C) an exemption of Social Security from these enforcement mechanisms, with Social Security solvency ensured as provide in section 502.
(3) Limits on total spending with long-term structural reforms that—
(A) require—
(i) the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to make long-term budget projections (similar to the timeframes of projections made by the Social Security and Medicare trustees);
(ii) the inclusion of the estimated long-term fiscal impact of the President’s budget in the President’s annual budget submission;
(iii) in the Congressional Budget Office’s reestimate of the President’s budget, an estimate of the long-term impact of the President’s budget; and
(iv) in Congressional Budget Office estimates on legislation, an estimate of the long-term impact of legislation that has a significant impact on the long-term budget;
(B) require enactment of enforceable caps on total spending as a share of gross domestic product as set forth in this resolution;
(C) require the review by Congress of Congressional Budget Office projections relative to the statutory caps and enactment of legislation to reduce spending to meet those caps;
(D) require enactment of an enforcement mechanism to ensure that if these spending reductions are not achieved, there would be an across-the-board reduction in spending at the end of the year;
(E) require enactment of a fast-track process or failsafe mechanism to provide Congress with the ability to expedite consideration of legislation to reduce spending and avoid the automatic across-the-board spending reductions; and
(F) exempt Social Security from these enforcement mechanisms, with Social Security solvency ensured as provided in section 501.
TITLE VI—SENSE OF THE HOUSE PROVISIONS
SEC. 601. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON A RESPONSIBLE DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN MUST CONSIDER ALL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THOSE AT THE PENTAGON AND THE OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCIES.
It is the sense of the House that the Nation’s debt is an immense security threat to our country, just as Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated; the Government Accountability Office has recently issued a report documenting billions of dollars of waste and duplication at Government agencies, including the Department of Defense, and the Department of Defense has never passed a clean audit; the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and the bipartisan Rivlin-Domenici Debt Reduction Task Force were correct in concluding that all programs, including national security, should be “on the table” as part of a deficit reduction plan; and any budget plan serious about reducing the deficit must follow this precept to consider all programs, including national security programs, the largest segment of discretionary spending.
SEC. 602. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT.
It is the sense of the House that—
(1) additional legislative action is needed to ensure that States have the necessary resources to collect all child support that is owed to families and allow them to pass 100 percent of support on to families without financial penalty; and
(2) when 100 percent of child support payments are passed to the child, rather than administrative expenses, program integrity is improved and child support participation increases.
