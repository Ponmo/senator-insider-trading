                    ``(A) In general.--For each of fiscal years 2001

                $20,000,000 from funds in the insurance fund under

                specialty crop yields, quality, and final product use 
                in order to allow producers to take preventive actions 
                to increase end-product profitability and marketability 
                and to reduce the possibility of crop insurance claims;

                suppression of fire; and
                    ``(F) develop other risk management tools that 
                specialty crop producers can use to further increase 
                their economic and production stability.

            ``(1) Sales closing date.--The sales closing date for 
        obtaining coverage for a specialty crop under this title may

        the date of the final release of materials for policies from 
        the Risk Management Agency and the Specialty Crops Coordinator.
            ``(2) Purchase during insurance period.--A producer of a 
        specialty crop may purchase new coverage for the specialty 
        crop, or increase coverage levels, at any time during the 
        insurance period, subject to a 30-day waiting period for the 
        coverage to take effect to permit an inspection to verify 
        acceptability by the insurance provider.
    ``(d) Studies of New Specialty Crop Insurance Policies.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Corporation and the Specialty Crops 
        Coordinator authorized under section 507(g) shall jointly 
        conduct studies of the feasibility of developing new insurance 
        policies for specialty crops, including policies based on the 
        cost of production or adjusted gross income, quality-based 
        policies, or an intermediate program with a higher coverage and 
        cost than the catastrophic risk protection offered on the date 
        of enactment of this section.
            ``(2) Submission of results.--Not later than 1 year after 
        the date of enactment of this section, and annually thereafter,

after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture 
shall submit to the President, the Committee on Agriculture of the 
House of Representatives, and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry of the Senate a report assessing--
            (1)(A) the progress made by the Department of Agriculture 
        in expanding crop insurance coverage for new and specialty 
        crops; and
            (B) the plans of the Department to continue to expand 
        coverage for additional crops; and
            (2)(A) whether provision of catastrophic risk protection by 
        private sector insurance providers--
                    (i) has resulted in a uniform quality of risk 
                protection services in all regions of the United 
                States; and
                    (ii) has fulfilled the goal of increased 
                participation in the Federal crop insurance program, 
                particularly in States with traditionally low crop 
                insurance participation rates and States with a high 
                proportion of specialty crops; and
            (B) whether, particularly in States described in 
        subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary should resume direct 
        provision of catastrophic risk protection and performance of 
        loss adjustment functions through local offices of the 
        Department.
