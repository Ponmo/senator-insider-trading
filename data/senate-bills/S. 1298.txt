SEC. 223. REQUIREMENT FOR REVIEW OF BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS 
              AND COMPONENTS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ABM TREATY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) That section 232(a)(1) of the Missile Defense Act of 
        1991 (10 U.S.C. 2431 note) establishes a goal for the United 
        States to comply with the ABM Treaty (including any protocol or 
        amendment thereto) and not develop, test, or deploy any 
        ballistic missile defense system, or component thereof, in 
        violation of that treaty (as modified by any protocol or 
        amendment thereto) while deploying an anti-ballistic missile 
        system capable of providing a highly effective defense of the 
        United States against limited attacks of ballistic missiles.
            (2) That the Department of Defense has conducted no formal 
        compliance reviews of any of the components or systems 
        scheduled for early deployment as part of either the Theater 
        Missile Defense Initiative or the initial limited defense 
        system to be located at Grand Forks, North Dakota.
            (3) That the Department of Defense is continuing to 
        obligate hundreds of millions of dollars during fiscal year 
        1993 for the development and testing of systems or components 
        of ballistic missile defense systems prior to a determination 
        that, if successfully developed, tested, or deployed, those 
        systems and components would be in compliance with the ABM 
        Treaty.
            (4) That the Department of Defense is requesting the 
        authorization and appropriation of additional funds for 
        continued development of such systems and components during 
        fiscal year 1994.
            (5) That the United States and its allies face existing and 
        expanding threats from ballistic missiles capable of being 
        utilized as theater weapon systems that are presently possessed 
        by, being developed by, or being acquired by a number of 
        countries such as Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and others.
            (6) That some theater ballistic missiles presently deployed 
        or being developed (such as the Chinese-made CSS-2) have 
        capabilities equal to or greater than missiles which had been 
        determined to be strategic missiles 20 years earlier under the 
        U.S.-USSR SALT I Interim Agreement of 1972.
            (7) That the ABM Treaty was not intended to, and does not, 
        apply to or limit research, development, testing, or deployment 
        of missile defense systems, system upgrades, or system 
        components that are designed to counter modern theater 
        ballistic missiles regardless of their capabilities, unless 
        such systems, system upgrades, or system components are tested 
        against or have demonstrated capabilities to counter modern 
        strategic ballistic missiles.
            (8) That it is a national security priority of the United 
        States to develop and deploy highly effective theater missile 
        defense systems capable of countering the existing and 
        expanding threats posed by modern theater ballistic missiles, 
        as soon as is technically possible.
            (9) That it is essential that the Secretary of Defense 
        immediately undertake and complete compliance reviews of 
        proposed theater missile defense systems, system upgrades, and 
        system components so as to not delay the development and 
        deployment of such highly effective theater missile defense 
        systems.
            (10) That the Secretary of Defense should immediately 
        report to the Congress on any issue which arises during the 
        course of such compliance reviews which appears to indicate 
        that any provision of the ABM Treaty may limit research, 
        development, testing, or deployment by the United States of 
        highly effective theater missile defense systems capable of 
        countering modern theater ballistic missiles.
    (b) Required Compliance Review.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall 
review the program for each system and system upgrade specified in 
paragraph (2), and the system components, to determine whether the 
development, testing, and deployment of that system or system upgrade 
complies with the ABM Treaty.
    (2) The systems and system upgrades to be reviewed pursuant to 
paragraph (1) are as follows:
            (A) The Patriot Multimode Missile.
            (B) The Extended Range Interceptor (ERINT).
            (C) The Ground-Based Radar for theater missile defenses 
        (GBR-T).
            (D) The Theater High Altitude Area Defense interceptor 
        missile (THAAD).
            (E) The Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system.
            (F) Upgrades to the AEGIS/SPY radar system of the Navy.
            (G) Upgrades to the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) interceptor 
        of the Navy.
    (c) Report Required.--(1) For each system and system upgrade 
specified in paragraph (2) of subsection (b), the Secretary shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the results 
of the review required by that subsection. A report may include the 
results of the reviews of more than one system and system upgrade.
    (2) With regard to the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor, the 
Secretary shall include in the report findings on each of the following 
issues:
            (A) Would the current baseline configuration of the 
        Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor comply with the ABM Treaty if 
        the system were used in conjunction with the planned ground-
        based radar system and its ground-based interceptors at Grand 
        Forks, North Dakota?
            (B) If not, can design changes or operational changes be 
        made to the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor that--
                    (i) will result in the usability of the sensor in 
                conjunction with the planned ground-based radar system 
                and its ground-based interceptors being in compliance 
                with the ABM Treaty; and
                    (ii) will not prevent the system from performing 
                its strategic defense missions with a high degree of 
                effectiveness?
            (C) If not, can the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor be 
        made, through design changes or operational changes, for use 
        only with theater missile defense systems and be in compliance 
        with the ABM Treaty?
            (D) If so, to what extent would the Brilliant Eyes space-
        based sensor enhance the capability of upper-tier theater 
        defense systems and lower-tier theater defense systems, 
        respectively?
    (d) Limitations on Funding.--(1) Not more than one-half of the 
funds reported pursuant to section 227(c) to be allocated for fiscal 
year 1994 for a system or system upgrade specified in subsection (b)(2) 
of this section may be obligated for that system or system upgrade, or 
any of its components, until the Secretary has completed the compliance 
review of such system or system upgrade required by subsection (b) and 
has submitted to the congressional defense committees the report on the 
results of the compliance review of that system or system upgrade as 
required by subsection (c). The preceding sentence does not apply with 
respect to the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system.
    (2) Not more than $50,000,000 may be obligated for the Brilliant

SEC. 226. REPORT ON ACQUISITION STREAMLINING TO ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT 
              OF INITIAL ABM SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Missile Defense Act of 1991 (10 U.S.C. 2431 note) 
        calls for the deployment of an ABM Treaty-compliant anti-
        ballistic missile system capable of providing a highly 
        effective defense of the United States against limited attacks 
        by ballistic missiles.
            (2) That Act directed the Secretary of Defense to structure 
        a development program with the objective of deploying such 
        systems by the earliest date allowed by the availability of 
        appropriate technology and the completion of adequate 
        integrated testing of all systems components.
            (3) Since 1983, in excess of $30,000,000,000 has been 
        provided for research and development of ballistic missile 
        defense capabilities.
            (4) Notwithstanding this huge expenditure of funds on 
        missile defense technologies, the Secretary of Defense has 
        proposed deployment of such a system no sooner than 2004.
            (5) It is incredible that the initial deployment of a 
        limited defense capability requires another 11 years to 
        accomplish within the congressionally mandated guidance.
    (b) Review Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct an 
intensive and extensive review of opportunities to streamline the 
weapon systems acquisition process applicable to the development, 
deployment, and testing of ballistic missile defenses with the 
objective of reducing the cost of deployment and accelerating the 
schedule for deployment without significantly increasing programmatic 
risk or concurrency. In conducting the review, the Secretary shall 
obtain recommendations and advice from the Defense Science Board, the 
faculty of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, and federally 
funded research and development centers supporting the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense.
    (c) Report Required.--Not later than May 1, 1994, the Secretary 
shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on his 
findings resulting from the review together with his recommendations 
for legislation, if any. The Secretary shall submit the report in 
unclassified form, but may also submit a classified version of the 
report if he considers it necessary to classify any of the information 
in his findings or recommendations or any related information.

    (a) Codification.--(1) Chapter 37 of title 10, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 654. Policy concerning homosexuality in the armed forces
    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the 
        United States commits exclusively to the Congress the powers to 
        raise and support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and make 
        rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval 
        forces.
            ``(2) There is no constitutional right to serve in the 
        armed forces.
            ``(3) Pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8 of 
        article I of the Constitution of the United States, it lies 
        within the discretion of the Congress to establish 
        qualifications for and conditions of service in the armed 
        forces.
            ``(4) The primary purpose of the armed forces is to prepare 
        for and to prevail in combat should the need arise.
            ``(5) The conduct of military operations requires members 
        of the armed forces to make extraordinary sacrifices, including 
        the ultimate sacrifice, in order to provide for the common 
        defense.
            ``(6) Success in combat requires military units that are 
        characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and 
        unit cohesion.
            ``(7) One of the most critical elements in combat 
        capability is unit cohesion, that is, the bonds of trust among 
        individual service members that make the combat effectiveness 
        of a military unit greater than the sum of the combat 
        effectiveness of the individual unit members.
            ``(8) Military life is fundamentally different from 
        civilian life in that--
                    ``(A) the extraordinary responsibilities of the 
                armed forces, the unique conditions of military 
                service, and the critical role of unit cohesion, 
                require that the military community, while subject to 
                civilian control, exist as a specialized society; and
                    ``(B) the military society is characterized by its 
                own laws, rules, customs, and traditions, including 
                numerous restrictions on personal behavior, that would 
                not be acceptable in civilian society.
            ``(9) The standards of conduct for members of the armed 
        forces regulate a member's life for 24 hours each day beginning 
        at the moment the member enters military status and not ending 
        until that person is discharged or otherwise separated from the 
        armed forces.
            ``(10) Those standards of conduct, including the Uniform 
        Code of Military Justice, apply to a member of the armed forces 
        at all times that the member has a military status, whether the 
        member is on base or off base, and whether the member is on 
        duty or off duty.
            ``(11) The pervasive application of the standards of 
        conduct is necessary because members of the armed forces must 
        be ready at all times for worldwide deployment to a combat 
        environment.
            ``(12) The worldwide deployment of United States military 
        forces, the international responsibilities of the United 
        States, and the potential for involvement of the armed forces 
        in actual combat routinely make it necessary for members of the 
        armed forces involuntarily to accept living conditions and 
        working conditions that are often spartan, primitive, and 
        characterized by forced intimacy with little or no privacy.
            ``(13) The prohibition against homosexual conduct is a 
        longstanding element of military law that continues to be 
        necessary in the unique circumstances of military service.
            ``(14) The armed forces must maintain personnel policies 
        that exclude persons whose presence in the armed forces would 
        create an unacceptable risk to the armed forces' high standards 
        of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that 
        are the essence of military capability.
            ``(15) The presence in the armed forces of persons who 
        demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts 
        would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of 
        morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are 
        the essence of military capability.
    ``(b) Policy.--A member of the armed forces shall be separated from 
the armed forces under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of 
Defense if one or more of the following findings is made and approved 
in accordance with procedures set forth in such regulations:
            ``(1) That the member has engaged in, attempted to engage 
        in, or solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts 
        unless there are further findings, made and approved in 
        accordance with procedures set forth in such regulations, that 
        the member has demonstrated that--
                    ``(A) such conduct is a departure from the member's 
                usual and customary behavior;
                    ``(B) such conduct, under all the circumstances, is 
                unlikely to recur;
                    ``(C) such conduct was not accomplished by use of 
                force, coercion, or intimidation;
                    ``(D) under the particular circumstances of the 
                case, the member's continued presence in the armed 
                forces is consistent with the interests of the armed 
                forces in proper discipline, good order, and morale; 
                and
                    ``(E) the member does not have a propensity or 
                intent to engage in homosexual acts.
            ``(2) That the member has stated that he or she is a 
        homosexual or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there 
        is a further finding, made and approved in accordance with 
        procedures set forth in the regulations, that the member has 
        demonstrated that he or she is not a person who engages in, 
        attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or 
        intends to engage in homosexual acts.
            ``(3) That the member has married or attempted to marry a 
        person known to be of the same biological sex.
    ``(c) Entry Standards and Documents.--(1) The Secretary of Defense 
shall ensure that the standards for enlistment and appointment of 
members of the armed forces reflect the policies set forth in 
subsection (b).
    ``(2) The documents used to effectuate the enlistment or 
appointment of a person as a member of the armed forces shall set forth 
the provisions of subsection (b).
    ``(d) Required Briefings.--The briefings that members of the armed 
forces receive upon entry into the armed forces and periodically 
thereafter under section 937 of this title (article 137 of the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice) shall include a detailed explanation of the 
applicable laws and regulations governing sexual conduct by members of 
the armed forces, including the policies prescribed under subsection 
(b).
    ``(e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (b) shall be 
construed to require that a member of the armed forces be processed for 
separation from the armed forces when a determination is made in 
accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense 
that--
            ``(1) the member engaged in conduct or made statements for 
        the purpose of avoiding or terminating military service; and
            ``(2) separation of the member would not be in the best 
        interest of the armed forces.
    ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) The term `homosexual' means a person, regardless of 
        sex, who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to 
        engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts, and 
        includes the terms `gay' and `lesbian'.
            ``(2) The term `bisexual' means a person who engages in, 
        attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or 
        intends to engage in homosexual and heterosexual acts.
            ``(3) The term `homosexual act' means--
                    ``(A) any bodily contact, actively undertaken or 
                passively permitted, between members of the same sex 
                for the purpose of satisfying sexual desires; and
                    ``(B) any bodily contact which a reasonable person 
                would understand to demonstrate a propensity or intent 
                to engage in an act described in subparagraph (A).''.
    (2) The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

``654. Policy concerning homosexuality in the armed forces.''.
    (b) Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall revise Department 
of Defense regulations, and issue such new regulations as may be 
necessary, to implement section 654 of title 10, United States Code, as 
added by subsection (a).
    (c) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this section or section 654 of 
title 10, United States Code, as added by subsection (a) may be 
construed to invalidate any inquiry, investigation, administrative 
action or proceeding, court-martial, or judicial proceeding conducted 
before the effective date of regulations issued by the Secretary of 
Defense to implement such section 654.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the suspension of questioning concerning homosexuality 
        as part of the processing of individuals for accession into the 
        Armed Forces under the interim policy of January 29, 1993, 
        should be continued, but the Secretary of Defense may reinstate 
        that questioning with such questions or such revised questions 
        as he considers appropriate if the Secretary determines that it 
        is necessary to do so in order to effectuate the policy set 
        forth in section 654 of title 10, United States Code, as added 
        by subsection (a); and
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should consider issuing 
        guidance governing the circumstances under which members of the 
        Armed Forces questioned about homosexuality for administrative 
        purposes should be afforded warnings similar to the warnings 
        under section 831(b) of title 10, United States Code (article 
        31(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice).

SEC. 547. EMPLOYMENT OF RETIRED MEMBERS BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) It is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to promote democracy throughout the world.
            (2) The armed forces of newly democratic nations often lack 
        the democratic traditions that are a hallmark of the Armed 
        Forces of the United States.
            (3) The understanding of military roles and missions in a 
        democracy is essential for the development and preservation of 
        democratic forms of government.
            (4) The service of retired members of the Armed Forces of 
        the United States in the armed forces of newly democratic 
        nations could lead to a better understanding of military roles 
        and missions in a democracy.
    (b) Congressional Consent.--(1) Chapter 53 of title 10, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 1058. Military service of retired personnel with newly 
              democratic nations
    ``(a) Congressional Consent.--(1) Subject to subsection (b), 
Congress consents to a retired member of the uniformed services 
referred to in subsection (b)--
            ``(A) accepting employment by, or holding an office or 
        position in, the armed forces of a newly democratic nation; and
            ``(B) accepting compensation associated with such 
        employment, office, or position.
    ``(b) Determinations and Approval Required.--(1) The Secretary 
concerned and the Secretary of State shall jointly determine whether a 
nation is a newly democratic nation for the purposes of this section.
    ``(2) The consent provided in subsection (a) for a retired member 
of the uniformed services to accept employment or hold an office or 
position shall apply to a retired member of the armed forces only if 
the Secretary concerned and the Secretary of State jointly approve the 
employment or the holding of such office or position.
    ``(c) Continued Entitlement to Retired Pay and Benefits.--The 
eligibility of a retired member of the uniformed services to receive 
retired or retainer pay and other benefits arising from the retired 
member's status as a retired member of the uniformed services, and the 
eligibility of dependents of such retired member to receive benefits on 
the basis of such retired member's status as a retired member of the 
uniformed services, may not be terminated by reason of employment or 
holding of an office or position consented to in subsection (a).

        that began before October 1, 1986, and that involved 
        significant experience in joint matters (as determined by the 
        Secretary) if the officer served in that assignment for a 
        period of sufficient duration (which may not be less than 12 
        months) for his service to have been considered a full tour of

following: ``Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secretary of 
Defense may, on a case-by-case basis, delay the assignment of a general

        Commandant of the Marine Corps recommended (before the 
        expiration of authority under subsection (e) of such section) 
        that the officer be given such credit, credit was denied that 
        officer or credit for less than a full tour was given that 
        officer, and the Secretary determines that the decision not to 
        give the credit or not to give greater credit, as the case may 
        be, to such officer was incorrect; or
            (2) the Secretary determines that the officer's ability to 
        submit a timely request for consideration for such credit was 
        impaired by involvement of the officer in an operational 
        assignment and, as a result of the failure to submit a timely 
        request, the officer was not recommended for such credit.
    (b) Clarification of Intended Relationship Between Credit and 
Promotions.--Section 933(a)(1) of such Act is amended by striking out 
``chapter 38'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``chapters 36 and 38''.
    (c) Duration of Authority.--The authority of the Secretary of 
Defense under subsection (a) expires at the end of the 60-day period

            (D) The requirements for additional military construction 
        funding that will result from the transfer and relocation of

SEC. 1053. FINDINGS REGARDING DEFENSE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED 
              STATES AND ISRAEL.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The President has made a commitment to maintain the 
        qualitative superiority of the Israeli Defense Forces over any 
        combination of adversary armed forces.
            (2) The President has expressed a desire to enhance United 
        States-Israeli military and technical cooperation, particularly 
        in the areas of missile defense, counter-proliferation of 
        weapons of mass destruction, and counter-proliferation of 
        ballistic missiles.
            (3) Maintaining the qualitative superiority of the Israeli 
        Defense Forces and strengthening United States defense ties 
        with Israel will help to ensure that Israel has the military 
        strength and political support necessary for taking risks for 
        peace while providing Arab states with an incentive to pursue 
        negotiations instead of war.
            (4) The establishment of the United States Israel Science 
        and Technology Commission, the binational Senior Planning 
        Group, and the Technology Transfer Working Group is in the 
        interest of both the United States and Israel.
            (5) It is in the national interests of the United States 
        and Israel for the organizations referred to in paragraph (4) 
        to work to strengthen existing mechanisms for cooperation and 
        to eliminate barriers to further collaboration between the 
        United States and Israel.
            (6) Israel continues to face difficult threats to its 
        national security that are compounded by the proliferation of 
        weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.

SEC. 1054. DEFENSE BURDENSHARING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since fiscal year 1985, the budget of the Department of 
        Defense has declined by 34 percent in real terms.
            (2) During the past few years, the United States military 
        presence overseas has declined significantly in the following 
        ways:
                    (A) Since fiscal year 1986, the number of United 
                States military personnel permanently stationed 
                overseas has declined by almost 200,000 personnel.
                    (B) From fiscal year 1989 to fiscal year 1994, 
                spending by the United States to support the stationing 
                of United States military forces overseas will have 
                declined by 36 percent.
                    (C) Since January 1990, the Department of Defense 
                has announced the closure, reduction, or transfer to 
                standby status of 840 United States military facilities 
                overseas, which is a 50 percent reduction in the number 
                of such facilities.
            (3) The United States military presence overseas will 
        continue to decline as a result of actions by the executive 
        branch and the following initiatives of the Congress:
                    (A) Section 1302 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, which required 
                a 40 percent reduction by September 30, 1996, in the 
                number of United States military personnel permanently 
                stationed ashore in overseas locations.
                    (B) Section 1303 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, which specified 
                that no more than 100,000 United States military 
                personnel may be permanently stationed ashore in NATO 
                member countries after September 30, 1996.
                    (C) Section 1301 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, which reduced 
                the spending proposed by the Department of Defense for 
                overseas basing activities during fiscal year 1993 by 
                $500,000,000.
                    (D) Sections 913 and 915 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, which 
                directed the President to consult with East Asian 
                allies, and to develop a plan, regarding gradually 
                reducing the United States military force structure in 
                East Asia.
            (4) The East Asia Strategy Initiative, which was developed 
        in response to sections 913 and 915 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, has resulted 
        in the withdrawal of more than 12,000 United States military 
        personnel from Japan and the Republic of Korea since fiscal 
        year 1990.
            (5) In response to actions by the executive branch and the 
        Congress, allied countries in which United States military 
        personnel are stationed and alliances in which the United 
        States participates have agreed in the following ways to offset 
        more of the costs incurred by the United States in basing 
        military forces overseas:
                    (A) Under the 1991 Special Measures Agreement 
                between Japan and the United States, Japan will pay by 
                1995 almost all yen-denominated costs of stationing 
                United States military personnel in Japan.
                    (B) The Republic of Korea has agreed to pay by 
                1995, one-third of the won-based costs incurred by the 
                United States in stationing United States military 
                personnel in the Republic of Korea.
                    (C) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
                has agreed that the Infrastructure Program could pay 
                the annual operation and maintenance costs of 
                facilities that would support the reinforcement of 
                Europe by United States military forces.
    (b) Funding Reductions.--(1) The total amount authorized to be 
appropriated to the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance 
and for military construction (including NATO Infrastructure) to 
conduct overseas basing activities during fiscal year 1994 may not 
exceed the amount equal to the baseline for fiscal year 1993 reduced by 
$1,355,500,000.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the baseline for fiscal year 
1993 is the sum of the amounts that were made available for overseas 
basing activities out of the amounts appropriated for such fiscal year 
for the following purposes:
            (A) Operation and maintenance.
            (B) Family housing, operations.
            (C) Family housing, construction.
            (D) Military construction (including NATO Infrastructure).
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
amounts obligated to conduct overseas basing activities should decline 
significantly in fiscal year 1995 and in future fiscal years as--
            (1) the number of United States military personnel 
        stationed overseas continues to decline; and
            (2) the countries in which United States military personnel 
        are stationed and the alliances in which the United States 
        participates assume an increased share of United States 
        overseas basing costs.
    (d) Burdensharing Agreements for Increased Host Nation Support.--
(1) In order to achieve additional savings in overseas basing costs, 
the President should intensify his efforts to negotiate a more 
favorable host-nation agreement with each foreign country to which this 
paragraph applies under paragraph (3)(A).
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a more favorable host-nation 
agreement is an agreement under which such foreign country--
            (A) assumes an increased share of the costs of United 
        States military installations in that country, including the 
        costs of--
                    (i) labor, utilities, and services;
                    (ii) military construction projects and real 
                property maintenance;
                    (iii) leasing requirements associated with the 
                United States military presence; and
                    (iv) actions necessary to meet local environmental 
                standards;
            (B) relieves the Armed Forces of the United States of all 
        tax liability that, with respect to forces located in such 
        country, is incurred by the Armed Forces under the laws of that 
        country and the laws of the community where those forces are 
        located; and
            (C) ensures that goods and services furnished in that

            (1) That, on July 30, 1945, among the closing days of World 
        War II, the U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) was sunk as a result of 
        a torpedo attack on that ship.
            (2) That the memorial to the U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) 
        located on the east bank of the Indianapolis water canal in 
        downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, will honor the personal 
        sacrifice of the 1,197 servicemen who were aboard the U.S.S. 
        Indianapolis (CA-35) on that day, 881 of whom died as one of 
        the greatest single combat losses suffered by the United States 
        Navy in World War II.
            (3) That the memorial will pay fitting tribute to that 
        gallant ship and its final crew, and will forever commemorate 
        the place of the U.S.S. Indianapolis in United States Navy 
        history as the last major ship lost in World War II.
            (4) That, as a memorial to the last major ship lost by the 
        United States Navy in World War II, the memorial to the U.S.S. 
        Indianapolis will rank in importance with the memorial to the 
        U.S.S. Arizona (BB-39), one of the first ships lost by the

        personnel, particularly those who lost their lives at sea in 
        the Pacific Theater during World War II, whose dedication and 
        sacrifice in the cause of liberty and freedom were instrumental 
        in the triumph of the United States in that war.
            (6) That the citizens of the United States have a 
        continuing obligation to educate future generations about the

SEC. 1067. INVOLVEMENT OF ARMED FORCES IN SOMALIA.

    (a) Sense of Congress Regarding United States Policy Towards 
Somalia.--
            (1) Since United States Armed Forces made significant 
        contributions under Operation Restore Hope towards the 
        establishment of a secure environment for humanitarian relief 
        operations and restoration of peace in the region to end the 
        humanitarian disaster that had claimed more than 300,000 lives.
            (2) Since the mission of United States forces in support of 
        the United Nations appears to be evolving from the 
        establishment of ``a secure environment for humanitarian relief 
        operations,'' as set out in United Nations Security Council 
        Resolution 794 of December 3, 1992, to one of internal security 
        and nation building.
    (b) Statement of Congressional Policy.--
            (1) Consultation with the Congress.--The President should 
        consult closely with the Congress regarding United States 
        policy with respect to Somalia, including in particular the 
        deployment of United States Armed Forces in that country, 
        whether under United Nations or United States command.
            (2) Planning.--The United States shall facilitate the 
        assumption of the functions of United States forces by the 
        United Nations.
            (3) Reporting requirement.--
                    (A) The President shall ensure that the goals and 
                objectives supporting deployment of United States 
                forces to Somalia and a description of the mission, 
                command arrangements, size, functions, location, and 
                anticipated duration in Somalia of those forces are 
                clearly articulated and provided in a detailed report 
                to the Congress by October 15, 1993.
                    (B) Such report shall include the status of 
                planning to transfer the function contained in 
                paragraph (2).
            (4) Congressional approval.--Upon reporting under the 
        requirements of paragraph (3) Congress believes the President 
        should by November 15, 1993, seek and receive congressional 
        authorization in order for the deployment of United States 
        forces to Somalia to continue.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The available Federal resources for defense economic 
        adjustment and conversion assistance are spread among 23 
        different Federal departments and agencies.
            (2) Numerous other Federal departments and agencies are 
        involved in related technology reinvestment activities.
            (3) Workers and communities adversely affected by closures 
        of military installations or decreased spending for national 
        defense often experience difficulty finding which Federal 
        department or agency is appropriate for providing assistance 
        needed by such workers and communities.
            (4) Expanded coordination between Federal departments and 
        agencies could greatly improve Federal efforts to assist in 
        defense economic adjustment and conversion.
    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Establishment of an Office of 
Economic Conversion Information.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
the President should work with the Congress to establish within the 
Department of Commerce an Office of Economic Conversion Information 
which, under the joint direction of the Secretary of Commerce and the 
Secretary of Defense, would--
            (1) serve as an information clearinghouse to provide 
        comprehensive information regarding assistance for communities, 
        workers, and businesses that have been adversely affected by 
        closures of military installations and reduced spending for 
        national defense;
            (2) enhance and consolidate existing programs for 
        collecting and disseminating information regarding defense 
        economic adjustment and conversion;
            (3) be widely publicized as the central point of access for 
        the public on issues related to defense economic adjustment and 
        conversion;
            (4) develop data bases of information, to be available to 
        help communities, businesses, and workers dependent on spending 
        for national defense identify and apply for assistance from 
        Federal departments and agencies, including--
                    (A) comprehensive listings and summaries of all 
                major Federal, State, and local economic adjustment and 
                conversion programs;
                    (B) a data base listing information available to 
                the public regarding major defense contract 
                terminations and closures of military installations and 
                identifying affected communities, industries, and jobs;
                    (C) listings and summaries of defense conversion 
                attempts and successes; and
                    (D) relevant reference lists and bibliographies;
            (5) provide information to communities, workers, and 
        businesses by such easily accessible and easily used means as 
        toll-free telephone information lines, inexpensive and 
        frequently updated manuals and other print materials, workshops 
        on clearinghouse services, and on-line computer access to 
        clearinghouse information;
            (6) facilitate a series of community roundtables, involving 
        consultation and briefings with communities, workers, and 
        businesses adversely affected by closures of military 
        installations and reduced spending for national defense, to be 
        held annually in all major regions of the United States so 
        affected; and
            (7) establish a mechanism, coordinated by the Secretary of 
        Commerce and the Secretary of Defense, to ensure adequate 
        cooperation between all Federal departments and agencies that 
        oversee defense economic adjustment and conversion assistance 
        programs.
    (c) Sense of Congress Regarding Evaluation and Funding of the 
Office of Economic Conversion Information.--It is further the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) after the Office of Economic Conversion Information has 
        been in operation for three years, the Secretary of Commerce 
        and the Secretary of Defense should jointly conduct a 
        comprehensive evaluation of the operations of such office and 
        consider whether the purpose of the office should be modified 
        or the office should be terminated; and
            (2) the operating expenses for the Office of Economic 
        Conversion Information should not exceed $5,000,000 for each of 
        the first three full fiscal years in which the office is in 
        operation.

SEC. 1072. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE JUSTIFICATION FOR 
              CONTINUING THE EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCY COMMUNICATION 
              SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--(1) There is a need to re-evaluate all defense 
spending in light of the post-Cold War era and budget and fiscal 
constraints;
    (2) The Extremely Low Frequency Communications System (ELF System) 
was originally designed to play a role in the strategic deterrence 
mission against the former Soviet Union;
    (3) The threat of nuclear war has greatly diminished since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union;
    (4) The ELF System is increasingly in use for communications with 
our SSN attack submarines in addition to our strategic missile 
submarines;
    (5) Military base closing, downsizing of military facilities and 
activities, and termination of selected projects are appropriate in 
light of the end of the Cold War and the approximately 
$4,000,000,000,000 national debt;
    (6) It is appropriate to establish funding priorities within the 
military defense budget; and
    (7) Ongoing studies of the effects of ELF operations on human 
health and the environment are due to be concluded next year.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Now, therefore, it is the sense of Congress 
that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense should conduct an evaluation 
        of the benefits and costs of continued operation of the 
        Extremely Low Frequency Communications System and alternatives 
        thereto, if any;
            (2) the results of such an evaluation should be submitted 
        to the Congressional Defense Committees prior to consideration 
        of the fiscal year 1995 Defense budget request; and
            (3) the Extremely Low Frequency Communication System should 
        again be considered in the next round of military base 
        closures.

SEC. 1073. BASING FOR C-130 AIRCRAFT.

    The Secretary of the Air Force shall determine the unit assignment

the Secretary determines to be in the best interest of the Air Force.

SEC. 1074. IMPORTANCE OF NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHY SURVEY AND RESEARCH IN THE 
              POST-COLD WAR PERIOD.

    (a) The Senate finds that--
            (1) the Oceanographer of the Navy is responsible for the 
        all Navy oceanographic research and survey efforts;
            (2) oceanographic research and surveys are critical 
        investments in the Navy's ability to operate in littoral waters 
        of the world with an increased confidence of operational 
        success;
            (3) oceanographic surveys enable the Navy to conduct naval 
        operations in greater safety, particularly in littoral waters;
            (4) the survey of littoral waters is most safely conducted 
        during periods of peace when conflict is not imminent and the 
        risk to lives and ships are diminished;
            (5) the Navy has reduced their oceanographic research and 
        survey effort by almost 50 percent over the last five years;
            (6) this reduction in effort is the result of undistributed 
        budget reductions required by the Comptroller of the Navy to 
        meet overall Navy budget targets;
            (7) the number of naval ships dedicated to oceanographic 
        survey and research have been reduced from 12 to 7 over the 
        last five years, significantly reducing the Navy's 
        oceanographic survey capability;
    (b) Therefore, it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) additional reductions to the Office of the 
        Oceanographer of the Navy which will further reduce the level 
        of oceanographic survey and research efforts of the Navy should 
        be avoided;
            (2) a window of opportunity exists which allows near 
        unencumbered access to littoral waters which are now available 
        for surveying and research;
            (3) committing limited resources to the Navy's 
        oceanographic research and survey effort should be considered a 
        force multiplier to United States combat forces in future 
        conflicts, particularly in littoral waters;
            (4) the Navy should exploit this opportunity to survey and 
        research these critical littoral waters and maintain funding 
        levels for oceanographic surveying and research.

SEC. 1076. RESEARCH ON EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS AGENTS AND MATERIALS OF 
              ARMED SERVICES PERSONNEL WHO SERVED IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
              WAR.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A number of veterans of the Persian Gulf War have 
        reported unexplained illnesses and claim that such illnesses 
        are a consequence of exposure to chemical, biological, 
        radiological, or other hazardous agents or materials as a 
        result of service in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf 
        War.
            (2) Members of the Armed Forces of the former 
        Czechoslovakian Federative Republic who served on a chemical 
        decontamination team in Southwest Asia during the period of the 
        Persian Gulf War have claimed exposure to chemical agents 
        during such service, and the Czech Minister of Defense has 
        confirmed that members of that chemical decontamination team 
        detected low levels of nerve gas in that region during that 
        period.
            (3) Reports indicate that members of the United States 
        Armed Forces who served in Southwest Asia during the Persian 
        Gulf War may have been exposed to combined chemical warfare 
        agents and other hazardous agents and substances during such 
        service.
            (4) Such exposure may have occurred directly as a result of 
        attack on such members by Iraqi forces or indirectly as a 
        result of prolonged ``downwind'' exposure to airborne chemical 
        warfare agents or other hazardous substances that were 
        dispersed as a consequence of the bombing of Iraqi chemical 
        weapons facilities, nuclear facilities, and other facilities 
        containing hazardous substances.
            (5) It is in the interest of the United States that medical 
        professionals providing care to members of the Armed Forces and 
        to veterans understand the nature of the illnesses that such 
        members and veterans may contract in order to ensure that such 
        professionals have sufficient information to provide proper 
        care to such members and veterans.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) one of the threats to international peace and to the 
        interests of the United States in the post-Cold War era is the 
        proliferation of weapons utilizing chemical, biological, 
        radiological, or other hazardous agents or materials;
            (2) the readiness of the United States to engage in future 
        military conflicts will be directly related to the capability 
        of the United States--
                    (A) to identify the threat to members of the Armed 
                Forces posed by the utilization of such weapons and the 
                agents and materials utilized in such weapons;
                    (B) to protect such members from the adverse 
                effects of exposure to such agents and materials; and
                    (C) to treat the casualties that result from the 
                utilization of such weapons and from exposure to such 
                agents and materials; and
            (3) the Department of Defense is uniquely capable of 
        conducting research into the sources and effects of exposure of 
        members of the Armed Forces during military conflicts to 
        chemical, biological, radiological, and other hazardous agents 
        and materials.
    (c) Contract for Research Facility and Activities.--(1) Subject to 
paragraph (2), the Secretary of the Army shall enter into a contract 
with a hospital or other existing health care or health care research 
facility in order to ensure that the research referred to in paragraph 
(3) is carried out.
    (2)(A) The Secretary shall enter into the contract under paragraph 
(1) using full and open competition.
    (B) The facility referred to in such paragraph shall be affiliated 
with a medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    (3) The research referred to in paragraph (1) is research into the 
effects upon humans of exposure to hazardous agents and materials, 
including chemical and biological warfare agents, toxins, and materials 
to which members of the Armed Forces may have been exposed as a result 
of service in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War.
    (4) Humans may not be exposed to hazardous agents or materials as a 
result of the carrying out of research under this subsection.
    (d) Study on Reports of Exposure to Hazardous Agents and 
Materials.--(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense 
shall carry out a study in order to determine the validity and accuracy 
of claims that members of the Armed Forces who served in Southwest Asia 
during the Persian Gulf War were exposed to combined chemical warfare 
agents, biological warfare agents, biological toxins, and other 
unconventional warfare agents or other environmental conditions 
hazardous to the health of such members as a result of such service. 
The study shall identify the locations at which such exposure, if any, 
occurred and the extent, if any, of such exposure.
    (2) The study under paragraph (1) shall include an investigation of 
such exposure directly as a result of attack on such members by Iraqi 
forces and indirectly as a result of prolonged downwind exposure to 
such agents and toxins dispersed in consequence of the bombing of Iraqi 
chemical weapons facilities, nuclear facilities, and other facilities 
containing hazardous substances.
    (e) Study on Exposure to Depleted Uranium.--The Secretary of the 
Army shall carry out a study of the effects upon humans of exposure to 
fragments of depleted uranium from weapons rounds that have been fired.
    (f) Participation by the Department of Defense.--(1) The Secretary 
of Defense shall ensure that all elements of the Departments of the 
Defense, including all chemical and biological warfare defense 
programs, provide to the facility with which the Secretary of the Army

elements on the identity and quantity of the chemical, biological, 
radiological, and other hazardous agents and materials to which members 
of the Armed Forces may have been exposed as a result of service in 
Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War and on the effects upon 
humans of such exposure.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the elements of the 
Department of Defense referred to in paragraph (1) provide to the 
persons or entities carrying out the study referred to in subsection 
(e) information possessed by such elements on the sources and effects 
of exposure to depleted uranium on the members referred to in paragraph 
(1).
    (g) Reports to Congress.--(1) Not later than each of March 1, 1994, 
and October 1, 1994, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees an interim report on the results during the year 
preceding the report of the research and studies, as the case may be, 
carried out under subsections (c), (d), and (e).
    (2) The reports submitted under this subsection shall be submitted 
in an unclassified form but may have a classified annex.
    (h) Budget Information.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that 
each budget submitted to the Congress under section 1105 of title 31, 
United States Code, for a fiscal year in which the contract referred to 
in subsection (c) is in force, the Secretary carries out the study 
referred to in subsection (d), or the Secretary carries out the study 
referred to in subsection (e), as the case may be, contains a request 
for such funds as the Secretary determines necessary in order to carry 
out the contract or such studies, as the case may be, during that

    (k) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Persian Gulf War'' has 
the meaning given such term in section 101(33) of title 38, United 
States Code.

SEC. 1077. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE PROLIFERATION OF SPACE 
              LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States has joined with other nations in the 
        Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) which restricts the 
        transfer of missiles or equipment or technology that could 
        contribute to the design, development or production of missiles 
        capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction.
            (2) Missile technology is indistinguishable from and 
        interchangeable with space launch vehicle technology.
            (3) Transfers of missile technology or space launch vehicle 
        technology cannot be safeguarded in a manner that would provide 
        timely warning of diversion for military purposes.
            (4) It has been United States policy since agreeing to the 
        guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime to treat 
        the sale or transfer of space launch vehicle technology as 
        restrictively as the sale or transfer of missile technology.
            (5) Previous congressional action on missile proliferation, 
        notably title XVII of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 1991 (Public Law 101-510; 104 Stat. 1738), has 
        explicitly supported this policy through such actions as the 
        statutory definition of the term ``missile'' to mean ``a 
        category I system as defined in the MTCR Annex, and any other 
        unmanned delivery system of similar capability, as well as the 
        specially designed production facilities for these systems''.
            (6) There is strong evidence that emerging national space 
        launch programs in the Third World are not economically viable.
            (7) The United States has successfully dissuaded countries 
        from pursuing space launch vehicle programs in part by offering 
        to cooperate with them in other areas of space science and 
        technology.
            (8) The United States has successfully dissuaded other MTCR 
        adherents, and countries who have agreed to abide by MTCR 
        guidelines, from providing assistance to emerging national 
        space launch programs in the Third World.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Congress supports the strict interpretation by the 
        United States of the Missile Technology Control Regime 
        concerning--
                    (A) the inability to distinguish space launch 
                vehicle technology from missile technology under the 
                regime; and
                    (B) the inability to safeguard space launch vehicle 
                technology in a manner that would provide timely 
                warning of its diversion to military purposes; and
            (2) the United States and the governments of other nations 
        adhering to the Missile Technology Control Regime should be 
        recognized for--
                    (A) the success of such governments in restricting 
                the export of space launch vehicle technology and of 
                missile technology; and
                    (B) the significant contribution made by the 
                imposition of such restrictions to reducing the 
                proliferation of missile technology capable of being 
                used to deliver weapons of mass destruction.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``Missile Technology Control Regime'' or 
        ``MTCR'' means the policy statement, between the United States, 
        the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, 
        Italy, Canada, and Japan, announced on April 16, 1987, to 
        restrict sensitive missile-relevant transfers based on the MTCR 
        Annex, and any amendments thereto.
            (2) The term ``MTCR Annex'' means the Guidelines and 
        Equipment and Technology Annex of the Missile Technology 
        Control Regime, and any amendments thereto.

SEC. 1078. AMERICAN DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES IN GERMANY.

    (a) No embassy, chancery, or consular facilities in Germany other 
than the facilities already occuppied as of January 1, 1993 by United 
States diplomatic personnel may be purchased, constructed, leased or 
otherwise occupied unless such facilities are purchased, constructed, 
modified or leased with funds provided by the German government as an 
offset for the value of facilities returned by the United States 
Government to the Government of Germany pursuant to Article 52 of the 
current Status of Forces Agreement with the Government of Germany.
    (b) The Secretary of State or his representative may not enter into 
any legal instrument to purchase, construct, modify or lease any 
facility in Germany acquired pursuant to subsection (a) of this section 
until the Secretary of Defense certifies that the United States 
Government has received or is scheduled to receive cash payments or 
offsets-in-kind of a value not less than 50 percent of the value of the 
facilities returned by the United States Government to the Government 
of Germany pursuant to Article 52 of the current Status of Forces 
Agreement with the Government of Germany.

SEC. 1079. EFFECTIVE DATE FOR CHANGES IN SERVICEMEN'S GROUP LIFE 
              INSURANCE PROGRAM.

    (a) Use of International Date Line.--Section 1967 of title 38, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(f) The effective date and time for any change in benefits under 
the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Program shall be based on the 
date and time according to the time zone immediately west of the 
International Date Line.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to amendments to chapter 19 of title 38, United 
States Code, that take effect after November 29, 1992.

SEC. 1080. AWARD OF THE NAVY EXPEDITIONARY MEDAL.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of the Navy should 
direct that members who served in Task Force 16, culminating in the 
air-raid commonly known as the ``Doolittle raid on Tokyo'', during 
April 1942, be awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for such service.

SEC. 1081. REPORT ON MILITARY FOOD DISTRIBUTION PRACTICES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Defense Personnel Support Center, a component of 
        the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), purchases more than 90 
        percent of the food supplied to military ``end-users'' such as 
        dining halls, hospitals and other facilities that feed troops.
            (2) Semiperishable items, such as canned goods, are stored 
        in four DLA depots. Perishable items, including fresh and 
        frozen vegetables, fruits, and meats, are stored in 21 
        contractor-operated Defense Subsistence Offices.
            (3) Private sector end-users, including independent 
        restaurants, hospitals, and hotels, obtain their food through 
        direct delivery from distributors.
            (4) A Department of Defense comprehensive inventory 
        reduction plan, issued in May 1990, stated that ``where DoD 
        requirements can be met through commercial distribution systems 
        in a timely and cost-effective fashion, no value is added by 
        pushing items through the DoD warehousing systems.''.
            (5) A June 1993 GAO report determined that the Department 
        of Defense could achieve substantial cost savings by expanding 
        the use of private sector food distributors and practices in 
        the military food supply system.
    (b) Review Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a 
review which evaluates the feasibility and economic benefits resulting 
from the expanded use of full-line distributors to deliver food 
directly to military end-users. The review should address whether the 
expanded use of distributors could reduce depot storage of food (except 
for war reserve stocks and items bound for overseas), and eliminates 
the requirement for Defense Subsistence Offices and certain base 
warehouse activities. The review should include a cost comparison of 
the Department of Defense supply system with the costs of commercial 
distributors. The review should also consider what obstacles may exist 
that would hinder the Department of Defense's ability to procure 
commercial items and institute commercial logistics practices.
    (c) Report.--Not later than March 1, 1994, the Secretary shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees a report on his findings 
from the review together with any recommendations.

SEC. 1082. PREVENTION OF ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OF CERTAIN FORMER 
              MEMBERS OF THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that no person who was a member of 
the armed forces of Iraq during the period from August 2, 1990 through 
February 28, 1991 and who is in a refugee camp in Saudi Arabia as of 
the date of enactment of this Act shall be granted entry into the 
United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 
unless the President certifies to Congress prior to such entry that 
such person--
            (1) assisted the United States or coalition armed forces 
        after defection from the armed forces of Iraq or after capture 
        by the United States or coalition armed forces; and
            (2) did not commit or assist in the commission of war 
        crimes.

SEC. 1083. SHORT TITLE.

    Sections 1083, 1084, and 1085 may be cited as ``NATO Review 
Requirements''.

SEC. 1084. FINDINGS; POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has 
        successfully met the challenge of helping to maintain the 
        peace, security and freedom of the United States and its NATO 
        allies for more than forty years;
            (2) the national security interests of the United States 
        have been well served by the process of consultation, 
        coordination, and military cooperation in the NATO framework;
            (3) recent history has witnessed radical changes in the 
        international security environment, including the fall of the 
        Berlin Wall, the unification of Germany, the disbanding of the 
        Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the Soviet Union;
            (4) the military threats which NATO was established to 
        deter have receded with the end of the Cold War, calling into 
        question both the future value of the alliance and the 
        rationale for United States military deployments in Europe;
            (5) the post-Cold War security situation continues to 
        present a wide array of challenges to United States national 
        interests, many of which interests the United States shares 
        with its allies in Europe and Canada;
            (6) the international community may prove capable of 
        deterring many threats to the common peace if it can respond 
        decisively to aggression;
            (7) the United States must share the burden of its 
        international security commitments with other nations if it is 
        to tend to the needs of its own citizens in a responsible 
        fashion;
            (8) several of the newly democratic nations of Central and 
        Eastern Europe have expressed interest in seeking membership in 
        NATO;
            (9) many of the security challenges facing the post-Cold 
        War world would be best handled through coherent multilateral 
        responses;
            (10) the United States should never send its military 
        forces into combat unless they are provided with the best 
        opportunity to accomplish their objectives with as little risk 
        as possible;
            (11) military interventions against antagonistic armed 
        forces cannot be conducted safely or effectively on a 
        multilateral basis unless such operations are jointly planned 
        in advance and are executed by units which have trained 
        together and are familiar with each others operational 
        procedures;
            (12) NATO is currently the only organization with the 
        experience, trained staff and infrastructure necessary to 
        support military cooperation with the major military allies of 
        the United States;
            (13) the NATO allies already have volunteered to consider 
        requests from the United Nations and the Conference on Security 
        and Cooperation in Europe for assistance in maintaining the 
        peace;
            (14) justification of the relevance of NATO in the post-
        Cold War world will depend largely upon the alliance's ability 
        to adapt its mission and procedures to the new security 
        environment;
            (15) justification of future United States support for the 
        alliance and for a United States military presence in Europe 
        will depend upon NATO's ability to address those security 
        interests which the United States shares with its allies in 
        Europe and Canada;
            (16) a summit meeting of the NATO heads of state, which has 
        been scheduled for January 1994, would present an excellent 
        opportunity for the President of the United States to 
        articulate a new, broader security mission for the alliance in 
        the post-Cold War world, one which will enable it to address a 
        wider array of threats to its members' interests and which will 
        help to share more effectively the burden of international 
        security requirements.
    (b) Policy.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) old threats to the security of the United States and 
        its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have 
        retreated radically but new, more diverse challenges have 
        arisen in the form of ethno-religious conflict in Central and 
        Eastern Europe and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
        destruction in regions proximate to alliance territory and 
        NATO's mission must be redefined so that it may respond to such 
        challenges to its members' security even when those challenges 
        emanate from beyond the geographic boundaries of its members' 
        territories;
            (2) future United States military involvement in, and 
        contributions to, NATO should be determined in relation to the 
        alliance's success or failure in adapting itself to confronting 
        the challenges of the post-Cold War world.

SEC. 1085. REPORT.

    Within 30 calendar days of the enactment of this legislation, the 
President, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the 
Secretary of Defense, shall send a report to the Armed Services 
Committees of the United States Senate and House of Representatives and 
to the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate and the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives. This report 
should contain recommendations on--
            (1) the manner in which NATO can formulate and implement a 
        strategy to address the new, more disparate threats to the

SEC. 1094. LANDMINE MORATORIUM EXTENSION ACT.

    (a) Short Title.--This section shall be titled the ``Landmine 
Moratorium Extension Act of 1993''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Anti-personnel landmines, which are designed to maim 
        and kill people, have been used indiscriminately in 
        dramatically increasing numbers around the world. Hundreds of 
        thousands of noncombatant civilians, including children, have 
        been the primary victims. unlike other military weapons, 
        landmines often remain implanted and undiscovered after 
        conflict has ended, causing massive suffering to civilian 
        populations.
            (2) Tens of millions of landmines have been strewn in at 
        least 62 countries, often making whole areas uninhabitable. The 
        State Department estimates there are more than 10,000,000 
        landmines in Afghanistan, 9,000,000 in Angola, 4,000,000 in 
        Cambodia, 3,000,000 in Iraqi Kurdistan, and 2,000,000 each in 
        Somalia, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia. Hundreds of 
        thousands of landmines were used in conflicts in Central 
        America in the 1980s.
            (3) Advanced technologies are being used to manufacture 
        sophisticated mines which can be scattered remotely at a rate 
        of 1,000 per hour. These mines, which are being produced by 
        many industralized countries, were found in Iraqi arsenals 
        after the Persian Gulf War.
            (4) At least 300 types of anti-personnel landmines have 
        been manufactured by at least 44 countries, including the 
        United States. However, the United States is not a major 
        exporter of landmines. During the past ten years the 
        Administration has approved ten licenses for the commercial 
        export of anti-personnel landmines with a total value of 
        $980,000, and the sale under the Foreign Military Sales program 
        of 108,852 anti-personnel landmines.
            (5) The United States signed, but has not ratified, the 
        1980 Convention on Prohibitations or Restrictions on the Use of 
        Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be 
        Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects. 
        Protocol II of the Convention, otherwise known as the Landmine 
        Protocol, prohibits the indiscriminate use of landmines.
            (6) When it signed the 1980 Convention, the United States 
        stated: ``We believe that the Convention represents a positive 
        step forward in efforts to minimize injury or damage to the 
        civilian population in time of armed conflict. Our signature of 
        the Convention reflects the general willingness of the United 
        States to adopt practical and reasonable provisions concerning 
        the conduct of military operations, for the purpose of 
        protecting noncombatants.''.
            (7) The United States also indicated that it had supported 
        procedures to enforce compliance, which were omitted from the 
        Convention's final draft. The United States stated: ``The 
        United States strongly supported proposals by other countries 
        during the Conference to include special procedures for dealing 
        with compliance matters, and reserves the right to propose at a 
        later date additional procedures and remedies, should this 
        prove necessary, to deal with such problems.''.
            (8) The lack of compliance procedures and other weaknesses 
        have significantly undermined the effectiveness of the Landmine 
        Protocol. Since it entered into force on December 2, 1983, the 
        number of civilians maimed and killed by anti-personnel 
        landmines has multiplied.
            (9) Since the moratorium on United States sales, transfers 
        and exports of anti-personnel landmines was signed into law on 
        October 23, 1992, the European Parliament has issued a 
        resolution calling for a five year moratorium on sales, 
        transfers and exports of anti-personnel landmines, and the 
        Government of France has announced that it has ceased all 
        sales, transfers and exports of anti-personnel landmines.
            (10) On December 2, 1993, ten years will have elapsed since 
        the 1980 Convention entered into force, triggering the right of 
        any party to request a United Nations conference to review the 
        Convention. Amendments to the Landmine Protocol may be 
        considered at that time. A formal request has been made to the 
        United Nations Secretary General for a review conference. With 
        necessary preparations and consultations among governments, a 
        review conference is not expected to be convened before late 
        1994 or early 1995.
            (11) The United States should continue to set an example 
        for other countries in such negotiations by extending the 
        moratorium on sales, transfers and exports of anti-personnel 
        landmines for an additional three years. A moratorium of this 
        duration would extend the current prohibition on the sale, 
        transfer and export of anti-personnel landmines a sufficient 
        time to take into account the results of a United Nations 
        review conference.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--
            (1) It shall be the policy of the United States to seek 
        verifiable international agreements prohibiting the sale, 
        transfer or export, and further limiting the manufacture, 
        possession and use of anti-personnel landmines.
            (2) It is the sense of the Congress that the President 
        should submit the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional 
        Weapons to the Senate for ratification. Furthermore, the 
        Administration should participate in a United Nations 
        conference to review the Landmine Protocol, and actively seek 
        to negotiate under United Nations auspices a modification of 
        the Landmine Protocol, or another international agreement, to 
        prohibit the sale, transfer or export of anti-personnel 
        landmines, and to further limit their manufacture, possession 
        and use.
    (d) Moratorium on Transfers of Anti-Personnel Landmines Abroad.--
For a period of three years beginning on the date of enactment of this 
Act--
            (1) no sale may be made or financed, no transfer may be 
        made, and no license for export may be issued, under the Arms 
        Export Control Act, with respect to any anti-personnel 
        landmine; and
            (2) no assistance may be provided under the Foreign 
        Assistance Act of 1961, with respect to the provision of any 
        anti-personnel landmine.
    (e) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``anti-
personnel landmine'' means--
            (1) any munition placed under, on, or near the ground or 
        other surface area, or delivered by artillery, rocket, mortar, 
        or similar means or dropped from an aircraft and which is 
        designed to be detonated or exploded by the presence, 
        proximity, or contact of a person;
            (2) any device or material which is designed, constructed, 
        or adapted to kill or injure and which functions unexpectedly 
        when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless 
        object or performs an apparently safe act;
            (3) any manually-emplaced munition or device designed to 
        kill, injure, or damage and which is actuated by remote control 
        or automatically after a lapse of time.

  TITLE XI--COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WITH STATES OF FORMER SOVIET

SEC. 1101. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Cooperative Threat Reduction Act 
of 1993''.

SEC. 1102. FINDINGS ON COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION.

    The Congress finds that it is in the national security interest of 
the United States for the United States to do the following:
            (1) Facilitate, on a priority basis, the transportation, 
        storage, safeguarding, and elimination of nuclear and other 
        weapons of the independent states of the former Soviet Union, 
        including--
                    (A) the safe and secure storage of fissile 
                materials derived from the elimination of nuclear 
                weapons;
                    (B) the dismantlement of--
                            (i) intercontinental ballistic missiles and 
                        launchers for such missiles;
                            (ii) submarine-launched ballistic missiles 
                        and launchers for such missiles; and
                            (iii) heavy bombers; and
                    (C) the elimination of chemical, biological and 
                other weapons capabilities.

                  TITLE XXIX--BASE CLOSURE ASSISTANCE

SEC. 2901. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Base Closure Communities Act of 
1993''.

SEC. 2902. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The closure and realignment of military installations 
        within the United States is a necessary consequence of the end 
        of the Cold War and of changed United States national security 
        requirements.
            (2) A military installation is a significant source of 
        employment for many communities, and the closure or realignment 
        of an installation may cause economic hardship for such 
        communities.
            (3) It is in the interest of the United States that the 
        Federal Government facilitate the economic recovery of 
        communities that experience adverse economic circumstances as a 
        result of the closure or realignment of a military 
        installation.
            (4) The Federal Government may facilitate the economic 
        recovery of a community by preventing or reducing the loss of 
        jobs that might otherwise occur as a result of such a closure 
        or realignment.
            (5) It is in the interest of the United States that the 
        Federal Government work with communities that experience 
        adverse economic circumstances as the result of the closure of 
        military installations to identify and implement means of 
        reutilizing or redeveloping such installations in a beneficial 
        manner.
            (6) The Federal Government may provide such assistance by 
        accelerating environmental restoration at military 
        installations to be closed, and by closing such installations, 
        in a manner that best ensures the beneficial reutilization or 
        redevelopment of such installations by such communities.
            (7) The Federal Government may best ensure such 
        reutilization and redevelopment by making available real and 
        personal property of the closing military installations to 
        communities affected by such closures on a timely basis, and, 
        if appropriate, at less than fair market value.

    ``(ii) If no local reuse authority recognized and funded by the

            ``(II) a local government agency or State government agency 
        designated for the purpose of such consultation by the chief 
        executive office of that State.

of Defense may not carry out any of the activities referred to in 
clause (iv), until the earlier of--
