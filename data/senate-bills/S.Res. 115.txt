                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate that America's World War II veterans 
     and their families are deserving of this Nation's respect and 
          appreciation on the Fiftieth Anniversary of V-E Day.
Whereas on May 7, 1945, in Reims, France, the German High command signed the 
        document of surrender, surrendering all air, land and sea forces 
        unconditionally to the Allies;
Whereas President Harry S Truman proclaimed May 8, 1945, to be V-E Day;
Whereas May 8, 1995, is the Fiftieth Anniversary of that proclamation;
Whereas, the courage and sacrifice of the American fighting men and women who 
        served with distinction to save the world from tyranny and aggression 
        should always be remembered: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the United States Senate joins with a grateful 
Nation in expressing our respect and appreciation to the men and women 
who served in World War II, and their families. Further, we remember 
and pay tribute to those Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice and 
gave their life for their country.
