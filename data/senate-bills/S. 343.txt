    [``(a) Before publishing notice of a proposed rulemaking for any 
rule (or, in the case of a notice of a proposed rulemaking that has 
been published on or before the effective date of this subchapter, no 
later than 30 days after such date), each agency shall determine 
whether the rule is or is not a major rule within the meaning of 
section 621(4)(A)(i) and, if it is not, determine whether it is a major 
rule under section 621(4)(A)(ii). For the purpose of any such 
determination, a group of closely related rules shall be considered as 
one rule.
    [``(b)(1) If an agency has determined that a rule is not a major 
rule, the Director or a designee of the President may, as appropriate, 
determine that the rule is a major rule no later than 30 days after the 
publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking for the rule (or, in 
the case of a notice of proposed rulemaking that has been published on 
or before the effective date of this subchapter, no later than 60 days 
after such date).

published a determination that a rule is a major rule after the 
publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking for the rule, the

cost-benefit analysis for the rule and shall publish in the Federal 
Register a summary of such analysis.
    [``(ii) Following the issuance of an initial cost-benefit analysis 
under clause (i), the agency shall give interested persons an 
opportunity to comment pursuant to section 553 in the same manner as if 
the draft cost-benefit analysis had been issued with the notice of 
proposed rulemaking.

        substantially achieve the rulemaking objectives in a more cost-
        effective manner than the alternatives to the proposed rule,

of basis and purpose.

        statute under which the agency is acting, a reasonable

                market-based mechanisms identified under subsection 
                (c)(2)(C)(iii).
    [``(e)(1) The analysis of the benefits and costs of a proposed and

feasible, a quantification or numerical estimate of the quantifiable 
benefits and costs. Such quantification or numerical estimate shall be 
made in the most appropriate units of measurement, using comparable 
assumptions, including time periods, shall specify the ranges of 
predictions, and shall explain the margins of error involved in the 
quantification methods and in the estimates used. An agency shall 
describe the nature and extent of the nonquantifiable benefits and 
costs of a final rule pursuant to this section in as precise and 
succinct a manner as possible. An agency shall not be required to make 
such evaluation primarily on a mathematical or numerical basis.
    [``(2)(A) In evaluating and comparing costs and benefits and in 
evaluating the risk assessment information developed under subchapter 
III, the agency shall not rely on cost, benefit, or risk assessment 
information that is not accompanied by data, analysis, or other 
supporting materials that would enable the agency and other persons 
interested in the rulemaking to assess the accuracy, reliability, and 
uncertainty factors applicable to such information.

of a proposed and final rule to its costs shall be clearly articulated 
in accordance with this section.
    [``(f) As part of the promulgation of each major rule that 
addresses risks to human health, safety, or the environment, the head 
of the agency or the President shall make a determination that--

        subsection (c)(2)(H) are based on a scientific evaluation of

    [``(g) The preparation of the initial or final cost-benefit 
analysis required by this section shall only be performed under the 
direction of an officer or employee of the agency. The preceding 
sentence shall not preclude a person outside the agency from gathering 
data or information to be used by the agency in preparing any such 
cost-benefit analysis or from providing an explanation sufficient to 
permit the agency to analyze such data or information. If any such data 
or information is gathered or explained by a person outside the agency, 
the agency shall specifically identify in the initial or final cost-
benefit analysis the data or information gathered or explained and the 
person who gathered or explained it, and shall describe the arrangement 
by which the information was procured by the agency, including the 
total amount of funds expended for such procurement.

    [``(a) Compliance or noncompliance by an agency with the provisions

review except in connection with review of a final agency rule and 
according to the provisions of this section.
    [``(b) Any determination by a designee of the President or the 
Director that a rule is, or is not, a major rule shall not be subject 
to judicial review in any manner.

major rule under section 621(4)(A)(i) shall be set aside by a reviewing 
court only upon a clear and convincing showing that the determination 
is erroneous in light of the information available to the agency at the 
time the agency made the determination. Any determination by an agency 
that a rule is, or is not, a major rule under section 621(4)(A)(ii) 
shall not be subject to judicial review in any manner.
    [``(d) If the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment required 
under this chapter has been wholly omitted for any major rule, a court 
shall vacate the rule and remand the case for further consideration. If 
an analysis or assessment has been performed, the court shall not 
review to determine whether the analysis or assessment conformed to the 
particular requirements of this chapter.
    [``(e) Any cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment prepared under 
this chapter shall not be subject to judicial consideration separate or 
apart from review of the agency action to which it relates. When an 
action for judicial review of an agency action is instituted, any 
regulatory analysis for such agency action shall constitute part of the 
whole administrative record of agency action for the purpose of 
judicial review of the agency action, and shall, to the extent 
relevant, be considered by a court in determining the legality of the 
agency action.

                  [``SUBCHAPTER III--RISK ASSESSMENTS

[``Sec. 631. Findings and purposes
    [``(a) The Congress finds that:
            [``(1) Environmental, health, and safety regulations have 
        lead to dramatic improvements in the environment and have 
        significantly reduced risks to human health; except--
                    [``(A) many regulations have been more costly and 
                less effective than necessary; and
                    [``(B) too often, regulatory priorities have not 
                been based upon a realistic consideration of risk, risk 
                reduction opportunities, and costs.
            [``(2) The public and private resources available to 
        address health, safety, and environmental risks are not 
        unlimited. Those resources should be allocated to address the 
        greatest needs in the most cost-effective manner and to ensure 
        that the incremental costs of regulatory options are reasonably 
        related to the incremental benefits.
            [``(3) To provide more cost-effective protection to human 
        health, safety, and the environment, regulatory priorities 
        should be supported by realistic and plausible scientific risk 
        assessments and risk management choices that are grounded in 
        cost-benefit principles.
            [``(4) Risk assessment has proved to be a useful 
        decisionmaking tool, except--
                    [``(A) improvements are needed in both the quality 
                of assessments and the characterization and 
                communication of findings;
                    [``(B) scientific and other data must be better 
                collected, organized, and evaluated; and
                    [``(C) the critical information resulting from a 
                risk assessment must be effectively communicated in an 
                objective and unbiased manner to decision makers, and 
                from decision makers to the public.
            [``(5) The public stakeholders should be involved in the 
        decisionmaking process for regulating risks. The public has the 
        right to know about the risks addressed by regulation, the 
        amount of risk reduced, the quality of the science used to 
        support decisions, and the cost of implementing and complying 
        with regulations. Such knowledge will allow for public scrutiny 
        and will promote the quality, integrity, and responsiveness of 
        agency decisions.
    [``(b) The purposes of this subchapter are to--
            [``(1) present the public and executive branch with the 
        most realistic and plausible information concerning the nature 
        and magnitude of health, safety, and environmental risks to 
        promote sound regulatory decisions and public education;
            [``(2) provide for full consideration and discussion of 
        relevant data and potential methodologies;
            [``(3) require explanation of significant choices in the 
        risk assessment process that will allow for better public 
        understanding; and
            [``(4) improve consistency within the executive branch in 
        preparing risk assessments and risk characterizations.

        The term includes both the process and specific outputs, 
        including--
                    [``(A) the element of a risk assessment that

        agency action. Such term includes an assessment performed by a 
        regulated party and submitted to an agency under a regulatory 
        requirement.
            [``(8) The term `substitution risk' means a reasonably 
        likely increased risk to human health, safety, or the

            [(1) In general.--Section 611 of title 5, United States 
        Code, is amended to read as follows:
[``Sec. 611. Judicial review
    [``(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no later than 1 year 
after the effective date of a final rule with respect to which an 
agency--
            [``(A) certified, pursuant to section 605(b), that such 
        rule would not have a significant economic impact on a 
        substantial number of small entities; or
            [``(B) prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis 
        pursuant to section 604,
an affected small entity may petition for the judicial review of such 
certification or analysis in accordance with this subsection. A court 
having jurisdiction to review such rule for compliance with section 553 
of this title or under any other provision of law shall have 
jurisdiction to review such certification or analysis.
    [``(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of a 
provision of law that requires that an action challenging a final 
agency regulation be commenced before the expiration of the 1-year 
period provided in paragraph (1), such lesser period shall apply to a 
petition for the judicial review under this subsection.
    [``(B) In a case in which an agency delays the issuance of a final 
regulatory flexibility analysis pursuant to section 608(b), a petition 
for judicial review under this subsection shall be filed no later 
than--
            [``(i) 1 year; or
            [``(ii) in a case in which a provision of law requires that 
        an action challenging a final agency regulation be commenced 
        before the expiration of the 1-year period provided in 
        paragraph (1), the number of days specified in such provision 
        of law,
after the date the analysis is made available to the public.
    [``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term `affected small 
entity' means a small entity that is or will be adversely affected by 
the final rule.
    [``(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the 
authority of any court to stay the effective date of any rule or 
provision thereof under any other provision of law.
    [``(5)(A) In a case in which an agency certifies that such rule 
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities, the court may order the agency to prepare a final 
regulatory flexibility analysis pursuant to section 604 if the court 
determines, on the basis of the rulemaking record, that the 
certification was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or 
otherwise not in accordance with law.
    [``(B) In a case in which the agency prepared a final regulatory 
flexibility analysis, the court may order the agency to take corrective 
action consistent with section 604 if the court determines, on the 
basis of the rulemaking record, that the final regulatory flexibility 
analysis was prepared by the agency without complying with section 604.
    [``(6) If, by the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of 
the order of the court pursuant to paragraph (5) (or such longer period 
as the court may provide), the agency fails, as appropriate--
            [``(A) to prepare the analysis required by section 604; or
            [``(B) to take corrective action consistent with section 
        604 of this title,
the court may stay the rule or grant such other relief as it deems 
appropriate.
    [``(7) In making any determination or granting any relief 
authorized by this subsection, the court shall take due account of the 
rule of prejudicial error.
    [``(b) In an action for the judicial review of a rule, any 
regulatory flexibility analysis for such rule (including an analysis 
prepared or corrected pursuant to subsection (a)(5)) shall constitute 
part of the whole record of agency action in connection with such 
review.
    [``(c) Nothing in this section bars judicial review of any other 
impact statement or similar analysis required by any other law if 
judicial review of such statement or analysis is otherwise provided by 
law.''.
            [(2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) 
        shall take effect on the effective date of this Act, except 
        that the judicial review authorized by section 611(a) of title 
        5, United States Code (as added by subsection (a)), shall apply 
        only to final agency rules issued after such effective date.
    [(c) Presidential Authority.--Nothing in this Act shall limit the 
exercise by the President of the authority and responsibility that the 
President otherwise possesses under the Constitution and other laws of 
the United States with respect to regulatory policies, procedures, and 
programs of departments, agencies, and offices.

to adopt are so different from the provisions of the proposed rule that 
the original notice of proposed rulemaking did not fairly apprise the 
public of the issues ultimately to be resolved in the rulemaking or of 
the substance of the rule, the agency shall publish in the Federal 
Register a notice of the final rule the agency plans to adopt, together 
with the information relevant to such rule that is required by the 
applicable provisions of this section and that has not previously been 
published in the Federal Register. The agency shall allow a reasonable 
period for comment on such final rule.

agency shall give interested persons not less than 60 days to 
participate in the rulemaking through the submission of written data, 
views, or arguments.

        rulemaking;

        rulemaking through the Federal Register;

procedures in a rulemaking pursuant to this paragraph shall not be 
subject to judicial review.

Register not less than 60 days before the effective date of such rule. 
An agency may make a rule effective in less than 60 days after 
publication in the Federal Register if the rule grants or recognizes an 
exemption, relieves a restriction, or if the agency for good cause 
finds that such a delay in the effective date would be contrary to an 
important public interest and publishes such finding and an explanation

considering its future impact, the rule, interpretive rule, general 
statement of policy, or guidance is, or has the effect of, a major rule 
within the meaning of section 621(4), and its amendment or repeal is 
required to satisfy the decisional criteria of section 624, the agency 
shall grant the petition and shall, within one year, conduct a cost-
benefit analysis under chapter 6.
    ``(C) If, considering its future impact, the rule, interpretive 
rule, general statement of policy, or guidance does not satisfy the 
requirements of chapter 6, including the decisional criteria set forth 
in section 624, the agency shall take immediate action either to revoke 
or to amend the rule, interpretive rule, general statement of policy, 
or guidance to conform it to the requirements of chapter 6, including 
the decisional criteria in section 624.

this subsection, and give written notice of its determination to the 
petitioner, with reasonable promptness, but in no event later than 180 
days after the petition was received by the agency. The written notice 
of the agency's determination shall include an explanation of the 
determination and a response to each factual and legal claim that forms 
the basis of the petition. A decision to deny a petition shall be 
subject to judicial review immediately upon denial, as final agency 
action under the statute granting the agency authority to carry out its 
action.
    ``(5) Following a decision to grant or deny a petition to conduct a 
cost-benefit analysis for a rule, interpretive rule, general statement 
of policy, or guidance under this subsection, no further petition for 
such rule, interpretive rule, general statement of policy, or guidance, 
submitted by the same person, shall be considered by any agency unless 
such petition is based on a change in a fact, circumstance, or 
provision of law underlying or otherwise related to the rule, 
interpretive rule, general statement of policy, or guidance occurring 
since the initial petition was granted or denied, that warrants the 
amendment or repeal of the rule, interpretive rule, general statement 
of policy, or guidance.

proceeding conducted pursuant to this section and shall maintain a 
current index to such file. The file and the material excluded from the 
file pursuant to paragraph (4) shall constitute the rulemaking record

the file shall be made available to the public beginning on the date on 
which the agency makes an initial publication concerning the rule.

        or modification or revision of, such notice, and any advance 
        notice of proposed rulemaking;

        rulemaking, or that was submitted to or prepared by or for the 
        agency in connection with the rulemaking; and

available to the agency.

material that need not be made available to the public under section 
552(b)(4) if the agency includes in such file a statement that notes 
the existence of such material and the basis upon which the material is 
exempt from public disclosure under such section. The agency may not 
substantially rely on any such material in formulating a rule unless it 
makes the substance of such material available for adequate comment by 
interested persons. The agency may use summaries, aggregations of data, 
or other appropriate mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of such 
material to the maximum extent possible.
    ``(5) No court shall hold unlawful or set aside an agency rule 
because of a violation of this subsection unless the court finds that 
such violation has precluded fair public consideration of a material 
issue of the rulemaking taken as a whole. Judicial review of compliance 
or noncompliance with this subsection shall be limited to review of 
action or inaction on the part of an agency.
    ``(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section 
shall apply to and supplement the procedures governing rulemaking under 
statutes that are not generally subject to this section.

funds available to any agency to pay the attorney's fees or other 
expenses of persons participating or intervening in agency 
proceedings.''.

rule (or, in the case of a notice of a proposed rulemaking that has 
been published on or before the date of enactment of this subchapter, 
not later than 30 days after such date of enactment), each agency shall 
determine whether the rule is or is not a major rule within the meaning 
of section 621(4)(A)(i) and, if it is not, whether it should be 
designated a major rule under section 621(4)(A)(ii). For the purpose of 
any such determination or designation, a group of closely related rules 
shall be considered as one rule.

rule within the meaning of section 621(4)(A)(i) and has not designated 
the rule a major rule within the meaning of section 621(4)(A)(ii), the 
Director or a designee of the President may, as appropriate, determine 
that the rule is a major rule or designate the rule a major rule not 
later than 30 days after the publication of the notice of proposed 
rulemaking for the rule (or, in the case of a notice of proposed 
rulemaking that has been published on or before the date of enactment 
of this subchapter, not later than 60 days after such date of

providing an explanation sufficient to permit the agency to analyze 
such data or information. If any such data or information is gathered 
or explained by a person outside the agency, the agency shall

relevant agency, the Director, or a designee of the President to 
perform a cost-benefit analysis under this subchapter for the major 
rule, including a major rule in effect on the date of enactment of this 
subchapter for which a cost-benefit analysis pursuant to such 
subchapter has not been performed, regardless of whether a cost-benefit 
analysis was previously performed to meet requirements imposed before 
the date of enactment of this subchapter.

major rule to be reviewed and the amendment or repeal requested.

cost-benefit analysis for a rule under this subsection, no further

considered by any agency, the Director, or a designee of the President, 
unless such petition is based on a change in a fact, circumstance, or 
provision of law underlying or otherwise related to the rule occurring 
since the initial petition was granted or denied, that warrants the 
amendment or repeal of the rule.

or general statement of policy that would have the effect of a major 
rule if the interpretive rule, guidance, or general statement of policy 
had been adopted as a rule.

the interpretive rule, guidance, or general statement of policy would 
have the effect of a major rule if adopted as a rule.

promulgated within 2 years of granting a petition under subsection (d), 
the agency shall be prohibited from enforcing against any person the 
regulatory standards or criteria contained in such interpretive rule,

relevant agency to modify or waive the specific requirements of the

requirements for which the waiver is sought and the alternative means 
of compliance being proposed.

that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed alternative 
means of compliance would achieve the specific benefits of the major 
rule with an equivalent or greater level of protection of health, 
safety, and the environment than would be provided by the major rule, 
and would not impose an undue burden on the agency that would be 
responsible for enforcing such alternative means of compliance.

authority.

(c), the agency shall prepare a written explanation of why the agency 
was required to promulgate a rule with potential costs that were not 
justified by the potential benefits and shall transmit that explanation 
along with the final cost-benefit analysis to Congress when the final 
rule is promulgated.

    ``(a) Each court with jurisdiction to review final agency action 
under the statute granting the agency authority to conduct the 
rulemaking shall have jurisdiction to review final agency action under 
this subchapter.

concerning, a rule shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record 
of agency action for the purpose of judicial review and shall be 
considered by a court in determining the legality of the agency action, 
but only to the extent that it relates to the agency's decisional 
responsibilities under section 624 or the statute granting the agency 
authority to take the agency action.

judicial review separate or apart from judicial review of the agency

judicial review standards.

deadline would create an obligation to regulate through individual 
adjudications by another deadline, the deadline for such regulation

        scientific findings; and

        the maximum extent practicable.
    ``(2) An agency shall not be required to repeat discussions or 
explanations required under this section in each risk assessment 
document if there is an unambiguous reference to the relevant 
discussion or explanation in another reasonably available agency 
document that was prepared in accordance with this subchapter.
    ``(b) The principles to be applied when preparing risk assessments 
are as follows:
            ``(1)(A) When assessing human health risks, a risk 
        assessment shall consider and discuss both the most important 
        laboratory and epidemiological data, including negative data, 
        and summarize the remaining data that finds, or fails to find, 
        a correlation between a health risk and a substance or 
        activity.
            ``(B) When conflicts among such data appear to exist, or 
        when animal data are used as a basis to assess human health, 
        the assessment shall include a discussion of possible 
        reconciliation of conflicting information. Greatest emphasis 
        shall be placed on data that indicates the biological basis of 
        the resulting harm in humans. Animal data shall be reviewed 
        with regard to relevancy to humans.
            ``(2) When a risk assessment involves a choice of any 
        significant assumption (including the use of safety factors and 
        default assumptions), inference, or model, the agencies or 
        instrumentality preparing the assessment shall--
                    ``(A) present a representative description and 
                explicit explanation of plausible and alternative 
                similar assumptions, inferences, or models (including 
                the assumptions incorporated into the model) and the 
                sensitivity of the conclusions to them;
                    ``(B) give preference to the model, assumption, 
                input parameter that represents the most plausible or 
                realistic inference from supporting scientific 
                information;
                    ``(C) identify any science policy or value 
                judgments and employ those judgments only where the 
                policy determination has been approved by the head of 
                the agency, after notice and opportunity for public 
                involvement, as appropriate for the circumstance under 
                consideration;

                assessment and make explicit the assumptions

                model has been validated by, or conflicts with, 
                empirical data.
            ``(3) Risk assessments that provide a quantification or 
        numerical output shall be calculated using the best estimate 
        for each input parameter and shall use, as available, 
        probabilistic descriptions of the uncertainty and variability 
        associated with each input parameter.
            ``(4) A risk assessment shall clearly separate hazard 
        identification from risk characterization and make clear the 
        relationship between the level of risk and the level of 
        exposure to a potential hazard.

        detail appropriate and practicable for reasoned decisionmaking

        significance and complexity of the decision and any need for 
        expedition.

        shall be developed consistent with standards for the 
        development of test data promulgated pursuant to section 4 of 
        the Toxic Substances Control Act, and standards for data 
        requirements promulgated pursuant to section 3 of the Federal 
        Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.

meaningful public participation and comment on any risk assessment

        therefor; and

        affect agency decisionmaking.
    ``(d)(1) No agency shall automatically incorporate or adopt any 
recommendation or classification made by an entity described in 
paragraph (2) concerning the health effects or value of a substance 
without an opportunity for notice and comment. Any risk assessment or 
risk characterization document adopted by an agency on the basis of 
such a recommendation or classification shall comply with this title.

interpretation of the rule if the defendant relied upon an 
interpretation of the rule to the effect that the defendant was in 
compliance with or was exempt or otherwise not subject to the 
requirement of the rule, and the court determines that such 
determination is reasonable.

interpretation that the court determines is reasonable under paragraph 
(1), if the court determines that the rule failed to give the defendant 
fair warning of the conduct that the rule prohibits or requires, no 
civil or criminal penalty shall be imposed.

proceeding maintained, seeking the retroactive application of a
