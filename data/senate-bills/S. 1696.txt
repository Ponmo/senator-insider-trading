A BILL
To designate certain National Forest lands in the State of Montana as
wilderness, to release other National Forest lands in the State of Montana
for multiple use management, and for other purposes.
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
  States of America in Congress assembled,
 [Struck out->] SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   This Act may be referred to as the `Montana National Forest
 Management Act of 1991'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) Many areas of undeveloped National Forest System
 lands in the State of Montana possess outstanding natural characteristics
 which give them high value as wilderness and will, if properly preserved,
 contribute as an enduring resource of wild land for the benefit of the
 American people. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) The existing Department of Agriculture Land and Resource
 Management Plans for Forest System lands in the State of Montana have
 identified areas which, on the basis of their landform, ecosystem, associated
 wildlife, and location will help to fulfill the National Forest System's
 share of a quality National Wilderness Preservation System. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) The existing Department of Agriculture Land and
 Resource Management Plans for National Forest System lands in the State
 of Montana and the related congressional review of such lands have also
 identified areas that do not possess outstanding wilderness attributes or
 possess outstanding energy, mineral, timber, grazing, dispersed recreation,
 or other values. Such areas should not be designated as components of
 the National Wilderness Preservation System but should be available for
 non-wilderness multiple uses under the land management planning process
 and other applicable law. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (b) PURPOSES- The purposes of this Act are to-- [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) designate certain National Forest System lands in
 the State of Montana as components of the National Wilderness Preservation
 System, in furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131
 et seq.), in order to preserve the wilderness character of the land and
 to protect watersheds and wildlife habitat, preserve scenic and historic
 resources, and promote scientific research, primitive recreation, solitude,
 and physical and mental challenge; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) ensure that certain other National Forest System lands
 in the State of Montana be available for nonwilderness uses. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 3. WILDERNESS DESIGNATIONS. [<-Struck out]

 [Struck out->]   (c) ADMINISTRATION- Subject to valid existing rights,
 each wilderness area designated by this section shall be administered by the
 Secretary of Agriculture in accordance with the provisions of the Wilderness
 Act of 1964, except that, with respect to any area designated in this section,
 any reference to the effective date of the Wilderness Act shall be deemed
 to be a reference to the date of enactment of this Act. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (d) WILDERNESS AREA PERIMETERS- (1) Congress does not
 intend that the designation of a wilderness area in this section will lead
 to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around wilderness
 areas. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) That nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or
 heard from areas within a wilderness area should not, of itself, preclude such
 activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness area. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (e) GRAZING- The grazing of livestock, where established
 prior to the date of enactment of this Act, in wilderness areas designated
 in this section shall be administered in accordance with section 4(d)(4)
 of the Wilderness Act of 1964 and section 108 of an Act entitled `An Act to
 designate certain National Forest System Lands in the States of Colorado,
 South Dakota, Missouri, South Carolina, and Louisiana for inclusion in
 the National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other purposes'
 (94 Stat. 3271; 16 U.S.C. 1133 note). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (f) STATE FISH AND GAME AUTHORITY- In accordance with
 section 4(d)(7) of the Wilderness Act of 1964, nothing in this Act shall be
 construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of the State
 of Montana with respect to wildlife and fish in the national forests of
 Montana. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (g) HUNTING- Subject to applicable law, Congress recognizes
 hunting as a legitimate and beneficial activity within designated wilderness
 areas. Nothing in this Act or the Wilderness Act of 1964 shall be construed
 to prohibit hunting in wilderness areas. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (h) COLLECTION DEVICES- (1) Within the wilderness areas
 designated in this section, neither the Wilderness Act of 1964 or this
 Act shall be construed to prevent the installation and maintenance of
 hydrological, meteorological, or climatological collection devices and
 ancillary facilities subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems
 desirable, where such facilities or access are essential to flood warning,
 flood control, and water reservoir operation purposes. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) Access to the devices and facilities described in
 paragraph (1) shall be by the means historically used, if that method is
 the least intrusive practicable means available. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 4. WATER RIGHTS. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (a) FINDING- The Congress finds that the waters within
 the wilderness areas designated by section 3 of this Act are headwaters,

 rights as provided under Montana state law; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) is intended to affect the determination of expressed or
 implied reserved water rights as determined under other laws. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 5. RELEASE TO NON-WILDERNESS MULTIPLE USE. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) the Department of Agriculture has adequately met the
 wilderness study requirements of Public Law 94-557; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) the Land and Resource Management Plans and associated
 Environmental Impact Statements (hereinafter referred to as `Land and
 Resource Management Plans') for all the National Forests in the State of
 Montana have been completed as required by section 6 of the Forest and
 Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the
 National Forest Management Act of 1976; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) the Department of Agriculture, with substantial public
 input, has reviewed the wilderness potential of these and other areas; and
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (4) the Congress has made its own examination of National
 Forest System roadless areas in the State of Montana and of the environmental
 and economic impacts associated with alternative allocations of such
 areas. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (b) On the basis of such review, the Congress determines
 and directs that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) without otherwise passing on the question of the
 legal and factual sufficiency of the Land and Resource Management Plans and
 their associated environmental impact statements for National Forest System
 lands in the State of Montana completed prior to the enactment of this Act,
 prior to the revision of such plans' decisions to allocate roadless areas
 to wilderness or nonwilderness categories, and the environmental analyses
 directly related to such allocations shall not be subject to judicial review:
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (A) Provided, however, That, except for decisions allocating
 lands to wilderness and nonwilderness categories, nothing in this section
 shall preclude judicial review of Department of Agriculture decisions
 implementing such Plans or decisions made concerning the management of
 National Forest lands subsequent to their allocation to wilderness and
 nonwilderness categories: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (B) Provided further, That, except for decisions allocating
 lands to wilderness and nonwilderness categories, nothing in this section
 shall preclude judicial review of Forest Service regional guides and other
 departmental policies of general applicability, nor prevent a court from
 invalidating forest planning decisions which fail to comply with applicable
 law; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) except as specifically provided in sections 3, 6, 7,
 8, and 9 of this Act and in Public Law 95-150, with respect to the National
 Forest System lands in the State of Montana which were reviewed by the
 Department of Agriculture under Public Law 94-557, the unit plans that
 were in effect prior to completion of RARE II, the 1978 Forest Plan for the
 Beaverhead National Forest, and the Land and Resource Management Plans, that
 such reviews shall be deemed an adequate consideration of the suitability of
 such lands for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System,
 and the Department of Agriculture shall not be required to review the
 wilderness option prior to the revision of the Land and Resource Management
 Plans, but shall review the wilderness option when such plans are revised,
 which revisions will ordinarily occur on a ten-year cycle, or at least
 every fifteen years, unless prior to that time the Secretary finds that
 conditions in a unit have significantly changed; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) those National Forest System lands in the State of
 Montana referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection which were not
 designated wilderness, special management, or wilderness study areas shall
 be managed for multiple use in accordance with land and resource management
 plans pursuant to section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources
 Planning Act, as amended by the National Forest Management Act, and those
 areas need not be managed for the purpose of protecting their suitability
 for wilderness designation prior to or during revision of the initial Land
 and Resource Management Plans; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (4) if revised Land and Resource Management Plans for the
 National Forest System lands in the State of Montana are implemented pursuant
 to section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act,
 as amended by the National Forest Management Act and other applicable law,
 areas not recommended for wilderness designation need not be managed for the
 purpose of protecting their suitability for wilderness designation prior
 to or during revision of such plans, and areas recommended for wilderness
 designation shall be managed for the purpose of protecting their suitability
 for wilderness designation as may be required by the Forest and Rangeland
 Renewable Resources Planning Act, as amended by the National Forest Management
 Act, and other applicable law; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (5) unless expressly authorized by Congress, the Department
 of Agriculture shall not conduct any further statewide roadless area review
 and evaluation of National Forest System lands in the State of Montana for
 purposes of determining their suitability for inclusion in the National
 Wilderness Preservation System. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (c) As used in this section, and as provided in section 6
 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act, as amended by
 the National Forest Management Act, the term `revision' shall not include
 an amendment to a land and resource management plan. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (d) Except as where specifically provided elsewhere in
 this Act, the provisions of this section shall also apply to those National
 Forest System roadless lands in the State of Montana which are less than
 five thousand acres in size. [<-Struck out]

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
  This Act may be referred to as the `Montana National Forest Management
  Act of 1991'.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) Many areas of undeveloped National Forest System lands in the State
  of Montana possess outstanding natural characteristics which give them
  high value as wilderness and will, if properly preserved, contribute as
  an enduring resource of wild land for the benefit of the American people.
  (2) The existing Department of Agriculture Land and Resource Management
  Plans for Forest System lands in the State of Montana have identified areas
  which, on the basis of their landform, ecosystem, associated wildlife,
  and location will help to fulfill the National Forest System's share of
  a quality National Wilderness Preservation System.
  (3) The existing Department of Agriculture Land and Resource Management Plans
  for National Forest System lands in the State of Montana and the related
  congressional review of such lands have also identified areas that do not
  possess outstanding  wilderness attributes or possess outstanding energy,
  mineral, timber, grazing, dispersed recreation, or other values. Such
  areas should not be designated as components of the National Wilderness
  Preservation System but should be available for non-wilderness multiple
  uses under the land management planning process and other applicable law.
  (b) PURPOSES- The purposes of this Act are to--
  (1) designate certain National Forest System lands in the State of
  Montana as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System,
  in furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et
  seq.), in order to preserve the  wilderness character of the land and
  to protect watersheds and wildlife habitat, preserve scenic and historic
  resources, and promote scientific research, primitive recreation, solitude,
  and physical and mental challenge; and
  (2) ensure that certain other National Forest System lands in the State
  of Montana be available for nonwilderness uses.

  area designated by this section shall be administered by the Secretary of
  Agriculture in accordance with the provisions of the Wilderness Act of
  1964, except that, with respect to any area designated in this section,
  any reference to the effective date of the Wilderness Act shall be deemed
  to be a reference to the date of enactment of this Act.
  (d) WILDERNESS AREA PERIMETERS- Congress does not intend that the designation
  of wilderness areas in this section will lead to the creation of protective
  perimeters or buffer zones around such areas. The fact that nonwilderness
  activities or uses can be seen or heard from areas within a wilderness area
  shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary
  of the wilderness area.
  (e) GRAZING- The grazing of livestock, where established prior to the date
  of enactment of this Act, in wilderness areas designated in this section
  shall be administered in accordance with section 4(d)(4) of the Wilderness

  legitimate and beneficial activity within wilderness areas designated in
  this section. Nothing in this Act or the Wilderness Act of 1964 shall be
  construed to prohibit hunting in such areas.
  (h) COLLECTION DEVICES- (1) Within the wilderness areas designated in this
  section, neither the Wilderness Act of 1964 or this Act shall be construed
  to prevent the installation and maintenance of hydrological, meteorological,
  or climatological collection devices and ancillary facilities subject to
  such conditions as the Secretary deems desirable, where such facilities or
  access are essential to flood warning, flood control, and water reservoir
  operation purposes.
  (2) Access to the devices and facilities described in paragraph (1) shall
  be by the means historically used, if that method is the least intrusive
  practicable means available.
SEC. 4. WATER RIGHTS.
  (a) FINDING- The Congress finds that the waters within the wilderness areas
  designated by section 3 of this Act are headwaters, and accordingly, this
  Act has no effect on the appropriation or adjudication of waters within
  the State of Montana under applicable law.
  (b) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION- Nothing in this Act is intended or shall be
  construed:
  (1) to affect the downstream appropriation or adjudication of water;
  (2) to affect existing water rights as provided under Montana state law;
  (3) to affect the determination of express or implied reserved water rights
  as determined under other laws;
  (4) as establishing a precedent with regard to any future wilderness
  designations or any interpretation of any other Act or wilderness
  designation.
SEC. 5. RELEASE TO NONWILDERNESS MULTIPLE USE.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) the Department of Agriculture has adequately met the wilderness study
  requirements of Public Law 94-557;
  (2) the Land and Resource Management Plans and associated Environmental
  Impact Statements (hereinafter referred to as `Land and Resource Management
  Plans') for all the National Forests in the State of Montana have been
  completed as required by section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable
  Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management
  Act of 1976;
  (3) the Department of Agriculture, with substantial public input, has
  reviewed the wilderness potential of these and other areas; and
  (4) the Congress has made its own examination of National Forest System
  roadless areas in the State of Montana and of the environmental and economic
  impacts associated with alternative allocations of such areas.
  (b) On the basis of such review, the Congress determines and directs that--
  (1) without otherwise passing on the question of the legal and factual
  sufficiency of the Land and Resource Management Plans and their associated
  environmental impact statements for National Forest System lands in the
  State of Montana completed prior to the enactment of this Act, prior
  to the revision of such Plans, decisions to allocate roadless areas to
  wilderness or nonwilderness categories, and the environmental analyses
  directly related to such allocations shall not be subject to judicial review:
  (A) Provided, however, That, except for decisions allocating lands
  to wilderness and nonwilderness categories, nothing in this section
  shall preclude judicial review of Department of Agriculture decisions
  implementing such Plans or decisions made concerning the management of
  National Forest lands subsequent to their allocation to wilderness and
  nonwilderness categories:
  (B) Provided further, That, except for decisions allocating lands to
  wilderness and nonwilderness categories, nothing in this section shall
  preclude judicial review of Forest Service regional guides and other
  departmental policies of general applicability, nor prevent a court
  from invalidating forest planning decisions which fail to comply with
  applicable law;
  (2) except as specifically provided in sections 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of this
  Act and in Public Law 95-150, with respect to the National Forest System
  lands in the State of Montana which were reviewed by the Department of
  Agriculture under Public Law 94-557, the unit plans that were in effect
  prior to completion of RARE II, the 1978 Forest Plan for the Beaverhead
  National Forest, and the Land and Resource Management Plans, that such
  reviews shall be deemed an adequate consideration of the suitability of
  such lands for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System,
  and the Department of Agriculture shall not be required to review the
  wilderness option prior to the revision of the Land and Resource Management
  Plans, but shall review the wilderness option when such plans are revised,
  which revisions will ordinarily occur on a ten-year cycle, or at least
  every fifteen years, unless prior to that time the Secretary finds that
  conditions in a unit have significantly changed;
  (3) those National Forest System lands in the State of Montana referred to
  in paragraph (2) of this subsection which were not designated as wilderness,
  special management, national recreation or wilderness study areas by this
  Act shall be managed for multiple use in accordance with land and resource
  management plans pursuant to section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable
  Resources Planning Act, as amended by the National Forest Management Act,
  and those areas need not be managed for the purpose of protecting their
  suitability for wilderness designation prior to or during revision of the
  initial Land and Resource Management Plans;
  (4) if revised Land and Resource Management Plans for the National
  Forest System lands in the State of Montana are implemented pursuant to
  section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act,
  as amended by the National Forest Management Act and other applicable law,
  areas not recommended for wilderness designation need not be managed for
  the purpose of protecting their suitability for wilderness designation
  prior to or during revision of such plans, and areas recommended for
  wilderness designation shall be managed for the purpose of protecting
  their suitability  for wilderness designation as may be required by the
  Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act, as amended by the
  National Forest Management Act, and other applicable law; and
  (5) unless expressly authorized by Congress, the Department of Agriculture
  shall not conduct any further statewide roadless area review and evaluation
  of National Forest System lands in the State of Montana for purposes of
  determining their suitability for inclusion in the National Wilderness
  Preservation System.
  (c) As used in this section, and as provided in section 6 of the Forest
  and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act, as amended by the National
  Foreign Management Act, the term `revision' shall not include an amendment
  to a land and resource management plan.
  (d) Except as where specifically provided elsewhere in this Act, the
  provisions of this section shall also apply to those National Forest System
  roadless lands in the State of Montana which are less than five thousand
  acres in size.
  (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section,
  the requirements of Public Law 95-150 are deemed to be satisfied with
  respect to the Sapphire and Middle Fork of the Judith Wilderness study areas.

  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) underlying certain areas in Montana described in subsection (b) are
  mineral rights owned by subsidiaries of Burlington Resources, Incorporated
  (referred to in this section as the `company');
  (2) there are federally owned minerals underlying lands of the company
  lying outside those areas;
  (3) the company has agreed in principle with the Department of Agriculture
  to an exchange of mineral rights to consolidate surface and subsurface
  ownerships and to avoid potential conflicts with the surface management
  of such areas; and
  (4) it is desirable that an exchange be completed within two years after
  the date of enactment of this Act.
  (b) DESCRIPTION OF MINERAL INTERESTS- (1) Pursuant to an exchange agreement
  between the Secretary and the company, the Secretary may acquire mineral
  interests owned by the company or an affiliate of the company thereof
  underlying surface lands owned by the United States located in the areas
  depicted on the maps entitled `Severed Minerals Exchange, Clearwater-Monture
  Area', dated September 1988 and `Severed Minerals Exchanges, Gallatin Area',
  dated September 1988, or in fractional sections adjacent to those areas.
  (2) In exchange for the mineral interests conveyed to the Secretary
  pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Interior shall convey,
  subject to valid existing rights, such federally owned mineral interests
  as the Secretary and the company may agree upon.
  (c) EQUAL VALUE- (1) The value of mineral interests exchanged pursuant to
  this section shall be approximately equal based on available information.
  (2) To ensure that the wilderness or other natural values of the areas
  are not affected, a formal appraisal based upon drilling or other surface
  disturbing activities shall not be required for any mineral interest
  proposed for exchange, but the Secretary and the company shall fully share
  all available information on the quality and quantity of mineral interests
  proposed for exchange.
  (3) In the absence of adequate information regarding values of minerals
  proposed for exchange, the Secretary and the company may agree to an
  exchange on the basis of mineral interests of similar development potential,
  geologic character, and similar factors.
  (d) IDENTIFICATION OF FEDERALLY OWNED MINERAL INTERESTS- (1) Subject to
  paragraph (2), mineral interests conveyed by the United States pursuant
  to this section shall underlie lands the surface of which are owned by
  the company.
  (2) If there are not sufficient federally owned mineral interests of
  approximately equal value underlying company lands,  the Secretary and the
  Secretary of the Interior may identify for exchange any other federally
  owned mineral interest in land in the State of Montana of which the surface
  estate is in private ownership.
  (e) CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR- (1) The Secretary
  shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior in the negotiation of
  the exchange agreement authorized by subsection (b), particularly with
  respect to the inclusion in such an agreement of a provision calling
  for the exchange of federally owned mineral interests lying outside the
  boundaries of units of the National Forest System.
  (2) Notwithstanding any other law, the Secretary of the Interior shall
  convey the federally owned mineral interests identified in a final exchange
  agreement between the Secretary of Agriculture and the company and its
  affiliates.
  (f) DEFINITION- For purposes of this section, the term `mineral interests'
  includes all locatable and leasable minerals, including oil and gas,
  geothermal resources, and all other subsurface rights.
  (g) ENVIRONMENTAL LAW- The execution and performance of an exchange
  agreement and the taking of other actions pursuant to this section shall
  not be deemed a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
  of the environment within the meaning of section 102 of the National
  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332), nor shall they require
  the preparation of an environmental assessment under this Act.
