SEC. 924. INTEGRATION OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND 
              RECONNAISSANCE CAPABILITIES

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As part of transformation efforts within the Department 
        of Defense, each of the Armed Forces is developing 
        intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities 
        that best support future war fighting as envisioned by the 
        leadership of the military department concerned.
            (2) Concurrently, intelligence agencies of the Department 
        of Defense outside the military departments are developing 
        transformation roadmaps to best support the future 
        decisionmaking and war fighting needs of their principal 
        customers, but are not always closely coordinating those 
        efforts with the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
        development efforts of the military departments.
            (3) A senior official of each military department has been 
        designated as the integrator of intelligence, surveillance, and 
        reconnaissance for each of the Armed Forces in such military 
        department, but there is not currently a well-defined forum 
        where the integrators of intelligence, surveillance, and 
        reconnaissance capabilities for each of the Armed Forces can 
        routinely interact with each other and with senior 
        representatives of Department of Defense intelligence agencies, 
        as well as with other members of the intelligence community, to 
        ensure unity of effort and to preclude unnecessary duplication 
        of effort.
            (4) The current funding structure of a National Foreign 
        Intelligence Program (NFIP), Joint Military Intelligence 
        Program (JMIP), and Tactical Intelligence and Related 
        Activities Program (TIARA) might not be the best approach for 
        supporting the development of an intelligence, surveillance, 
        and reconnaissance structure that is integrated to meet the 
        national security requirements of the United States in the 21st 
        century.
            (5) The position of Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Intelligence was established in 2002 by Public Law 107-314 in 
        order to facilitate resolution of the challenges to achieving 
        an integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
        structure in the Department of Defense to meet such 21st 
        century requirements.
    (b) Goal.--It shall be a goal of the Department of Defense to fully 
coordinate and integrate the intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance capabilities and developmental activities of the 
military departments, intelligence agencies of the Department of 
Defense, and relevant combatant commands as those departments, 
agencies, and commands transform their intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance systems to meet current and future needs.
    (c) Requirement.--(1) The Under Secretary of Defense for 
Intelligence shall establish an Intelligence, Surveillance, and 
Reconnaissance Integration Council to provide a permanent forum for the 
discussion and arbitration of issues relating to the integration of 
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.
    (2) The Council shall be composed of the senior intelligence 
officers of the Armed Forces and the United States Special Operations 
Command, the Director of Operations of the Joint Staff, and the 
directors of the intelligence agencies of the Department of Defense.
    (3) The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence shall invite 
the participation of the Director of Central Intelligence or his 
representative in the proceedings of the Council.
    (d) ISR Integration Roadmap.--The Under Secretary of Defense for 
Intelligence, in consultation with the Intelligence, Surveillance, and 
Reconnaissance Integration Council and the Director of Central 
Intelligence, shall develop a comprehensive Defense Intelligence, 
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Integration Roadmap to guide the 
development and integration of the Department of Defense intelligence, 
surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities for 15 years.
    (e) Report.--(1) Not later than September 30, 2004, the Under 
Secretary of Defense for Intelligence shall submit to the committees of 
Congress specified in paragraph (2) a report on the Defense 
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Integration Roadmap 
developed under subsection (d). The report shall include the following 
matters:
            (A) The fundamental goals established in the roadmap.
            (B) An overview of the intelligence, surveillance, and 
        reconnaissance integration activities of the military 
        departments and the intelligence agencies of the Department of 
        Defense.
            (C) An investment strategy for achieving--
                    (i) an integration of Department of Defense 
                intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
                capabilities that ensures sustainment of needed 
                tactical and operational efforts; and
                    (ii) efficient investment in new intelligence, 
                surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.
            (D) A discussion of how intelligence gathered and analyzed 
        by the Department of Defense can enhance the role of the 
        Department of Defense in fulfilling its homeland security 
        responsibilities.
            (E) A discussion of how counterintelligence activities of 
        the Armed Forces and the Department of Defense intelligence 
        agencies can be better integrated.
            (F) Recommendations on how annual funding authorizations 
        and appropriations can be optimally structured to best support 
        the development of a fully integrated Department of Defense 
        intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance architecture.
    (2) The committees of Congress referred to in paragraph (1) are as 
follows:
            (A) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on 
        Appropriations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
        Senate.
            (B) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on 
        Appropriations, and the Permanent Select Committee on 
        Intelligence of the House of Representatives.

                       Subtitle D--Other Matters

SEC. 1031. BLUE FORCES TRACKING INITIATIVE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) For military commanders, a principal purpose of 
        technology is to enable the commanders to ascertain the 
        location of the units in their commands in near real time.
            (2) Each of the Armed Forces is developing and testing a 
        variety of technologies for tracking friendly forces (known as 
        ``blue forces'').
            (3) Situational awareness of blue forces has been much 
        improved since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, but blue forces 
        tracking remains a complex problem characterized by information 
        that is incomplete, not fully accurate, or untimely.
            (4) Casualties in recent warfare have declined, but 
        casualties associated with friendly fire incidents have 
        remained relatively constant.
            (5) Despite significant investment, a coordinated, 
        interoperable plan for tracking blue forces throughout a United 
        States or coalition forces theater of operations has not been 
        developed.
    (b) Goal.--It shall be a goal of the Department of Defense to fully 
coordinate the various efforts of the Joint Staff, the commanders of 
the combatant commands, and the military departments to develop an 
effective blue forces tracking system.
    (c) Joint Blue Forces Tracking Experiment.--(1) The Secretary of 
Defense, through the Commander of the United States Joint Forces 
Command, shall carry out a joint experiment in fiscal year 2004 to 
demonstrate and evaluate available joint blue forces tracking 
technologies.
    (2) The objectives of the experiment are as follows:
            (A) To explore various options for tracking United States 
        and other friendly forces during combat operations.
            (B) To determine an optimal, achievable, and ungradable 
        solution for the development, acquisition, and fielding of a 
        system for tracking all United States military forces that is 
        coordinated and interoperable and also accommodates the 
        participation of military forces of allied nations with United 
        States forces in combat operations.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the conclusion of the 
experiment under subsection (c), but not later than December 1, 2004, 
the Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense committees a 
report on the results of the experiment, together with a comprehensive 
plan for the development, acquisition, and fielding of a functional, 
near real time blue forces tracking system.

SEC. 1206. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE NATO PRAGUE CAPABILITIES COMMITMENT AND 
              THE NATO RESPONSE FORCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) At the meeting of the North Atlantic Council held in 
        Prague in November 2002, the heads of states and governments of 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) launched a Prague 
        Capabilities Commitment and decided to create a NATO Response 
        Force.
            (2) The Prague Capabilities Commitment is part of the 
        continuing NATO effort to improve and develop new military 
        capabilities for modern warfare in a high-threat environment. 
        As part of this commitment, individual NATO allies have made 
        firm and specific political commitments to improve their 
        capabilities in the areas of--
                    (A) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear 
                defense;
                    (B) intelligence, surveillance, and target 
                acquisition;
                    (C) air-to-ground surveillance;
                    (D) command, control, and communications;
                    (E) combat effectiveness, including precision 
                guided munitions and suppression of enemy air defenses;
                    (F) strategic air and sea lift;
                    (G) air-to-air refueling; and
                    (H) deployable combat support and combat service 
                support units.
            (3) The NATO Response Force is envisioned to be a 
        technologically advanced, flexible, deployable, interoperable, 
        and sustainable force that includes land, sea, and air elements 
        ready to move quickly to wherever needed, as determined by the 
        North Atlantic Council. The NATO Response Force is also 
        intended to be a catalyst for focusing and promoting 
        improvements in NATO's military capabilities. It is expected to 
        have initial operational capability by October 2004, and full 
        operational capability by October 2006.
    (b) Annual Report.--(1) Not later than January 31 of each year, the 
Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services 
and Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Armed 
Services and International Relations of the House of Representatives a 
report, to be prepared in consultation with the Secretary of State, on 
implementation of the Prague Capabilities Commitment and development of 
the NATO Response Force by the member nations of NATO. The report shall 
include the following matters:
            (A) A description of the actions taken by NATO as a whole 
        and by each member nation of NATO other than the United States 
        to further the Prague Capabilities Commitment, including any 
        actions taken to improve capability shortfalls in the areas 
        identified for improvement.
            (B) A description of the actions taken by NATO as a whole 
        and by each member nation of NATO, including the United States, 
        to create the NATO Response Force.
            (C) A discussion of the relationship between NATO's efforts 
        to improve capabilities through the Prague Capabilities 
        Commitment and those of the European Union to enhance European 
        capabilities through the European Capabilities Action Plan, 
        including the extent to which they are mutually reinforcing.
    (2) The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may 
also be submitted in classified form if necessary.
