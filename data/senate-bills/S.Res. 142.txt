S. Res. 142
In the Senate of the United States,
June 6 (legislative day, January 3), 1989.
Whereas since June 4, 1989, thousands of Chinese students and workers have
been killed and wounded by the People's Liberation Army in a brutal act of
armed suppression;
Whereas the Chinese people have bravely demonstrated their peaceful commitment
to democracy and human rights and, in so doing, have won the world's respect
and admiration; and
Whereas the authorities of the People's Republic of China have behaved in
a manner inconsistent with the civilized norms of the world's nations and
in contravention of the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration
on Human Rights which are accepted by all members of the United Nations
including China: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That (a) the Senate hereby--
  (1) condemns the brutal use of force by the authorities of the People's
  Republic of China against unarmed advocates of democracy and human rights
  in China and urges the entire international community to do likewise;
  (2) commends the President for his forthright statement of American policy
  and supports the actions taken by the President in pursuit of that policy,
  including suspension of all government sales and commercial exports of
  arms to the Government of the People's Republic of China; and
  (3) praises the courageous actions of American diplomatic personnel in China
  in seeking to insure the safety and well-being of American citizens there.
  (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--
  (1) the Chinese students currently studying in the United States, whose
  period of admission is expiring and whose return to China could subject
  them to conditions of violence or mistreatment, should immediately be
  granted permission to extend their stay in the United States until the
  Government of the People's Republic of China ceases the present persecution
  of students demonstrating for democracy in their country;
  (2) all applications to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)
  for the protection of investment in China and to the Export-Import Bank of
  the United States for the financing of trade with China should be reviewed
  in light of existing legal requirements for adequate human rights treatment
  and the deteriorating condition of human rights in China;
  (3) all departments and agencies of the United States Government charged
  with and currently considering liberalization of regulations and procedures
  relating to export licenses for sales to the People's Republic of China
  should take into account the current situation in China in making their
  decisions;
  (4) the President should immediately begin consultations with the major
  allies of the United States regarding each ally's economic, commercial,
  and security relations with the People's Republic of China in order to
  determine collectively whether multilateral sanctions are necessary to
  demonstrate abhorrence of the repressive actions by the authorities of
  the People's Republic of China against the people of China;
  (5) the President should inform the Congress of the results of his planned
  review of the bilateral relationship between the two countries and consult
  with the Congress on further actions to be taken based on unfolding events
  in China; and
  (6) the Voice of America should increase its daily Chinese language
  programming service for broadcast into the People's Republic of China
  beyond the number of daily programming hours broadcast as of June 6, 1989.
  SEC. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this resolution
  to the President.

Secretary.
