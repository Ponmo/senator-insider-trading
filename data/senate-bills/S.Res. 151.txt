SRES 151 ES1S
S. Res. 151
In the Senate of the United States,
June 22 (legislative day, January 3), 1989.
Whereas, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution lies at the
core of our Nation's concept of ordered liberty;
Whereas, the flag of the United States is the most profound symbol of our
ideals, aspirations, and indeed our identity as a Nation;
Whereas, the flag stands for our very being, including our commitments to
freedom, justice, equal opportunity, and peace;
Whereas, Americans have always displayed the flag as a living symbol of our
Nation and the values for which it stands;
Whereas, the burning of the American flag is an affront to our American
heritage and an affront to the American people;
Whereas, millions of Americans have fought valiantly, and many thousands
have died, to protect this sacred symbol of nationhood, from the beginning
of the Republic, through the two World Wars, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam
Conflict, to the present, and that those who risked and gave their lives for
our country are profoundly offended by the desecration of this sacred emblem;
Whereas, the Congress and forty-eight States have enacted laws to protect
against descration of the flag;
Whereas, the Senate expressed its respect for the flag as recently as March
16, 1989, when on a vote of 97-0, it passed S. 607, prohibiting the displaying
of the flag on the floor or ground;
Whereas, throughout the history of our Nation, the Supreme Court has properly
defended and protected the First Amendment rights of our Nation's citizens;
Whereas, the United States Supreme Court yesterday rendered a decision in
the case of Texas v. Johnson, No. 88-155, finding unconstitutional a Texas
statute prohibiting the desecration of the flag, determining that this
conduct was an act of `symbolic speech' protected by the First Amendment;
Whereas, the Congress has believed that the act of desecrating the flag is
clearly not `speech' as protected by the First Amendment; and that analogous
acts, such as desecrating a public monument such as the Lincoln Memorial,
would never be tolerated as speech; and
Whereas, it appears that yesterday's decision may invalidate the Federal
and State laws prohibiting desecration of the flag: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That the Senate hereby--
  (1) expresses its profound disappointment that the Texas statute prohibiting
  the desecration of the flag was found to be unconstitutional;
  (2) expresses its continued commitment to preserving the honor and integrity
  of the flag as a living symbol of our Nation and its aspirations and ideals;
  (3) intends to make an immediate study of the impact of yesterday's Supreme
  Court decision on Federal and State laws prohibiting the desecration of
  the flag, and to seek ways to restore sanctions against such reprehensible
  conduct; and
  (4) urges the American people to continue to display proudly the American
  flag as a symbol of our Nation and the values for which it stands.
Attest:
Secretary.
