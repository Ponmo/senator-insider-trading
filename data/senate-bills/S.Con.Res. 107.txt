  Affirming United States commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act.

Whereas at no time since the establishment of the People's Republic of China on 
        October 1, 1949, has Taiwan been under the control of the People's 
        Republic of China;
Whereas the United States began its long, peaceful, friendly relationship with 
        Taiwan in 1949;
Whereas since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the policy of 
        the United States has been based on the expectation that the future 
        relationship between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan would be 
        determined by peaceful means;
Whereas in March 1996, the People's Republic of China held provocative military 
        maneuvers, including missile launch exercises in the Taiwan Strait, in 
        an attempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan during their historic, 
        free and democratic presidential election;
Whereas officials of the People's Republic of China refuse to renounce the use 
        of force against democratic Taiwan;
Whereas Taiwan has achieved significant political and economic strength as one 
        of the world's premier democracies and as the nineteenth largest economy 
        in the world;
Whereas Taiwan is the seventh largest trading partner of the United States and 
        imports more than twice as much annually from the United States as does 
        the People's Republic of China; and
Whereas no treaties exist between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan that 
        determine the future status of Taiwan: Now therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) affirms its longstanding commitment to Taiwan and the 
        people of Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act 
        (Public Law 96-8);
            (2) affirms its expectation, consistent with the Taiwan 
        Relations Act, that the future of Taiwan will be determined by 
        peaceful means, and considers any effort to determine the 
        future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a threat to the 
        peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern 
        to the United States;
            (3) affirms its commitment, consistent with the Taiwan 
        Relations Act, to make available to Taiwan such defense 
        articles and defense services in such quantities as may be 
        necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
        defense capability;
            (4) affirms its commitment, consistent with the Taiwan 
        Relations Act, that only the President and Congress shall 
        determine the nature and quantity of defense articles and 
        services for Taiwan based solely upon their judgment of the 
        needs of Taiwan; and
            (5) urges the President of the United States to seek a 
        public renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any 
        use of force, or threat to use force, against democratic 
        Taiwan.

            Passed the Senate July 10, 1998.

            Attest:

                                                    GARY SISCO,

                                                             Secretary.
