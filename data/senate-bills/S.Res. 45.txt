                 Commemorating the Columbia astronauts.

Whereas the United States of America and the world mourn the seven astronauts 
        who perished aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003, as 
        they re-entered Earth's atmosphere at the conclusion of their 16-day 
        mission;
Whereas United States Air Force Colonel Rick D. Husband, Mission Commander; 
        United States Navy Commander William ``Willie'' McCool, Pilot; United 
        States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Michael P. Anderson, Payload 
        Commander/Mission Specialist; United States Navy Captain David M. Brown, 
        Mission Specialist; United States Navy Commander Laurel Blair Salton 
        Clark, Mission Specialist; Dr. Kalpana Chawla, Mission Specialist; and 
        Israeli Air Force Colonel Ilan Ramon, Payload Specialist were killed in 
        the line of duty during the 113th Space Shuttle Mission;
Whereas we stand in awe of the courage necessary to break the bonds of Earth and 
        venture into space, with full knowledge of the perils and complexities 
        inherent in such an endeavor;
Whereas the people of the United States and the world have enjoyed rich benefits 
        from the space program including technological advances in medicine, 
        communications, energy, agronomy, and astronomy;
Whereas we in the Congress of the United States recognize that curiosity, wonder 
        and the desire to improve life on Earth has inspired our exploration of 
        space and these traits epitomize the intrinsic dreams of the human race;
Whereas, despite these lofty goals, we realize that our reach for the stars will 
        never be without risk or peril, and setbacks will always be a part of 
        the human experience;
Whereas we recognize our solemn duty to devote our finest minds and resources 
        toward minimizing these risks and protecting the remarkable men and 
        women who are willing to risk their lives to serve mankind; and
Whereas we will always hold in our hearts the seven intrepid souls of Columbia, 
        as well as those explorers who perished before, including those aboard 
        Apollo I and the Space Shuttle Challenger: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the tragedy which befell the Space Shuttle Columbia 
        shall not dissuade or discourage this Nation from venturing 
        ever farther into the vastness of space;
            (2) today we restate our firm commitment to exploring the 
        planets and celestial bodies of our Solar System, and beyond;
            (3) we express our eternal sorrow and heartfelt condolences 
        to the families of the seven astronauts;
            (4) we convey our condolences to our friends and allies in 
        the state of Israel over the loss of Colonel Ilan Ramon, the 
        first Israeli in space;
            (5) we will never forget the sacrifices made by the seven 
        heroes aboard Columbia; and
            (6) we shall learn from this tragedy so that these 
        sacrifices shall not have been in vain.
                                 <all>
