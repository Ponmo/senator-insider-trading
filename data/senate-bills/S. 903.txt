 TITLE VII--FUNCTIONS, CONDUCT, AND STRUCTURE OF UNITED STATES FOREIGN 
                      POLICY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

SEC. 701. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has prevailed after a half-century of 
        Cold War and must now redesign diplomacy to meet the different 
        challenges of a new and changed international context.
            (2) The security of the United States requires that the 
        United States maintain an effective, professional diplomacy, 
        working in concert with the national intelligence and defense 
        forces of the United States.
            (3) With modern communications and accelerating 
        technological change, the world is ever more interdependent.
            (4) Because 30 percent of the United States gross domestic 
        product is trade-related and every one billion dollars of 
        United States exports represents 20,000 American jobs, national 
        prosperity requires assured access to foreign markets and our 
        diplomacy promotes and defends that access.
            (5) American consumers and American industry count upon the 
        availability of foreign goods and raw materials.
            (6) The new international agenda includes the following 
        pressing issues, which the Cold War diplomatic structure of the 
        United States is not framed to address adequately: intellectual 
        property rights, refugee migrations, runaway immigration, 
        ethnic conflict, narcotics, international terrorism, epidemic 
        disease, human rights, the advancement of democracy and of 
        market economic systems in developing countries, and a 
        hospitable natural environment.
            (7) The United States, as the one remaining global power, 
        must provide global leadership to address these issues that 
        affect Americans.
            (8) It is in the national interest to review the functions, 
        conduct, and structure of United States foreign policy for the 
        21st century.

SEC. 702. ESTABLISHMENT.

    There is established a commission to be known as the Commission on

        foreign affairs policies of the United States organized most 
        effectively to achieve its aims, particularly with respect to

        strategy?
            (3) What are the implications for the functions, resources, 
        and structures of the foreign affairs agencies of the United 
        States of fundamental changes in the international environment, 
        especially advances in information technology, economic

        Government of adequate size, properly distributed, and 
        supported with sufficient resources to advocate effectively the 
        national interests, values, and principles of the United 
        States?
            (5) Are the foreign affairs agencies structured to best 
        advance the national interests, values, and principles of the 
        United States?
            (6) Do the current personnel systems of the foreign affairs

                States.
                    (C) Each case in which the United States has 
                certified that a person enjoys full immunity from the

        extending diplomatic privileges and immunities; and
            (2) to provide that where there is probable cause to

        criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state under laws 
        extending diplomatic privileges and immunities committed a 
        serious crime, the sending state will waive such immunity or 
        the sending state will prosecute such individual.

SEC. 1611. ITALIAN CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY CASE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States and the Italian Republic signed the 
        Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation in 1948.
            (2) Article V, paragraph 2 of the Treaty states that 
        property owned by nationals of either treaty partner shall not 
        be taken without ``due process of law and without the prompt 
        payment of just and effective compensation.''.
            (3) The Italian Republic confiscated the property of an 
        American citizen, Mr. Pier Talenti, and has failed to 
        compensate Mr. Talenti for his property.
            (4) The failure of the Italian government to compensate Mr. 
        Talenti runs counter to its treaty obligations and accepted 
        international standards.
            (5) Mr. Talenti has exhausted all remedies available to him 
        within the Italian judicial system.
            (6) To date, Mr. Talenti has not received ``just and 
        effective compensation'' from the Italian government as called 
        for in the Treaty.
            (7) In view of the inability of Mr. Talenti to obtain any 
        recourse within the Italian judicial system, on August 5, 1996, 
        the Department of State agreed to espouse Mr. Talenti's claim 
        and formally urged the Italian government to reach a settlement 
        with Mr. Talenti.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Italian Republic must honor its Treaty obligations with regard to the 
confiscated property of Mr. Pier Talenti by negotiating a prompt 
resolution of Mr. Talenti's case, and that the Department of State 
should continue to press the Italian government to resolve Mr. 
Talenti's claim.

    The President shall withhold from disbursement for any United 
Nations peace operation established after the date of enactment of this

serves an important national security interest of the United States.

SEC. 2107. UNITED STATES POLICY REGARDING UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING 
              MISSIONS.

    It shall be the policy of the United States--
            (1) to ensure that major peacekeeping operations (in 
        general, those comprised of more than 10,000 troops) authorized 
        by the United Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the 
        United Nations Charter (or missions such as the United Nations 
        Protection Force (UNPROFOR)) are undertaken by a competent 
        regional organization such as NATO or a multinational force, 
        and not established as a peacekeeping operation under United 
        Nations operational control which would be paid for by 
        assessment of United Nations members; and
            (2) to consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether it is in 
        the national interest of the United States to agree that 
        smaller peacekeeping operations authorized by the United 
        Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the United 
        Nations Charter and paid for by assessment of United Nations 
        members (such as the United Nations Transitional Authority in 
        Slavonia (UNTAES)) should be established as peacekeeping 
        operations under United Nations operational control which would 
        be paid for by assessment of United Nations members.

SEC. 2108. ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES.

    Taking into consideration the long-term commitment by the United 
States to the affairs of this hemisphere and the need to build further 
upon the linkages between the United States and its neighbors, it is 
the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State should make every 
effort to pay the United States assessed funding levels for the 
Organization of American States, which is uniquely dependent on United 
States contributions and is continuing fundamental reforms in its 
structure and its agenda.
