SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) safe drinking water is essential to the protection of 
        public health;
            (2) the Federal Government needs to assist communities in 
        the financing of drinking water treatment and related projects;
            (3) small drinking water systems need additional technical 
        assistance and information from State and Federal agencies to 
        ensure the provision of safe and affordable drinking water;
            (4) the existing process for the assessment and regulation 
        of additional drinking water contaminants needs to be improved 
        and revised to provide for more extensive participation from 
        interested parties and to strengthen the scientific basis for 
        drinking water regulations;
            (5) States play a central role in the implementation of 
        safe drinking water programs and States need increased 
        financial resources to ensure the prompt and effective 
        development and implementation of drinking water programs; and
            (6) there is substantial noncompliance with requirements of 
        the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) and 
        Federal and State agencies need more effective authorities to 
        ensure the implementation of the Act.

SEC. 3. STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS.

    (a) Establishment of State Loan Funds.--The title (42 U.S.C. 300f 
et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new part:

                  ``PART G--STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS

                          ``general authority

Administrator shall offer to enter into an agreement with each State to 
make capitalization grants to the State pursuant to section 1472

drinking water treatment State revolving loan fund (referred to in this 
part as a `State loan fund').
    ``(b) Requirements of Agreements.--An agreement entered into 
pursuant to this section shall establish, to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that--

            ``(2) the State loan fund will be administered by an 
        instrumentality of the State that has the powers and 
        authorities that are required to operate the State loan fund in 
        accordance with this part;
            ``(3) the State will deposit the capitalization grants into 
        the State loan fund;
            ``(4) the State will deposit all loan repayments received, 
        and interest earned on the amounts deposited into the State 
        loan fund under this part, into the State loan fund;
            ``(5) the State will deposit into the State loan fund an 
        amount equal to at least 20 percent of the total amount of each 
        payment to be made to the State on or before the date on which 
        the payment is made to the State, except as provided in 
        subsection (c)(4);
            ``(6) the State will use funds in the State loan fund in 
        accordance with an intended use plan prepared pursuant to 
        section 1474(b);
            ``(7) the State and loan recipients that receive funds that 
        the State makes available from the State loan fund will use 
        accounting, audit, and fiscal procedures that conform to 
        generally accepted accounting standards, as determined by the 
        Administrator; and
            ``(8) the State has adopted policies and procedures to 
        ensure that loan recipients are reasonably likely to be able to 
        repay a loan.

        priorities for financial assistance provided with amounts 
        deposited into the State loan fund shall remain with the State 
        agency that has primary responsibility for the administration 
        of the State program pursuant to section 1413(a), after 
        consultation with other appropriate State agencies.
            ``(2) Financial administration.--A State may combine the 
        financial administration of the State loan fund pursuant to 
        this part with the financial administration of a State water 
        pollution control revolving fund established by the State 
        pursuant to title VI of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
        (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) or other State revolving funds 
        providing financing for similar purposes if the Administrator 
        determines that the grants to be provided to the State under 
        this part, together with loan repayments and interest deposited 
        into the State loan fund pursuant to this part, will be 
        separately accounted for and used solely for the purposes of 
        and in compliance with the requirements specified in this part.

                capitalization grant required pursuant to this title or 
                the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251

    (a) Small System Variances.--
            (1) In general.--Section 1415 (42 U.S.C. 300g-4) is amended 
        by adding at the end the following new subsection:

            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator, or a State with 
        primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems 
        under section 1413, may grant to a public water system serving 
        a population of 10,000 or less (referred to in this subsection 
        as a `small system') a variance under this subsection for 
        compliance with a requirement specifying a maximum contaminant 
        level or treatment technique contained in a national primary 
        drinking water regulation, if the variance meets all the 
        requirements of this subsection.

        receive a variance under this subsection if the system 
        installs, operates, and maintains, in accordance with guidance 
        or regulations issued by the Administrator, treatment 
        technology that is feasible for small systems as determined by 
        the Administrator pursuant to section 1412(b)(12).

                system and the removal efficiencies and expected useful 
                life of the treatment technology required by the 
                variance.

                enforcement action under section 1414 for a violation 
                of a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique 
                in the national primary drinking water regulation with

children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of 
serious illness, or other subpopulations that can be identified and 
characterized are likely to experience elevated health risks, including 
risks of cancer, from contaminants in drinking water. In characterizing 
the health effects of drinking water contaminants under this Act, the 
Administrator shall take into account all relevant factors, including 
the margin of safety for variability in the general population and the 
results of research required under this subsection and other sound 
scientific evidence (including the 1993 and 1994 reports of the 
National Academy of Sciences) regarding subpopulations at greater risk

                representative of the Administrator may waive the 
                requirements of subparagraphs (A) or (B) if the 
                Administrator or authorized representative of the 
                Administrator determines that it may be necessary to 
                conduct an inspection to protect public health.
    ``(c) Compliance.--Any person, who is subject to any requirement of 
this title (including a person that the Administrator determines may be 
subject to a requirement of this title), shall--
            ``(1) comply with the requirements of subsection (a);

SEC. 15. ASSESSING ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES, COSTS, AND BENEFITS.

    (a) Definitions.--As used in this section:
            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
            (2) Adverse effect on human health.--The term ``adverse 
        effect on human health'' includes any increase in the rate of 
        death or serious illness, including disease, cancer, birth 
        defects, reproductive dysfunction, developmental effects 
        (including effects on the endocrine and nervous systems), and 
        other impairments in bodily functions.
            (3) Risk.--The term ``risk'' means the likelihood of an 
        occurrence of an adverse effect on human health, the 
        environment, or public welfare.
            (4) Source of pollution.--The term ``source of pollution'' 
        means a category or class of facilities or activities that 
        alter the chemical, physical, or biological character of the 
        natural environment.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful 
        but imperfect tools that serve to enhance the information 
        available in developing environmental regulations and programs;
            (2) cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment can also 
        serve as useful tools in setting priorities and evaluating the 
        success of environmental protection programs;
            (3) cost and risk are not the only factors that need to be 
        considered in evaluating environmental programs as other 
        factors, including values and equity, must also be considered;
            (4) cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment should be 
        presented with a clear statement of the uncertainties in the 
        analysis or assessment;
            (5) current methods for valuing ecological resources and 
        assessing intergenerational effects of sources of pollution 
        need further development before integrated rankings of sources 
        of pollution based on the factors referred to in paragraph (3) 
        can be used with high levels of confidence;
            (6) methods to assess and describe the risks of adverse 
        human health effects, other than cancer, need further 
        development before integrated rankings of sources of pollution 
        based on the risk to human health can be used with high levels 
        of confidence;
            (7) periodic reports by the Administrator on the costs and 
        benefits of regulations promulgated under Federal environmental 
        laws, and other Federal actions with impacts on human health, 
        the environment, or public welfare, will provide Congress and 
        the general public with a better understanding of--
                    (A) national environmental priorities; and
                    (B) expenditures being made to achieve reductions 
                in risk to human health, the environment, and public 
                welfare; and
            (8) periodic reports by the Administrator on the costs and 
        benefits of environmental regulations will also--
                    (A) provide Congress and the general public with a 
                better understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and 
                uncertainties of cost-benefit analysis and risk 
                assessment and the research needed to reduce major 
                uncertainties; and
                    (B) assist Congress and the general public in 
                evaluating environmental protection regulations and 
                programs, and other Federal actions with impacts on 
                human health, the environment, or public welfare, to 
                determine the extent to which the regulations, 
                programs, and actions adequately and fairly protect 
                affected segments of society.
    (c) Report on Environmental Priorities, Costs, and Benefits.--
            (1) Ranking.--
                    (A) In general.--The Administrator shall identify 
                and, taking into account available data, to the extent 
                practicable, rank sources of pollution with respect to 
                the relative degree of risk of adverse effects on human 
                health, the environment, and public welfare.
                    (B) Method of ranking.--In carrying out the 
                rankings under subparagraph (A), the Administrator 
                shall--
                            (i) rank the sources of pollution 
                        considering the extent and duration of the 
                        risk; and
                            (ii) take into account broad societal 
                        values, including the role of natural resources 
                        in sustaining economic activity into the 
                        future.
            (2) Evaluation of regulatory and other costs.--In addition 
        to carrying out the rankings under paragraph (1), the 
        Administrator shall estimate the private and public costs 
        associated with each source of pollution and the costs and 
        benefits of complying with regulations designed to protect 
        against risks associated with the sources of pollution; and
            (3) Evaluation of other federal actions.--In addition to 
        carrying out the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2), the 
        Administrator shall also estimate the private and public costs 
        and benefits associated with selected major Federal actions 
        chosen by the Administrator that have the most significant 
        impact on human health or the environment, including the direct 
        development projects, grant and loan programs to support 
        infrastructure construction and repair, and permits, licenses, 
        and leases to use natural resources or to release pollution to 
        the environment, and other similar actions.
            (4) Risk reduction opportunities.--In assessing risks, 
        costs, and benefits as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), the 
        Administrator shall also identify reasonable opportunities to 
        achieve significant risk reduction through modifications in 
        environmental regulations and programs and other Federal 
        actions with impacts on human health, the environment, or 
        public welfare.
            (5) Uncertainties.--In evaluating the risks referred to in 
        paragraphs (1) and (2), the Administrator shall--
                    (A) identify the major uncertainties associated 
                with the risks;
                    (B) explain the meaning of the uncertainties in 
                terms of interpreting the ranking and evaluation; and
                    (C) determine--
                            (i) the type and nature of research that 
                        would likely reduce the uncertainties; and
                            (ii) the cost of conducting the research.
            (6) Consideration of benefits.--In carrying out this 
        section, the Administrator shall consider and, to the extent 
        practicable, estimate the monetary value, and such other values 
        as the Administrator determines to be appropriate, of the 
        benefits associated with reducing risk to human health and the 
        environment, including--
                    (A) avoiding premature mortality;
                    (B) avoiding cancer and noncancer diseases that 
                reduce the quality of life;
                    (C) preserving biological diversity and the 
                sustainability of ecological resources;
                    (D) maintaining an aesthetically pleasing 
                environment;
                    (E) valuing services performed by ecosystems (such 
                as flood mitigation, provision of food or material, or 
                regulating the chemistry of the air or water) that, if 
                lost or degraded, would have to be replaced by 
                technology;
                    (F) avoiding other risks identified by the 
                Administrator; and
                    (G) considering the benefits even if it is not 
                possible to estimate the monetary value of the benefits 
                in exact terms.
            (7) Reports.--
                    (A) Preliminary report.--Not later than 1 year 
                after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
                Administrator shall report to Congress on the sources 
                of pollution and other Federal actions that the 
                Administrator will address, and the approaches and 
                methodology the Administrator will use, in carrying out 
                the rankings and evaluations under this section. The 
                report shall also include an evaluation by the 
                Administrator of the need for the development of 
                methodologies to carry out the ranking.
                    (B) Periodic report.--
                            (i) In general.--On completion of the 
                        ranking and evaluations conducted by the 
                        Administrator under this section, but not later 
                        than 3 years after the date of enactment of 
                        this Act, and every 3 years thereafter, the 
                        Administrator shall report the findings of the 
                        rankings and evaluations to Congress and make 
                        the report available to the general public.
                            (ii) Evaluation of risks.--Each periodic 
                        report prepared pursuant to this subparagraph 
                        shall, to the extent practicable, evaluate risk 
                        management decisions under Federal 
                        environmental laws, including title XIV of the 
                        Public Health Service Act (commonly known as 
                        the ``Safe Drinking Water Act'') (42 U.S.C. 
                        300f et seq.), that present inherent and 
                        unavoidable choices between competing risks, 
                        including risks of controlling microbial versus 
                        disinfection contaminants in drinking water. 
                        Each periodic report shall address the policy 
                        of the Administrator concerning the most 
                        appropriate methods of weighing and analyzing 
                        the risks, and shall incorporate information 
                        concerning--
                                    (I) the severity and certainty of 
                                any adverse effect on human health, the 
                                environment, or public welfare;
                                    (II) whether the effect is 
                                immediate or delayed;
                                    (III) whether the burden associated 
                                with the adverse effect is borne 
                                disproportionately by a segment of the 
                                general population or spread evenly 
                                across the general population; and
                                    (IV) whether a threatened adverse 
                                effect can be eliminated or remedied by 
                                the use of an alternative technology or 
                                a protection mechanism.
    (d) Implementation.--In carrying out this section, the 
Administrator shall--
            (1) consult with the appropriate officials of other Federal 
        agencies and State and local governments, members of the 
        academic community, representatives of regulated businesses and 
        industry, representatives of citizen groups, and other 
        knowledgeable individuals to develop, evaluate, and interpret 
        scientific and economic information;
            (2) make available to the general public the information on 
        which rankings and evaluations under this section are based; 
        and
            (3) establish, not later than 24 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, methods for determining costs and 
        benefits of environmental regulations and other Federal 
        actions, including the valuation of natural resources and 
        intergenerational costs and benefits, by rule after notice and 
        opportunity for public comment.
    (e) Review by the Science Advisory Board.--Before the Administrator 
submits a report prepared under this section to Congress, the Science 
Advisory Board, established by section 8 of the Environmental Research, 
Development, and Demonstration Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 4365), shall 
conduct a technical review of the report in a public session.

SEC. 16. BOTTLED DRINKING WATER STANDARDS.

    Section 410 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
349) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``Whenever'' and inserting ``(a) Except as 
        provided in subsection (b), whenever''; and
            (2) by adding at the end following new subsection:
    ``(b)(1) After the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency publishes a proposed maximum contaminant level, but not later 
than 180 days after the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency publishes a final maximum contaminant level, for a contaminant 
under section 1412 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-1), 
the Secretary, after public notice and comment, shall issue a 
regulation that establishes a quality level for the contaminant in

protect the public health because the contaminant is contained in water 
in the public water systems (as defined under section 1401(4) of such 
Act (42 U.S.C. 300f(4)) and not in water used for bottled drinking 
water.
    ``(2) The regulation shall include any monitoring requirements that 
the Secretary determines appropriate for bottled water.
    ``(3) The regulation--
            ``(A) shall require that the quality level for the 
        contaminant in bottled water be as stringent as the maximum 
        contaminant level for the contaminant published by the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; and
            ``(B) may require that the quality level be more stringent 
        than the maximum contaminant level if necessary to provide 
        ample public health protection under this Act.
    ``(4)(A) If the Secretary fails to establish a regulation within 
the 180-day period described in paragraph (1), the regulation with 
respect to the final maximum contaminant level published by the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (as described in 
such paragraph) shall be considered, as of the date on which the 
Secretary is required to establish a regulation under paragraph (1), as 
the final regulation for the establishment of the quality level for a 
contaminant required under paragraph (1) for the purpose of 
establishing or amending a bottled water quality level standard with 
respect to the contaminant.
    ``(B) Not later than 30 days after the end of the 180-day period 
described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, with respect to a 
maximum contaminant level that is considered as a quality level under 
subparagraph (A), publish a notice in the Federal Register that sets 
forth the quality level and appropriate monitoring requirements 
required under paragraphs (1) and (2) and that provides that the 
quality level standard and requirements shall take effect on the date 
on which the final regulation of the maximum contaminant level takes 
effect.''.

SEC. 18. RISK ASSESSMENT AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.

    (a) Requirement.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in 
promulgating any proposed or final major regulation relating to human 
health or the environment, the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency shall publish in the Federal Register along with the 
regulation a clear and concise statement that--
            (1) describes and, to the extent practicable, quantifies 
        the risks to human health or the environment to be addressed by 
        the regulation (including, where applicable and practicable, 
        the human health risks to significant subpopulations who are 
        disproportionately exposed or particularly sensitive);
            (2) compares the human health or environmental risks to be 
        addressed by the regulation to other risks chosen by the 
        Administrator, including--
                    (A) at least three other risks regulated by the 
                Environmental Protection Agency or another Federal 
                agency; and
                    (B) at least three other risks that are not 
                directly regulated by the Federal Government;
            (3) estimates--
                    (A) the costs to the United States Government, 
                State and local governments, and the private sector of 
                implementing and complying with the regulation; and
                    (B) the benefits of the regulation;
        including both quantifiable measures of costs and benefits, to 
        the fullest extent that they can be estimated, and qualitative 
        measures that are difficult to quantify; and
            (4) contains a certification by the Administrator that--
                    (A) the analyses performed under subsection (a)(1) 
                through (a)(3) are based on the best reasonably 
                obtainable scientific information;
                    (B) the regulation is likely to significantly 
                reduce the human health or environmental risks to be 
                addressed;
                    (C) there is no regulatory alternative that is 
                allowed by the statute under which the regulation is 
                promulgated and that would achieve an equivalent 
                reduction in risk in a more cost-effective manner, 
                along with a brief explanation of why other such 
                regulatory alternatives that were considered by the 
                Administrator were found to be less cost-effective; and
                    (D) the regulation is likely to produce benefits to 
                human health or the environment that will justify the 
                costs to the United States Government, State and local 
                governments, and the private sector of implementing and 
                complying with the regulation.
    (b) Substantially Similar Final Regulations.--If the Administrator 
determines that a final major regulation is substantially similar to 
the proposed version of the regulation with respect to each of the 
matters referred to in subsection (a), the Administrator may publish in 
the Federal Register a reference to the statement published under 
subsection (a) for the proposed regulation in lieu of publishing a new 
statement for the final regulation.
    (c) Reporting.--If the Administrator cannot certify with respect to 
one or more of the matters addressed in subsection (a)(4), the 
Administrator shall identify those matters for which certification 
cannot be made, and shall include a statement of the reasons therefor 
in the Federal Register along with the regulation. Not later than March 
1 of each year, the Administrator shall submit a report to Congress 
identifying those major regulations promulgated during the previous 
calendar year for which complete certification was not made, and 
summarizing the reasons therefor.
    (d) Other Requirements.--Nothing in this section affects any other 
provision of Federal law, or changes the factors that the Administrator 
is authorized to consider in promulgating a regulation pursuant to any 
statute, or shall delay any action required to meet a deadline imposed 
by statute or a court.
    (e) Judicial Review.--Nothing in this section creates any right to 
judicial or administrative review, nor creates any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law of equity by a party 
against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its 
officers or employees, or any other person. If a major regulation is 
subject to judicial or administrative review under any other provision 
of law, the adequacy of the certification prepared pursuant to this 
section, and any alleged failure to comply with this section, may not 
be used as grounds for affecting or invalidating such major regulation, 
although the statements and information prepared pursuant to this 
section, including statements contained in the certification, may be 
considered as part of the record for judicial or administrative review 
conducted under such other provision of law.
    (f) Definition of Major Regulation.--For purposes of this section, 
``major regulation'' means a regulation that the Administrator 
determines may have an effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more in 
any one year.
    (g) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect 180 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 19. PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Private 
Property Rights Act of 1994''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the protection of private property from a taking by the 
        Government without just compensation is an integral protection 
        for private citizens incorporated into the Constitution by the 
        Fifth Amendment and made applicable to the States by the 
        Fourteenth Amendment; and
            (2) Federal agencies should take into consideration the 
        impact of Governmental actions on the use and ownership of 
        private property.
    (c) Purpose.--The Congress, recognizing the important role that the 
use and ownership of private property plays in ensuring the economic 
and social well-being of the Nation, declares that the Federal 
Government should protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public 
and, in doing so, to the extent practicable, avoid takings of private 
property.
    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            (1) the term ``agency'' means an Executive agency as 
        defined under section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and--
                    (A) includes the United States Postal Service; and
                    (B) does not include the General Accounting Office; 
                and
            (2) the term ``taking of private property'' means any 
        action whereby private property is taken in such a way as to 
        require compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the United 
        States Constitution.
    (e) Private Property Taking Impact Analysis.--
            (1) In general.--The Congress authorizes and directs that, 
        to the fullest extent possible--
                    (A) the policies, regulations, and public laws of 
                the United States shall be interpreted and administered 
                in accordance with the policies under this section; and
                    (B) all agencies of the Federal Government shall 
                complete a private property taking impact analysis 
                before issuing or promulgating any policy, regulation, 
                proposed legislation, or related agency action which is 
                likely to result in a taking of private property, 
                except that--
                            (i) this subparagraph shall not apply to--
                                    (I) an action in which the power of 
                                eminent domain is formally exercised;
                                    (II) an action taken--
                                            (aa) with respect to 
                                        property held in trust by the 
                                        United States; or
                                            (bb) in preparation for, or 
                                        in connection with, treaty 
                                        negotiations with foreign 
                                        nations;
                                    (III) a law enforcement action, 
                                including seizure, for a violation of 
                                law, of property for forfeiture or as 
                                evidence in a criminal proceeding;
                                    (IV) a study or similar effort or 
                                planning activity;
                                    (V) a communication between an 
                                agency and a State or local land-use 
                                planning agency concerning a planned or 
                                proposed State or local activity that 
                                regulates private property, regardless 
                                of whether the communication is 
                                initiated by an agency or is undertaken 
                                in response to an invitation by the 
                                State or local authority;
                                    (VI) the placement of a military 
                                facility or a military activity 
                                involving the use of solely Federal 
                                property; and
                                    (VII) any military or foreign 
                                affairs function (including a 
                                procurement function under a military 
                                or foreign affairs function), but not 
                                including the civil works program of 
                                the Army Corps of Engineers; and
                            (ii) in a case in which there is an 
                        immediate threat to health or safety that 
                        constitutes an emergency requiring immediate 
                        response or the issuance of a regulation 
                        pursuant to section 553(b)(B) of title 5, 
                        United States Code, the taking impact analysis 
                        may be completed after the emergency action is 
                        carried out or the regulation is published.
            (2) Content of analysis.--A private property taking impact 
        analysis shall be a written statement that includes--
                    (A) the specific purpose of the policy, regulation, 
                proposal, recommendation, or related agency action;
                    (B) an assessment of the likelihood that a taking 
                of private property will occur under such policy, 
                regulation, proposal, recommendation, or related agency 
                action;
                    (C) an evaluation of whether such policy, 
                regulation, proposal, recommendation, or related agency 
                action is likely to require compensation to private 
                property owners;
                    (D) alternatives to the policy, regulation, 
                proposal, recommendation, or related agency action that 
                would achieve the intended purposes of the agency 
                action and lessen the likelihood that a taking of 
                private property will occur; and
                    (E) an estimate of the potential liability of the 
                Federal Government if the Government is required to 
                compensate a private property owner.
            (3) Submission to omb.--Each agency shall provide an 
        analysis required by this section as part of any submission 
        otherwise required to be made to the Office of Management and 
        Budget in conjunction with the proposed regulation.
    (f) Guidance and Reporting Requirements.--
            (1) Guidance.--The Attorney General shall provide legal 
        guidance in a timely manner, in response to a request by an 
        agency, to assist the agency in complying with this section.
            (2) Reporting.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act and at the end of each 1-year period 
        thereafter, each agency shall provide a report to the Director 
        of the Office of Management and Budget and the Attorney General 
        identifying each agency action that has resulted in the 
        preparation of a taking impact analysis, the filing of a taking 
        claim, or an award of compensation pursuant to the Just 
        Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. 
        The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the 
        Attorney General shall publish in the Federal Register, on an 
        annual basis, a compilation of the reports of all agencies made 
        pursuant to this paragraph.
    (g) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to--
            (1) limit any right or remedy, or bar any claim of any 
        person relating to such person's property under any other law, 
        including claims made under section 1346 or 1402 of title 28, 
        United States Code, or chapter 91 of title 28, United States 
        Code; or
            (2) constitute a conclusive determination of the value of 
        any property for purposes of an appraisal for the acquisition 
        of property, or for the determination of damages.
    (h) Statute of Limitations.--No action may be filed in a court of 
the United States to enforce the provisions of this section on or after 
the date occurring 6 years after the date of the submission of the

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Department of Environmental 
Protection Act''.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) recent concern with Federal environmental policy has 
        highlighted the necessity of assigning to protection of the 
        domestic and international environment a priority which is at 
        least equal to that assigned to other functions of the Federal 
        Government;
            (2) protection of the environment increasingly involves 
        cooperation with foreign states, including the most highly 
        industrialized states all of whose top environmental officials 
        have ministerial status;
            (3) the size of the budget and the number of Federal civil 
        servants devoted to tasks associated with environmental 
        protection at the Environmental Protection Agency is 
        commensurate with departmental status; and
            (4) a cabinet-level Department of Environmental Protection 
        should be established.

SEC. 103. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

        arrangement.
    (2) If the Secretary determines that such conflict of interest 
exists and that such conflict of interest cannot be avoided by 
including appropriate conditions therein, the Secretary may enter into 
such contract, agreement, or arrangement, if the Secretary--

    (d) Public Notice Regarding Conflicts of Interest.--The Secretary 
shall promulgate regulations which require public notice to be given

agreement, or arrangement may result in a conflict of interest which 
cannot be avoided by including appropriate conditions therein.
    (e) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section shall preclude the 
Department from promulgating regulations to monitor potential conflicts 
after the contract award.
    (f) Central File.--The Department shall maintain a central file
