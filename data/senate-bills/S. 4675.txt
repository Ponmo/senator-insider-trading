Read the second time and placed on the calendar
A BILL
To amend the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the “Protect Act”.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds as follows:
(1) In President Obama’s last year in office, Obamacare’s high costs exposed working Americans to potential health insurance coverage loss, the most extreme form of lacking pre-existing conditions protection. That year, there was a 20 percent decrease in enrollment in plans offered on the Exchange among working Americans who earned too much to receive a premium tax credit subsidy, but not enough to cover the over 105 percent increases in premiums under Obamacare.
(2) In 2015, nearly 80 percent of the households who paid the individual mandate tax earned less than $50,000 per year.
(3) Recognizing this unfair burden, in December 2017, Congress acted to restore freedom and liberty to Americans by eliminating the penalty for noncompliance with such individual mandate.
(4) Obamacare is not the only way to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.
(5) Obamacare’s one-size-fits-all approach undermines States’ ability to care for their populations and left many Americans unable to afford any health insurance in the individual market.
(6) Congress will protect individuals with preexisting conditions if the Supreme Court ultimately determines in Texas v. California that Obamacare is unconstitutional.
SEC. 3. GUARANTEED AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE; PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION.
(a) In General.—Subtitle C of title I of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–191) is amended by adding at the end the following:

“(1) PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSION.—
“(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘pre-existing condition exclusion’ means, with respect to coverage, a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to a condition based on the fact that the condition was present before the enrollment date for such coverage, whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received before such date.

“(A) limit the employers that may apply for such coverage to those with eligible individuals who live, work, or reside in the service area for such network plan; and
“(B) within the service area of such plan, deny such coverage to such employers and individuals if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to the applicable State authority that—

“(2) CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed—

“(1) with respect to such an individual or family member of an individual who is a pregnant woman, include genetic information of any fetus carried by such pregnant woman; and
“(2) with respect to an individual or family member utilizing an assisted reproductive technology, include genetic information of any embryo legally held by the individual or family member.
“(f) Programs Of Health Promotion Or Disease Prevention.—
“(1) GENERAL PROVISIONS.—
“(A) GENERAL RULE.—For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B), a program of health promotion or disease prevention (referred to in this subsection as a ‘wellness program’) shall be a program offered by an employer that is designed to promote health or prevent disease that meets the applicable requirements of this subsection.
“(B) NO CONDITIONS BASED ON HEALTH STATUS FACTOR.—If none of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount or rebate or other reward for participation in a wellness program is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor, such wellness program shall not violate this section if participation in the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals and the requirements of paragraph (2) are complied with.
“(C) CONDITIONS BASED ON HEALTH STATUS FACTOR.—If any of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount or rebate or other reward for participation in a wellness program is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor, such wellness program shall not violate this section if the requirements of paragraph (3) are complied with.
“(2) WELLNESS PROGRAMS NOT SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS.—If none of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount or rebate or other reward under a wellness program as described in paragraph (1)(B) are based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor (or if such a wellness program does not provide such a reward), the wellness program shall not violate this section if participation in the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals. The following programs shall not have to comply with the requirements of paragraph (3) if participation in the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals:
“(A) A program that reimburses all or part of the cost for memberships in a fitness center.
“(B) A diagnostic testing program that provides a reward for participation and does not base any part of the reward on outcomes.
“(C) A program that encourages preventive care related to a health condition through the waiver of the copayment or deductible requirement under group health plan for the costs of certain items or services related to a health condition (such as prenatal care or well-baby visits).
“(D) A program that reimburses individuals for the costs of smoking cessation programs without regard to whether the individual quits smoking.
“(E) A program that provides a reward to individuals for attending a periodic health education seminar.
“(3) WELLNESS PROGRAMS SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS.—If any of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount, rebate, or reward under a wellness program as described in paragraph (1)(C) is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor, the wellness program shall not violate this section if the following requirements are complied with:
“(A) The reward for the wellness program, together with the reward for other wellness programs with respect to the plan that requires satisfaction of a standard related to a health status factor, shall not exceed 30 percent of the cost of employee-only coverage under the plan. If, in addition to employees or individuals, any class of dependents (such as spouses or spouses and dependent children) may participate fully in the wellness program, such reward shall not exceed 30 percent of the cost of the coverage in which an employee or individual and any dependents are enrolled. For purposes of this paragraph, the cost of coverage shall be determined based on the total amount of employer and employee contributions for the benefit package under which the employee is (or the employee and any dependents are) receiving coverage. A reward may be in the form of a discount or rebate of a premium or contribution, a waiver of all or part of a cost-sharing mechanism (such as deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance), the absence of a surcharge, or the value of a benefit that would otherwise not be provided under the plan. The Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury may increase the reward available under this subparagraph to up to 50 percent of the cost of coverage if the Secretaries determine that such an increase is appropriate.
“(B) The wellness program shall be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease. A program complies with the preceding sentence if the program has a reasonable chance of improving the health of, or preventing disease in, participating individuals and it is not overly burdensome, is not a subterfuge for discriminating based on a health status factor, and is not highly suspect in the method chosen to promote health or prevent disease.
“(C) The plan shall give individuals eligible for the program the opportunity to qualify for the reward under the program at least once each year.
“(D) The full reward under the wellness program shall be made available to all similarly situated individuals. For such purpose, among other things:
“(i) The reward is not available to all similarly situated individuals for a period unless the wellness program allows—
“(I) for a reasonable alternative standard (or waiver of the otherwise applicable standard) for obtaining the reward for any individual for whom, for that period, it is unreasonably difficult due to a medical condition to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard; and
“(II) for a reasonable alternative standard (or waiver of the otherwise applicable standard) for obtaining the reward for any individual for whom, for that period, it is medically inadvisable to attempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard.
“(ii) If reasonable under the circumstances, the plan or issuer may seek verification, such as a statement from an individual's physician, that a health status factor makes it unreasonably difficult or medically inadvisable for the individual to satisfy or attempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard.
“(E) The plan or issuer involved shall disclose in all plan materials describing the terms of the wellness program the availability of a reasonable alternative standard (or the possibility of waiver of the otherwise applicable standard) required under subparagraph (D). If plan materials disclose that such a program is available, without describing its terms, the disclosure under this subparagraph shall not be required.”.
