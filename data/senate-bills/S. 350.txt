SEC. 302. ADDITIONS TO NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST.

    Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,

adding at the end the following:
    ``(h) NPL Deferral.--

        of a State and subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the President 
        generally shall defer final listing of an eligible response

                to believe is capable of conducting a response action

        not been reached, the President may defer the listing of the 
        eligible response site on the National Priorities List for an 
        additional period of not to exceed 180 days if the President 
        determines deferring the listing would be appropriate based

        elect to discontinue a deferral of, a listing of an eligible 
        response site on the National Priorities List if the President 
        determines that--
                    ``(A) deferral would not be appropriate because the 
                State, as an owner or operator or a significant 
                contributor of hazardous substances to the facility, is 
                a potentially responsible party;
