SEC. 1307. <<NOTE: 22 USC 3351 note.>>  SENSE OF CONGRESS ON 
                          TAIWAN DEFENSE RELATIONS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States' one China policy, as guided by the 
        Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 U.S.C. et seq.), the 
        Three Communiques between the United States and the People's 
        Republic of China, and the Six Assurances provided by the United 
        States to Taiwan in July 1982, is the foundation for United 
        States-Taiwan relations;
            (2) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, the United 
        States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the 
        People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the 
        future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means, and that 
        any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than 
        peaceful means, including boycotts and embargoes, is of grave 
        concern to the United States;
            (3) the increasingly coercive and aggressive behavior of the 
        People's Republic of China toward Taiwan is contrary to the 
        expectation of the peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan;
            (4) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, the capacity 
        to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that 
        would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, 
        of the people on Taiwan should be maintained;
            (5) the United States should continue to support the 
        development of capable, ready, and modern defense forces 
        necessary for Taiwan to maintain sufficient defensive 
        capabilities, including by--
                    (A) supporting acquisition by Taiwan of defense 
                articles and services through foreign military sales, 
                direct commercial sales, and industrial cooperation, 
                with an emphasis on capabilities that support an 
                asymmetric strategy;
                    (B) ensuring timely review of and response to 
                requests of Taiwan for defense articles and services;
                    (C) conducting practical training and military 
                exercises with Taiwan that enable Taiwan to maintain 
                sufficient defensive capabilities, as described in the 
                Taiwan Relations Act;
                    (D) exchanges between defense officials and officers 
                of the United States and Taiwan at the strategic, 
                policy, and functional levels, consistent with the 
                Taiwan Travel Act (Public Law 115-135; 132 Stat. 341), 
                especially for the purposes of--
                          (i) enhancing cooperation on defense planning;
                          (ii) improving the interoperability of the 
                      military forces of the United States and Taiwan; 
                      and
                          (iii) improving the reserve force of Taiwan;
                    (E) cooperating with Taiwan to improve its ability 
                to employ military capabilities in asymmetric ways, as 
                described in the Taiwan Relations Act; and
                    (F) expanding cooperation in humanitarian assistance 
                and disaster relief; and
            (6) the United States should increase its support to a free 
        and open society in the face of aggressive efforts by the

[[Page 137 STAT. 494]]

        Government of the People's Republic of China to curtail or 
        influence the free exercise of rights and democratic franchise.

                exchange for each weapon systems platform.
                    (F) Coordination between the Department and the 
                intelligence community (as such term is defined in 
                section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 
                U.S.C. 3003)) to leverage any efficiencies and overlap 
                with existing datalink waveforms of the intelligence 
                community.
                    (G) Methods to support the rapid integration of 
                common datalinks across the military departments.

                (physical), softcopy (electronic), or digitized data 
                format as may be appropriate.
                    (B) Uniform system.--The Archivist shall ensure that 
                the identification aid program is established in such a 
                manner as to result in the creation of a uniform system 
                for cataloging and finding every unidentified anomalous 
                phenomena record subject to review under this subtitle 
                where ever and how ever stored in hardcopy (physical),

        adjustment, or withholding under the standards of this subtitle; 
        and
            (2) transmit to the Archivist upon approval for postponement

    (g) Periodic Review of Postponed Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena 
Records.--
            (1) In general.--All postponed or redacted records shall be

        Archivist.
            .(2) Requirements.--
                    (A) Public disclosure.--A periodic review under 
                paragraph (1) shall address the public disclosure of 
                additional unidentified anomalous phenomena records in 
                the Collection under the standards of this subtitle.
                    (B) Unclassified written description of reason.--All 
                postponed unidentified anomalous phenomena records 
                determined to require continued postponement shall 
                require an unclassified written description of the 
                reason for such continued postponement relevant to these 
                specific records. <<NOTE: Federal 
                Register, publication. Determination.>>  Such 
                description shall be provided to the Archivist and 
                published in the Federal Register upon determination.
                    (C) Periodic review; downgrading and 
                desclassification of information.--The Archivist shall 
                establish requirements for periodic review of postponed 
                unidentified anomalous phenomena records that shall 
                serve to downgrade and declassify information.
                    (D) <<NOTE: President. Certification.>>  Deadline 
                for full disclosure.--Each unidentified anomalous 
                phenomena record shall be publicly disclosed in full, 
                and available in the Collection, not later than the date 
                that is 25 years after the date of the first creation of 
                the record by the originating body, unless the President 
                certifies that--
                          (i) continued postponement is made necessary 
                      by an identifiable harm to the military defense, 
                      intelligence operations, law enforcement, or 
                      conduct of foreign relations; and
                          (ii) the identifiable harm is of such gravity 
                      that it outweighs the public interest in 
                      disclosure.

    (h) Requirements for Executive Agencies.--
            (1) In general.--The heads of Executive agencies shall--

        costs incurred by the Executive agency in making and providing 
        such copy, except that in no case may the amount of the fee 
        charged exceed the actual expenses incurred by the Executive 
        agency in making and providing such copy.
SEC. 1843. <<NOTE: Deadlines.>>  GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF 
                          PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF UNIDENTIFIED 
                          ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA RECORDS.

    (a) Postponement Determination.--In addition to the relevant 
authorities in Executive Order 13526, disclosure of unidentified 
anomalous phenomena records or particular information in unidentified 
anomalous phenomena records to the public may be postponed subject to 
the limitations of this subtitle if the original classification 
authority makes a determination that there is clear and convincing 
evidence that--
            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence 
        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United States 
        posed by the public disclosure of the unidentified anomalous 
        phenomena record is of such gravity that it outweighs the public 
        interest in disclosure, and such public disclosure would 
        reveal--
                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently 
                requires protection;
                    (B) an intelligence source or method which is 
                currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be 
                utilized, by the Federal Government and which has not 
                been officially disclosed, the disclosure of which would 
                interfere with the conduct of intelligence activities; 
                or
                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the 
                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct of 
                foreign relations of the United States, the disclosure 
                of which would demonstrably and substantially impair the 
                national security of the United States;
            (2) the public disclosure of the unidentified anomalous 
        phenomena record would violate section 552a of title 5, United 
        States Code (referred to as the ``Privacy Act of 1974'');
            (3) the public disclosure of the unidentified anomalous 
        phenomena record could reasonably be expected to constitute an 
        unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of 
        privacy is so substantial that it outweighs the public interest; 
        or
            (4) the public disclosure of the unidentified anomalous 
        phenomena record would compromise the existence of an 
        understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection 
        between a Federal Government agent and a cooperating individual 
        or a foreign government, and public disclosure would be so 
        harmful that it outweighs the public interest.

[[Page 137 STAT. 706]]

    (b) Withdrawal of Records.--Senior Agency Officials designated in 
accordance with Executive Order 13526 or any successor Orders may 
withdraw records in the Collection that are determined to be both not 
related to unidentified anomalous phenomena and properly 
classified. <<NOTE: Notification.>>  The Senior Agency Official must 
notify the congressional leadership and the oversight committees of 
Congress, as identified in section 1841(e), by not later than 60 days 
before each record is withdrawn.

    (c) Congressional Notification of Postponement of Disclosure.--In 
the event that the disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena 
records or particular information in unidentified anomalous phenomena 
records to the public is postponed by an Executive agency, the head of 
the Executive agency shall notify congressional leadership and the 
oversight committees of Congress, as identified in section 1841(e), 
within 15 days of such decision with a reason for the postponement of 
disclosure.

SEC. 5102. <<NOTE: Preventing Child Sex Abuse Act of 2023.>>  
                          PREVENTING CHILD SEX ABUSE.

    (a) <<NOTE: 18 USC 1 note.>>  Short Title.--This section may be 
cited as the ``Preventing Child Sex Abuse Act of 2023''.

    (b) <<NOTE: 18 USC 2423 note.>>  Sense of Congress.--The sense of 
Congress is the following:
            (1) The safety of children should be a top priority for 
        public officials and communities in the United States.
            (2) According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 
        an individual in the United States is sexually assaulted every 
        68 seconds. And every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. 
        Meanwhile, only 25 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will end up 
        in prison.
            (3) The effects of child sexual abuse can be long-lasting 
        and affect the victim's mental health.
            (4) Victims are more likely than non-victims to experience 
        the following mental health challenges:
                    (A) Victims are about 4 times more likely to develop 
                symptoms of drug abuse.
                    (B) Victims are about 4 times more likely to 
                experience post-traumatic stress disorder as adults.
                    (C) Victims are about 3 times more likely to 
                experience a major depressive episode as adults.
            (5) The criminal justice system should and has acted as an 
        important line of defense to protect children and hold 
        perpetrators accountable.
            (6) <<NOTE: Larry Nassar.>>  However, the horrific crimes 
        perpetuated by Larry Nassar demonstrate firsthand the loopholes 
        that still exist in the criminal justice system. While Larry 
        Nassar was found

[[Page 137 STAT. 934]]

        guilty of several State-level offenses, he was not charged 
        federally for his illicit sexual contact with minors, despite 
        crossing State and international borders to commit this conduct.
            (7) The Department of Justice has also identified a growing 
        trend of Americans who use charitable or missionary work in a 
        foreign country as a cover for sexual abuse of children.
            (8) It is the intent of Congress to prohibit Americans from 
        engaging in sexual abuse or exploitation of minors under the 
        guise of work, including volunteer work, with an organization 
        that affects interstate or foreign commerce, such as an 
        international charity.
            (9) Federal law does not require that an abuser's intention 
        to engage in sexual abuse be a primary, significant, dominant, 
        or motivating purpose of the travel.
            (10) Child sexual abuse does not require physical contact 
        between the abuser and the child. This is especially true as 
        perpetrators turn increasingly to internet platforms, online 
        chat rooms, and webcams to commit child sexual abuse.
            (11) However, a decision of the United States Court of 
        Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found the use of a webcam to 
        engage in sexually provocative activity with a minor did not 
        qualify as ``sexual activity''.
            (12) Congress can address this issue by amending the 
        definition of the term ``sexual activity'' to clarify that it 
        does not require interpersonal, physical contact.
            (13) It is the duty of Congress to provide clearer guidance 
        to ensure that those who commit crimes against children are 
        prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

    (c) Interstate Child Sexual Abuse.--Section 2423 of title 18, United 
States Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``with a motivating 
        purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another 
        person'' and inserting ``with intent to engage in any illicit 
        sexual conduct with another person'';

        ``with a motivating purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual 
        conduct'' and inserting ``with intent to engage in any illicit 
        sexual conduct''; and
            (4) by inserting after subsection (g), as so redesignated, 
        the following:

    ``(h) Rule of Construction.--As used in this section, the term 
`intent' shall be construed as any intention to engage in prostitution, 
sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal 
offense, or illicit sexual conduct, as applicable, at the time of the 
transportation or travel.''.
    (d) Abuse Under the Guise of Charity.--Section 2423 of title 18, 
United States Code, as amended by subsection (c) of this section, is 
amended--
            (1) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:

    ``(d) Illicit Sexual Conduct in Connection With Certain 
Organizations. <<NOTE: Penalties.>> --Any citizen of the United States 
or alien admitted for permanent residence who--
            ``(1) is an officer, director, employee, or agent of an

        (d)'' and inserting ``(d), or (e)''; and
            (3) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking 
        ``(f)(2)'' and inserting ``(g)(2)''.

    (e) Sexual Activity With Minors.--Section 2427 of title 18, United 
States Code, is amended by inserting ``does not require interpersonal 
physical contact, and'' before ``includes''.

      TITLE LIII-- <<NOTE: Federal Data Center Enhancement Act of 
2023.>> FEDERAL DATA AND INFORMATION SECURITY

Sec. 5301. Short title.
Sec. 5302. Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative amendments.

SEC. 5301. <<NOTE: 44 USC 101 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Federal Data Center Enhancement Act 
of 2023''.
SEC. 5302. FEDERAL DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION INITIATIVE 
                          AMENDMENTS.

    (a) <<NOTE: 44 USC 3601 note.>> Findings.--Congress finds the 
following:
            (1) The statutory authorization for the Federal Data Center 
        Optimization Initiative under section 834 of the Carl Levin and 
        Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 2015 (44 U.S.C. 3601 note; Public Law 113-291) 
        expired at the end of fiscal year 2022.
            (2) The expiration of the authorization described in 
        paragraph (1) presents Congress with an opportunity to review 
        the objectives of the Federal Data Center Optimization 
        Initiative to ensure that the initiative is meeting the current 
        needs of the Federal Government.
            (3) The initial focus of the Federal Data Center 
        Optimization Initiative, which was to consolidate data centers 
        and create new efficiencies, has resulted in, since 2010--
                    (A) the consolidation of more than 6,000 Federal 
                data centers; and
                    (B) cost savings and avoidance of $5,800,000,000.
            (4) The need of the Federal Government for access to data 
        and data processing systems has evolved since the date of 
        enactment in 2014 of subtitle D of title VIII of the Carl Levin 
        and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2015.
            (5) Federal agencies and employees involved in mission 
        critical functions increasingly need reliable access to secure, 
        reliable, and protected facilities to house mission critical 
        data and data operations to meet the immediate needs of the 
        people of the United States.

[[Page 137 STAT. 941]]

            (6) As of the date of enactment of this title, there is a 
        growing need for Federal agencies to use data centers and cloud 
        applications that meet high standards for cybersecurity, 
        resiliency, and availability.

    (b) Minimum Requirements for New Data Centers.--Section 834 of the 
Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (44 U.S.C. 3601 note; Public Law 113-291) is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking paragraphs (3) and (4) 
        and inserting the following:
            ``(3) <<NOTE: Definition.>> New data center.--The term `new 
        data center' means--
                    ``(A)(i) a data center or a portion thereof that is

        able to recover and, as appropriate, return the proceeds of 
        corruption;

                current and future treaty negotiations and in each 
                international organization of which the United States

                members;
                    (B) to pursue the labeling or treatment of the

                and the People's Republic of China are both current 
                members; and
                    (C) to work with allies and partners of the United

                      WTO members; and
                          (ii) all current plurilateral negotiations at 
                      the WTO in which the People's Republic of China is 
                      actively participating, or it is reasonably 
                      foreseeable that the People's Republic of China

                of the date of the report would provide different 
                treatment or standards for enforcement based on the 
                self-declared development status of WTO members;
                    (D) <<NOTE: List.>>  includes a list of WTO members

                      members;

                                percent of global merchandise trade 
                                annually for each of the most recently

        differential treatment at the world trade organization.--It is 
        the sense of Congress that the United States Trade

        United States, should--
                    (A) oppose the use of special and differential 
                treatment by the People's Republic of China at the WTO;
                    (B) work to preclude the People's Republic of China 
                from being eligible to use special and differential

                          IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--

[[Page 137 STAT. 981]]

            (1) challenges finding and maintaining spousal employment 
        and family dissatisfaction are one of the leading reasons 
        employees cite for leaving the Department;
            (2) tandem Foreign Service personnel represent important 
        members of the Foreign Service community, who act as force 
        multipliers for our diplomacy;
            (3) the Department can and should do more to keep tandem 
        spouses posted together and consider family member employment 
        needs when assigning tandem officers; and
            (4) common sense steps providing more flexibility in the 
        assignments process would improve outcomes for tandem officers

            (1) Family togetherness.--The term ``family togetherness'' 
        means facilitating the placement of Foreign Service personnel at

        members of a tandem couple of Foreign Service personnel.
            (2) Tandem foreign service personnel; tandem.--The terms 
        ``tandem Foreign Service personnel'' and ``tandem'' mean a 
        member of a couple of which one spouse is a career or career 
        candidate employee of the Foreign Service and the other spouse 
        is a career or career candidate employee of the Foreign Service 
        or an employee of one of the agencies authorized to use the 
        Foreign Service Personnel System under section 202 of the 
        Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3922).

        personnel on directed assignments to the same diplomatic post or 
        country as their tandem spouse if they request to be assigned to 
        the same post or country. The Secretary shall also provide a 
        written justification to the requesting personnel explaining any 
        denial of a request that would result in tandem spouses not 
        serving together at the same post or country.
            (2) <<NOTE: Determination.>> Tenured foreign service 
        personnel.--The Secretary shall add family togetherness to the

        tenured tandem Foreign Service personnel at United States 
        diplomatic posts.
            (3) Updates to antinepotism policy.--The Secretary shall 
        update antinepotism policies so that nepotism rules only apply 
        when an employee and a relative are placed into positions 
        wherein they jointly and exclusively control government 
        resources, property, or money or establish government policy.
            (4) Temporary supervision of tandem spouse.--The Secretary 
        shall update policies to allow for a tandem spouse to

        a calendar year, including at a United States diplomatic 
        mission.

          TITLE LXIII--INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBER DIPLOMACY

SEC. 6301. DATA-INFORMED DIPLOMACY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In a rapidly evolving and digitally interconnected 
        global landscape, access to and maintenance of reliable, readily 
        available data is key to informed decisionmaking and diplomacy 
        and therefore should be considered a strategic asset.
            (2) In order to achieve its mission in the 21st century, the 
        Department must adapt to these trends by maintaining

[[Page 137 STAT. 985]]

        and providing timely access to high-quality data at the time and 
        place needed, while simultaneously cultivating a data-savvy 
        workforce.
            (3) Leveraging data science and data analytics has the 
        potential to improve the performance of the Department's 
        workforce by providing otherwise unknown insights into program 
        deficiencies, shortcomings, or other gaps in analysis.
            (4) While innovative technologies such as artificial 
        intelligence and machine learning have the potential to empower 
        the Department to analyze and act upon data at scale, 
        systematized, sustainable data management and information 
        synthesis remain a core competency necessary for data-driven 
        decisionmaking.
            (5) The goals set out by the Department's Enterprise Data 
        Council (EDC) as the areas of most critical need for the 
        Department, including Cultivating a Data Culture, Accelerating 
        Decisions through Analytics, Establishing Mission-Driven Data 
        Management, and Enhancing Enterprise Data Governance, are 
        laudable and will remain critical as the Department develops 
        into a data-driven agency.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department should prioritize the recruitment and 
        retainment of top data science talent in support of its data-
        informed diplomacy efforts as well as its broader modernization 
        agenda; and
            (2) the Department should strengthen data fluency among its 
        workforce, promote data collaboration across and within its 
        bureaus, and enhance its enterprise data oversight.

                          SERVICES CONTRACTORS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department should seek to ensure it has sufficient full-time equivalent 
positions allotted to carry out its current mission,

[[Page 137 STAT. 995]]

working with the Office of Personnel Management and appropriate 
congressional committees to that end, and that the use of personal 
services contractors should not be relied upon to perform core 
Department functions indefinitely.
    (b) Exigent Circumstances and Crisis Response.--To assist the 
Department in addressing and responding to exigent circumstances and 
urgent crises abroad, the Department is authorized to employ, 
domestically and abroad, a limited number of personal services 
contractors in order to meet exigent needs, subject to the requirements 
of this section.
    (c) Authority.--The authority to employ personal services 
contractors is in addition to any existing authorities to enter into 
personal services contracts and authority provided in the Afghanistan 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 (division C of Public Law 117-43).

            (1) enter into contracts to employ a total of up to 100 
        personal services contractors at any given time for each of 
        fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026; and
            (2) allocate up to 20 personal services contractors to a 
        given bureau.

    (e) Limitation.--Employment authorized by this section shall not 
exceed two calendar years.
    (f) Notification and Reporting to Congress.--
            (1) Notification.--Not later than 15 days after the use of 
        authority under this section, the Secretary shall notify the 
        appropriate congressional committees, the Committee on

SEC. 6402. HARD-TO-FILL POSTS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the number of hard-to-fill vacancies at United States 
        diplomatic missions is far too high, particularly in Sub-Saharan 
        Africa;

[[Page 137 STAT. 996]]

            (2) these vacancies--
                    (A) adversely impact the Department's execution of 
                regional strategies;
                    (B) hinder the ability of the United States to 
                effectively compete with strategic competitors, such as 
                the People's Republic of China and the Russian 
                Federation; and
                    (C) present a clear national security risk to the 
                United States; and
            (3) if the Department is unable to incentivize officers to 
        accept hard-to-fill positions, the Department should consider 
        directed assignments, particularly for posts in Africa, and 
        other means to more effectively advance the national interests 
        of the United States.

    (b) Report on Development of Incentives for Hard-to-fill Posts.--Not 
later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this division, 
the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional

to more effectively fill hard-to-fill posts.

                      Foreign Service positions vacant for six months or 
                      longer at overseas posts, including for consular, 
                      political, and economic positions, over the last 
                      five years, broken down by region, and a 
                      comparison of the proportion of vacancies between 
                      regions; and
                          (ii) the feasibility of allowing first-tour 
                      Foreign Service generalists in non-Consular cones, 
                      directed for a consular tour, to volunteer for 
                      reassignment at hard-to-fill posts in understaffed 
                      regions.
                    (B) Matters to be considered.--The study conducted 
                under subparagraph (A) shall consider whether allowing 
                first-tour Foreign Service generalists to volunteer as 
                described in such subparagraph would address current 
                vacancies and what impact the new mechanism would have 
                on consular operations.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 60 days after completing the 
        study required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit 
        to the appropriate congressional committees a report containing 
        the findings of the study.

                          CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

    (a) <<NOTE: 50 USC 3531 note.>>  Sense of Congress.--It is the sense 
of Congress that--
            (1) sexual assault and sexual harassment arise from, and are 
        often indicative of, an environment where toxic, provocative, 
        and sometimes significantly inappropriate behavior is tolerated;
            (2) when supervisors and senior leaders at headquarters and 
        in the field are among the offenders and facilitate a work

[[Page 137 STAT. 1052]]

        climate in which toxic and disrespectful behavior is tolerated, 
        harassment and even assault will often go unaddressed and 
        unpunished;
            (3) while establishing clear policies and procedures and 
        enhancing training are necessary first steps toward protecting 
        victims and establishing stronger internal mechanisms for

        maintain an independent and neutral person with whom all 
        employees at all levels, supervisors and non-supervisors, may 
        speak confidentially, informally, and off-the-record about work-
        related concerns or questions.

        communication made between the victim and any employee of the 
        Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office, if 
        such communication was made for the purpose of facilitating 
        advice or assistance to the victim in accordance with this
