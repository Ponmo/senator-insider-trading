  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
  States of America in Congress assembled,
 [Struck out->] SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   This Act may be cited as the `Veterans' Agent Orange
 Exposure and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of 1989'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 2. INTERIM PERIOD FOR AWARD OF BENEFITS FOR VIETNAM
 VETERANS WITH NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA AND CERTAIN SARCOMAS. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (a) PRESUMPTIVE DISABILITY AND DEATH BENEFITS- (1) In the
 case of a veteran-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (A) who served in the active military, naval, or air
 service in Vietnam during the Vietnam era, and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (B) who has-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (i) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (ii) a soft-tissue sarcoma, [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, except as provided
 in subsection (b), pay a monthly disability benefit to the veteran in
 accordance with this section for any disability resulting from that
 disease. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) If a veteran referred to in paragraph (1) dies from
 a disease referred to in clause (B) of such paragraph, the Secretary shall
 pay a monthly death benefit to the survivors of the veteran in accordance
 with this section. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (b) EXCEPTIONS- Benefits may not be paid in the case of a
 veteran under this section with respect to a disease referred to in subsection
 (a)(1)(B) if-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) there is affirmative evidence that such disease was
 not incurred by that veteran during active military, naval, or air service
 in Vietnam during the Vietnam era; or [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) there is affirmative evidence to establish that,
 between the date of that veteran's most recent departure from Vietnam
 during such service and the onset of such disease, the veteran suffered
 an intercurrent injury or disease recognized as a cause of such disease
 referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (c) DISABILITY BENEFIT- A disability benefit payable to
 a veteran under this section for a disability resulting from a disease
 referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B) shall be paid at the rate at which
 compensation would be payable under chapter 11 of title 38, United States
 Code, to that veteran for such disability if the disability were determined
 to be service-connected. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (d) DEATH BENEFIT- (1) A death benefit is payable under
 this section to the survivors of a deceased veteran who, if the cause of
 the veteran's death had been a service-connected or compensable disability,
 would be entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter
 13 of that title. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) The amount of the death benefit payable to a survivor
 of a deceased veteran under this section shall be the rate that would be
 applicable to such survivor under such chapter 13 if the veteran's death had
 been the result of a service-connected or compensable disability. [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   (e) NONDUPLICATION OF BENEFITS- A benefit may not be
 paid under this section with respect to a disability or death of a veteran
 resulting from a disease referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B) for any month
 for which compensation is payable to that veteran for that disability under
 chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code, or for which dependency and
 indemnity compensation is payable for that death under chapter 13 of such
 title. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (f) TREATMENT OF DISABILITY OR DEATH AS SERVICE-CONNECTED
 EXCEPT FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES- A disability or death from a disease
 referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B) not otherwise considered service-connected
 for purposes of laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs
 shall be treated for purposes of all laws of the United States (other than
 the provisions of chapter 11 (other than sections 357, 358, and 361) of title
 38, United States Code, and chapter 13 of such title) as if such disability
 or death were service-connected. The receipt of a disability benefit under
 this section shall be treated for purposes of all laws of the United States
 as if such benefit were disability compensation under chapter 11 of such
 title. The receipt of a death benefit under this section shall be treated for
 purposes of all laws of the United States as if such benefit were dependency
 and indemnity compensation under chapter 13 of such title. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (g) AWARD OF BENEFITS- Section 3010(g) of title 38,
 United States Code, shall apply to the award of benefits under this
 section. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (h) EXPIRATION OF INTERIM BENEFITS- (1) No benefit may be
 paid or service provided by virtue of this section for any period beginning
 after April 15, 1992. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) If a joint resolution described in paragraph (3)
 (relating to the extension of authority to pay benefits under this section
 or the making of such authority permanent) is introduced in either House
 of Congress after January 1, 1992, Congressional action on such joint
 resolution shall, subject to paragraph (8), be subject to the rules set
 out in this subsection. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term `joint
 resolution' means only a joint resolution-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (A) which does not have a preamble; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (B) the matter after the resolving clause of which is--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (i) as follows: `That section 2(h)(1) of the Veterans'
 Agent Orange Exposure and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of 1989 is
 amended by striking out `April 15, 1992' and inserting in lieu thereof
 `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'.', the blank space being filled with a date; or
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (ii) as follows: `That paragraph (1) of section 2(h) of
 the Veterans' Agent Orange Exposure and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of
 1989 is repealed'; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (C) the title of which is-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (i) as follows: `A joint resolution extending the authority
 to pay certain benefits relating to military service in Vietnam'; or
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (ii) as follows: `A joint resolution making permanent
 the authority to pay certain benefits relating to military service in
 Vietnam'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (4) A resolution described in paragraph (3) introduced in
 the House of Representatives shall be referred to the Committee on Veterans'
 Affairs of the House of Representatives. A resolution described in paragraph
 (3) introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee on Veterans'
 Affairs of the Senate. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (5) If the committee to which a resolution described in
 paragraph (3) is referred has not reported such resolution (or an identical
 resolution) within the 60-day period beginning on the date on which such
 resolution is introduced, such committee shall be discharged from further
 consideration of such resolution as of the day after the last day of such
 period, and such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of
 the House involved. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (6)(A) On or after the third day after the date on which
 the committee to which such a resolution is referred has reported, or
 has been discharged (under paragraph (5)) from further consideration of,
 such a resolution, it is in order (even though a previous motion to the
 same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House
 to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution (but only on the
 day after the calendar day on which Member announces to the House concerned
 the Member's intention to do so). All points of order against the resolution
 (and against consideration of the resolution) are waived. The motion is highly
 privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and
 is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to
 postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A
 motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed
 to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of
 the resolution is agreed to, the respective House shall immediately proceed
 to consideration of the joint resolution without intervening motion, order,
 or other business, and the resolution shall remain the unfinished business
 of the respective House until disposed of. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (B) Debate on the resolution and on all debatable motions
 and appeals in connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10
 hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those
 opposing the resolution. An amendment to the resolution is not in order. A
 motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. A motion to
 postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or
 a motion to recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider
 the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in
 order. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (C) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate
 on a resolution described in paragraph (3) and a single quorum call at
 the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of
 the appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the resolution shall
 occur. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (D) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to
 the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives,
 as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution described in
 paragraph (3) shall be decided without debate. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (7)(A) If, before the passage by one House of a resolution
 of that House described in paragraph (3), that House receives from the
 other House a resolution described in paragraph (3), then the procedures
 specified in this paragraph shall apply. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (B) The resolution of the other House shall not be referred
 to a committee and may not be considered in the House receiving it except in
 the case of final passage as provided in subparagraph (C)(ii). [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (C) With respect to a resolution described in paragraph
 (3) of the House receiving the resolution-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if
 no resolution had been received from the other House; but [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution
 of the other House. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (D) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the
 other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution that
 originated in the receiving House. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (8) This subsection is enacted by Congress-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate
 and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is deemed
 a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with
 respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a
 resolution described in paragraph (3), and it supersedes other rules only
 to the extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of
 either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of
 that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in
 the case of any other rule of that House. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (i) NOTIFICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION-

 surviving spouse, children, and parents of such veteran, if any. [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) The Secretary shall enclose with at least three
 distributions of benefits payment checks to each veteran or other person
 receiving benefits under this section a notice that the authority to pay
 benefits under this section is temporary. Each notice shall contain the date
 of the expiration of such authority. The first notice shall be enclosed with
 the first payment of such benefits to a veteran. The last notice shall be
 enclosed with the last payment of such benefits. At least one notice shall
 be enclosed with a payment distributed in approximately the middle of the
 estimated period during which the authority is to be in effect. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (j) DEFINITIONS- For the purposes of this section--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) the term `veteran' has the meaning given such term in
 sections 101(2) and 401 of title 38, United States Code; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) the terms `child' and `parents' have the meanings
 given such terms in paragraphs (4) and (5), respectively, of section 101
 of such title. [<-Struck out]

 [Struck out->] SEC. 3. PRESUMPTION OF SERVICE CONNECTION FOR
 CHLORACNE. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   Section 312 of title 38, United States Code, is amended
 by adding at the end the following new subsection: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(d) For the purposes of section 310 of this title, and
 subject to the provisions of section 313 of this title, in the case of a
 veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in Vietnam
 during the Vietnam era, the disease of chloracne shall be considered to have
 been incurred in or aggravated by such service in Vietnam, notwithstanding
 there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of such
 service in Vietnam, if such disease or another acneform disease consistent
 with chloracne became manifest to a 10 percent degree of disability or more
 within one year after the last date on which that veteran performed such
 service in Vietnam.'. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 4. PRESUMPTION OF SERVICE CONNECTION FOR DISEASES
 ASSOCIATED WITH EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN HERBICIDE AGENTS. [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) It is in the public interest to provide for an
 independent nonprofit scientific organization which has appropriate
 expertise and is not connected to the Department of Veterans Affairs to
 review and evaluate the available scientific evidence regarding associations
 between diseases and exposure to dioxin and other chemical compounds in
 herbicides and to make judgments on the degree and probability of such
 associations, because there is no uniform body of scientific literature on
 such issues. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) The standard of proof required for a scientific
 conclusion of causation is higher than the standard of proof required
 for justification of a presumption, for purposes of veterans disability
 compensation laws, that an adverse health effect is connected, based on sound
 medical and scientific evidence, to active service in the Armed Forces of
 the United States. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (b) IN GENERAL- (1) Subchapter II of chapter 11 of title 38,
 United States Code, is amended by inserting after section 312 the following
 new section: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] ` 312A. Presumption of service connection for diseases
 associated with effects of exposure to certain herbicide agents [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(a) IN GENERAL- (1) For the purposes of section 310 of
 this title, and subject to section 313 of this title, in the case of a
 Vietnam veteran who, during Vietnam service, was exposed to an herbicide
 agent containing dioxin or 2,4dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or to any other
 herbicide agent, each disease (if any) listed in regulations prescribed
 by the Secretary in accordance with this section and identified in such
 regulations as having positive association with the biological effects of
 exposure to such herbicide agent shall be considered to have been incurred
 in or aggravated by such service, notwithstanding that there is no record
 of evidence of such disease during the period of such service. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) For the purposes of this subsection, a veteran
 who performed Vietnam service and has a disease referred to in paragraph
 (1) of this subsection shall be presumed to have been exposed during such
 service to an herbicide agent containing dioxin or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
 acid, and may be presumed to have been exposed during such service to any
 other chemical compound in an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative
 evidence to establish conclusively that the veteran was not exposed to any
 such agent during such service. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) The Secretary may extend the applicability of paragraph
 (1) of this subsection to the case of any veteran who, during the performance
 of active military, naval, or air service outside Vietnam, was exposed to
 an agent of the same type as the herbicide agent referred to in paragraph
 (1) of this subsection. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(b) DISEASES TO BE PRESCRIBED IN REGULATIONS- (1) Whenever
 the Secretary determines pursuant to this section that there is positive
 association between any disease and the biological effects of exposure to
 an herbicide agent in Vietnam, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations
 listing each disease having such positive association. In the case of
 each disease listed in the regulations, the Secretary shall identify the
 herbicide agent that causes the biological effects with which the disease has
 positive association. After the Secretary prescribes regulations pursuant to
 this paragraph, the Secretary shall periodically revise such regulations,
 as appropriate, to reflect determinations periodically made pursuant to
 paragraph (2) of this subsection. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) The Secretary shall periodically (not less often than
 biennially)-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) determine whether any disease not listed in
 regulations under this section has positive association with such effects;
 and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) determine whether any disease listed in such regulations
 does not have positive association with such effects. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) The Secretary shall make determinations for the purpose
 of this subsection on the basis of reports received by the Secretary from
 a contract scientific organization pursuant to this section and all other
 relevant scientific evidence, information, or analyses available to the
 Secretary at the time of the determinations. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(c) UTILIZATION OF CONTRACT SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION- In
 prescribing and revising regulations for the purposes of subsection (b),
 the Secretary shall obtain, by contract, the determinations and estimates of
 a contract scientific organization as provided in this section. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(d) REQUIRED ACTIVITIES OF CONTRACT SCIENTIFIC
 ORGANIZATIONS- (1) Each contract entered into under subsection (c) of this
 section shall provide for a contract scientific organization-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) to determine, in the case of each herbicide agent--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) which diseases (if any) have positive association with
 the biological effects of exposure to such agent, including specifically
 effects involving porphyrin synthesis, nervous system function, immune
 function, reproduction, and birth defects, and psychological and psychiatric
 effects; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) which diseases (if any) have limited positive
 association with such biological effects; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iii) which diseases (if any) have insubstantial association
 with such biological effects; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iv) to the extent practicable, the biological basis for
 the positive, limited positive, and insubstantial associations of diseases
 referred to in subclauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause with such
 biological effects; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) to estimate the extent of the association between each
 such disease and such biological effects using methods as quantitative and
 as objective as the relevant available data permit. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) The contract scientific organization shall specifically
 determine whether there is positive, limited positive, or insubstantial
 association between the biological effects referred to in paragraph (1)
 of this subsection and the following diseases: [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) Each soft-tissue sarcoma. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) Lung cancer. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(D) Each other cancer. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(e) REQUIRED PROVISIONS FOR FIRST CONTRACT- (1) The first
 contract entered into under subsection (c) of this section shall provide
 for the contract scientific organization-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) to conduct as comprehensive a survey and evaluation
 as is practicable of the completed and ongoing scientific studies of,
 and other scientific evidence or information regarding, the effects that
 herbicide agents have on humans or other animals that have been exposed
 to such agents, including an evaluation of the CDC Selected Cancers Study
 report; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) make its determinations and estimates on the basis
 of the results of such survey and evaluation. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) The contract scientific organization shall conduct the
 survey and evaluation referred to in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection
 through a panel composed of recognized experts in toxicology, medicine,
 epidemiology, statistics, biochemistry, and related fields. The conduct of
 such survey shall be subject to appropriate peer review. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(f) REQUIRED CONTRACT PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERIODIC
 DETERMINATIONS OF THE SECRETARY- A contract entered into under subsection (c)
 of this section in connection with the Secretary's periodic determinations
 under subsection (b)(2) of this section shall require a contract scientific
 organization-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(1) to conduct as comprehensive a survey and evaluation as
 is practicable of the scientific studies, evidence, and information referred
 to in subsection (e)(1)(A) of this section that have become available since
 the last such survey and evaluation under this section; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) make its determinations and estimates on the basis
 of the results of such survey and evaluation and all other surveys and
 evaluations conducted for the purposes of this section. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(g) REPORTS OF CONTRACT SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONS- (1)
 Each contract scientific organization making determinations and estimates
 under this section shall transmit to the Secretary and the Committees on
 Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives a written
 report regarding its determinations and estimates. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(2) Each report shall contain-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) the name of each disease (if any) determined to have
 positive association with the biological effects of exposure to an herbicide
 agent in Vietnam and the identity of such agent; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) the name of each disease (if any) determined to have
 limited positive association with the biological effects of exposure to an
 herbicide agent in Vietnam and the identity of such agent; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) the name of each disease (if any) determined to have
 insubstantial association with the biological effects of exposure to an
 herbicide agent in Vietnam and the identity of such agent; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(D) with respect to each disease named pursuant to clauses
 (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) a discussion of the biological basis for the
 association; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) the contract scientific organization's estimate of
 the statistical significance of the association; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iii) the contract scientific organization's estimate of
 the relative risk for such disease in veterans who, during Vietnam service,
 were exposed to an herbicide agent; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iv) the probability that the estimates referred to in
 subclauses (ii) and (iii) are correct. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(3) Estimates and probabilities are not required under
 clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection when the
 available data do not permit meaningful estimates and probabilities. [<-Struck
 out]
 [Struck out->]   `(4)(A) If a contract scientific organization determines that
 a disease has positive association with the biological effects of exposure
 to an herbicide agent used in Vietnam, such organization shall determine
 whether there is a reasonable basis for concluding that a Vietnam veteran
 with the highest level of exposure to that herbicide agent in Vietnam was
 exposed to such agent under the circumstances necessary for such biological
 effects. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(B) If a contract scientific organization determines
 that there is no such reasonable basis, the organization shall state that
 determination in a report under this subsection and include in such report--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) a description of the evidence that supports such
 determination; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(ii) a description of the evidence (if any) that supports
 alternative conclusions; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(iii) a full discussion of the organization's reasons
 for such determination, including a discussion of the reasons for the
 organization's determination that the evidence referred to in clause (i)
 of this subparagraph outweighs the evidence (if any) referred to in clause
 (ii) of this subparagraph. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(C) A determination with respect to reasonable basis is
 not required under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph when the available
 data do not permit a meaningful determination. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(5) The first report under this subsection shall be
 transmitted to the Secretary and the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the
 Senate and the House of Representatives on or before the later of (A) the
 date 60 days after the date on which the contract scientific organization
 obtains a copy of the CDC Selected Cancers Study report, or (B) the date
 one year after the date of the enactment of the Veterans' Agent Orange
 Exposure and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of 1989. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(h) ACTIONS OF THE SECRETARY AFTER RECEIVING THE FIRST
 REPORT- (1) Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary
 receives the first report under subsection (g) of this section, the Secretary
 shall-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(A) for the purpose of subsection (b)(1) of this section--
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   `(i) determine in accordance with subsection (b)(3) of

  (6)(A) On or after the third day after the date on which the committee to
  which such a resolution is referred has reported, or has been discharged
  (under paragraph (5)) from further consideration of, such a resolution,
  it is in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has
  been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to move to
  proceed to the consideration of the resolution (but only on the day after
  the calendar day on which Member announces to the House concerned the
  Member's intention to do so). All points of order against the resolution
  (and against consideration of the resolution) are waived. The motion is
  highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in
  the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment,
  or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration
  of other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is
  agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed
  to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, then, subject to
  the following sentence, the respective House shall immediately proceed to
  consideration of the joint resolution without intervening motion, order,
  or other business, and the resolution shall remain the unfinished business
  of the respective House until disposed of. If such resolution has been
  reported by the committee with an amendment, the resolution shall (without
  further motion) first be recommitted to the committee with instructions
  to report forthwith the resolution as introduced without amendment.
  (B) Debate on the resolution and on all debatable motions and appeals in
  connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which
  shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the
  resolution. An amendment to the resolution is not in order. A motion further
  to limit debate is in order and not debatable. A motion to postpone, or a
  motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion to
  recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote
  by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.
  (C) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a resolution
  described in paragraph (3) and a single quorum call at the conclusion of
  the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate
  House, the vote on final passage of the resolution shall occur.
  (D) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application
  of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case
  may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution described in paragraph
  (3) shall be decided without debate.
  (7)(A) If, before the passage by one House of a resolution of that House
  described in paragraph (3), that House receives from the other House a
  resolution described in paragraph (3) with an identical text, then the
  procedures specified in this paragraph shall apply.
  (B) The resolution of the other House shall not be referred to a committee
  and may not be considered in the House receiving it except in the case of
  final passage as provided in subparagraph (C)(ii).
  (C) With respect to a resolution described in paragraph (3) of the House
  receiving the resolution--
  (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no resolution had
  been received from the other House; but
  (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of the other House.
  (D) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the other House, it
  shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution that originated in
  the receiving House.
  (8) This subsection is enacted by Congress--
  (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House
  of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is deemed a part of the
  rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to
  the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a resolution
  described in paragraph (3), and it supersedes other rules only to the
  extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
  (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House
  to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House)
  at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of
  any other rule of that House.
  (i) NOTIFICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION- (1) The Secretary of
  Veterans Affairs shall take all reasonable actions--
  (A) to publicize the provisions of this section, not later than 30 days
  after the date of the enactment of this Act; and
  (B) to provide actual notice of the provisions of this section, not later
  than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act--
  (i) to each person described in subsection (a) who, before October 1,
  1989, has filed any claim for benefits under programs administered by the
  Department of Veterans Affairs on the basis of a disease referred to in
  subsection (a)(1)(B); and
  (ii) in the case of a veteran who dies after filing such a claim but before
  the provisions of this section are publicized, to the surviving spouse,
  children, and parents of such veteran, if any.
  (2) The Secretary shall enclose with at least three distributions of
  benefits payment checks to each veteran or other person receiving benefits
  under this section a notice that the authority to pay benefits under this
  section is temporary. Each notice shall contain the date of the expiration
  of such authority as provided in subsection (h). The first notice shall
  be enclosed with the first payment of such benefits to a veteran. The last
  notice shall be enclosed with the last payment of such benefits. At least
  one notice shall be enclosed with a payment distributed in approximately
  the middle of the estimated period during which the authority is to be in
  effect as provided for in subsections (g), (h), and (k).
  (j) DEFINITIONS- For the purposes of this section--
  (1) the term `veteran' has the meaning given such term in sections 101(2)
  and 401 of title 38, United States Code; and
  (2) the terms `child', `parents', and `Vietnam era' have the meanings given
  such terms in paragraphs (4), (5), and (29), respectively, of section 101
  of such title.
  (k) EFFECTIVE DATE- This section, other than subsection (i), shall take
  effect on October 1, 1989. Benefits shall be paid in accordance with this
  section for periods beginning on or after such date, but no benefit may

  this section.
SEC. 3. PRESUMPTION OF SERVICE CONNECTION FOR CHLORACNE.
  Section 312 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the
  end the following new subsection:
  `(d) For the purposes of section 310 of this title, and subject to the
  provisions of section 313 of this title, in the case of a veteran who,
  during active military, naval, or air service, served in Vietnam during
  the Vietnam era, the disease of chloracne shall be considered to have been
  incurred in or aggravated by such service in Vietnam, notwithstanding there
  is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of such service
  in Vietnam, if such disease or another acneform disease consistent with
  chloracne became manifest to a 10 percent degree of disability or more
  within one year after the last date on which that veteran performed such
  service in Vietnam.'.
SEC. 4. PRESUMPTION OF SERVICE CONNECTION FOR DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH
EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN HERBICIDE AGENTS.
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) It is in the public interest to provide for an independent nonprofit
  scientific organization which has appropriate expertise and is not connected
  to the Department of Veterans Affairs to review and evaluate the available
  scientific evidence regarding associations between diseases and exposure
  in Vietnam during the Vietnam era to dioxin and other chemical compounds
  in herbicides and to make judgments on the degree and probability of such
  associations, because there is no uniform body of scientific literature
  on such issues.
  (2) The standard of proof required for a scientific conclusion of causation
  is higher than the standard of proof required for justification of a
  presumption, for purposes of veterans' disability compensation laws, that
  an adverse health effect is connected, based on sound medical and scientific
  evidence, to active service in the Armed Forces of the United States.
  (b) IN GENERAL- (1) Subchapter II of chapter 11 of title 38, United States
  Code, is amended by inserting after section 312 the following new section:
` 312A. Presumption of service connection for diseases associated with
effects of exposure to certain herbicide agents
  `(a)(1) For the purposes of section 310 of this title, and subject to
  section 313 of this title, in the case of a Vietnam veteran who, during
  Vietnam service, was exposed to an herbicide agent containing dioxin or
  2,4dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or to any other herbicide agent, each disease
  (if any) listed in regulations prescribed by the Secretary in accordance
  with this section and identified in such regulations as having positive
  association with the biological effects of exposure to such herbicide agent
  shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated by such service,
  notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during
  the period of such service.
  `(2) For the purposes of this subsection, a veteran who performed Vietnam
  service and has a disease referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection
  shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide
  agent containing dioxin or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and may be
  presumed to have been exposed during such service to any other chemical
  compound in an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to
  establish conclusively that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent
  during such service.
  `(3) The Secretary may extend the applicability of paragraph (1) of this
  subsection to the case of any veteran who, during the performance of
  active military, naval, or air service outside Vietnam, was exposed to
  an agent of the same type as the herbicide agent referred to in paragraph
  (1) of this subsection.
  `(b)(1) Whenever the Secretary determines pursuant to this section that there
  is positive association between any disease and the biological effects of
  exposure to an herbicide agent in Vietnam, the Secretary shall prescribe
  regulations listing each disease having such positive association. In the
  case of each disease listed in the regulations, the Secretary shall identify
  the herbicide agent that causes the biological effects with which the
  disease has positive association. After the Secretary prescribes regulations
  pursuant to this paragraph, the Secretary shall periodically revise such
  regulations, as appropriate, to reflect determinations periodically made
  pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.
  `(2) The Secretary shall periodically (not less often than biennially)--
  `(A) determine whether any disease not listed in regulations under this
  section has positive association with such effects; and
  `(B) determine whether any disease listed in such regulations does not
  have positive association with such effects.
  `(3) The Secretary shall make determinations for the purposes of this
  subsection on the basis of reports received by the Secretary from a contract
  scientific organization pursuant to this section and all other relevant
  scientific evidence, information, or analyses available to the Secretary
  at the time of the determinations.
  `(c) In prescribing and revising regulations for the purposes of subsection
  (b), the Secretary shall obtain, by contract, the determinations and
  estimates of a contract scientific organization as provided in this section.
  `(d)(1) Each contract entered into under subsection (c) of this section
  shall provide for a contract scientific organization--
  `(A) to determine, in the case of each herbicide agent--
  `(i) which diseases (if any) have positive association with the biological
  effects of exposure to such agent, including specifically effects involving
  porphyrin synthesis, nervous system function, immune function, reproduction,
  and birth defects, and psychological and psychiatric effects;
  `(ii) which diseases (if any) have limited positive association with such
  biological effects;
  `(iii) which diseases (if any) have insubstantial association with such
  biological effects; and
  `(iv) to the extent practicable, the biological basis for the positive,
  limited positive, and insubstantial associations of diseases referred to
  in subclauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause with such biological
  effects; and
  `(B) to estimate the extent of the association between each such disease
  and such biological effects using methods as quantitative and as objective
  as the relevant available data permit.
  `(2) The contract scientific organization shall specifically determine
  whether there is positive, limited positive, or insubstantial association
  between the biological effects referred to in paragraph (1) of this
  subsection and the following diseases:
  `(A) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
  `(B) Each soft-tissue sarcoma.
  `(C) Lung cancer.
  `(D) Each other cancer.
  `(e)(1) The first contract entered into under subsection (c) of this
  section shall provide for the contract scientific organization--
  `(A) to conduct as comprehensive a survey and evaluation as is practicable
  of the completed and ongoing scientific studies of, and other scientific
  evidence or information regarding, the effects that herbicide agents
  have on humans or other animals that have been exposed to such agents,
  including an evaluation of the CDC Selected Cancers Study report; and
  `(B) make its determinations and estimates on the basis of the results of
  such survey and evaluation.
  `(2) The contract scientific organization shall conduct the survey and
  evaluation referred to in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection through a
  panel composed of recognized experts in toxicology, medicine, epidemiology,
  statistics, biochemistry, and related fields. The conduct of such survey
  shall be subject to appropriate peer review.
  `(f) A contract entered into under subsection (c) of this section in
  connection with the Secretary's periodic determinations under subsection
  (b)(2) of this section shall require a contract scientific organization--
  `(1) to conduct as comprehensive a survey and evaluation as is practicable of
  the scientific studies, evidence, and information referred to in subsection
  (e)(1)(A) of this section that have become available since the last such
  survey and evaluation under this section; and
  `(2) make its determinations and estimates on the basis of the results of
  such survey and evaluation and all other surveys and evaluations conducted
  for the purposes of this section.
  `(g)(1) Each contract scientific organization making determinations
  and estimates under this section shall transmit to the Secretary and
  the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House of
  Representatives a written report regarding its determinations and estimates.
  `(2) Each report shall contain--
  `(A) the name of each disease (if any) determined to have positive
  association with the biological effects of exposure to an herbicide agent
  in Vietnam and the identity of such agent;
  `(B) the name of each disease (if any) determined to have limited positive
  association with the biological effects of exposure to an herbicide agent
  in Vietnam and the identity of such agent;
  `(C) the name of each disease (if any) determined to have insubstantial
  association with the biological effects of exposure to an herbicide agent
  in Vietnam and the identity of such agent; and
  `(D) with respect to each disease named pursuant to clauses (A), (B), and
  (C) of this paragraph--
  `(i) a discussion of the biological basis for the association;
  `(ii) the contract scientific organization's estimate of the statistical
  significance of the association;
  `(iii) the contract scientific organization's estimate of the relative risk
  for such disease in veterans who, during Vietnam service, were exposed to
  an herbicide agent; and
  `(iv) the probability that the estimates referred to in subclauses (ii)
  and (iii) are correct.
  `(3) Estimates and probabilities are not required under clauses (ii),
  (iii), and (iv) of paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection when the available
  data do not permit meaningful estimates and probabilities.
  `(4)(A) If a contract scientific organization determines that a disease
  has positive association with the biological effects of exposure to an
  herbicide agent used in Vietnam, such organization shall determine whether
  there is a reasonable basis for concluding that a Vietnam veteran with the
  highest level of exposure to that herbicide agent in Vietnam was exposed
  to such agent under the circumstances necessary for such biological effects.
  `(B) If a contract scientific organization determines that there is no
  such reasonable basis, the organization shall state that determination in
  a report under this subsection and include in such report--
  `(i) a description of the evidence that supports such determination;
  `(ii) a description of the evidence (if any) that supports alternative
  conclusions; and
  `(iii) a full discussion of the organization's reasons for such
  determination, including a discussion of the reasons for the organization's
  determination that the evidence referred to in clause (i) of this
  subparagraph outweighs the evidence (if any) referred to in clause (ii)
  of this subparagraph.
  `(C) A determination with respect to reasonable basis is not required
  under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph when the available data do not
  permit a meaningful determination.
  `(5) The first report under this subsection shall be transmitted to the
  Secretary and the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the
  House of Representatives on or before the later of (A) the date 60 days
  after the date on which the contract scientific organization obtains a
  copy of the CDC Selected Cancers Study report, or (B) the date one year
  after the date of the enactment of the Veterans' Agent Orange Exposure
  and Vietnam Service Benefits Act of 1989.
  `(h)(1) Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary receives
  the first report under subsection (g) of this section, the Secretary shall--
  `(A) for the purpose of subsection (b)(1) of this section--
  `(i) determine in accordance with subsection (b)(3) of this section whether
  there is positive association between any disease and the biological
  effects of exposure to an herbicide agent in Vietnam; and
  `(ii) if so, issue proposed regulations listing each such disease and
  specifying such agent;
  `(B) transmit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and
  the House of Representatives a report containing the scientific basis for
  including each disease listed in such proposed regulations, and
  `(C) if any disease listed in the first report under subsection (g)
  of this subsection as having positive association is not listed in such
  proposed regulations--
  `(i) include in the report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs a
  discussion of the scientific basis for not including that disease in the
  proposed regulations; and
  `(ii) publish in the Federal Register a notice that such disease is not
  listed in the proposed regulations despite the report under subsection
  (g) and include in such notice a discussion of such scientific basis.
  `(2) Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary issues
  any proposed regulations pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection,
  the Secretary shall issue final regulations under subsection (b). Such
  regulations shall be effective on the date of issuance.
  `(i)(1) Upon receiving a contract scientific organization's report after
  a periodic survey and evaluation conducted for the purpose of subsection
  (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall--
  `(A) determine in accordance with subsection (b)(3) of this section whether--
  `(i) any disease named in such report not listed in regulations under
  subsection (b) of this section has positive association with the biological
  effects of exposure to an herbicide agent in Vietnam; and
  `(ii) any disease listed in such regulations does not have positive
  association with such effects; and
  `(B) promptly transmit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the
  Senate and the House of Representatives a report containing the Secretary's
  determinations under clause (A) of this paragraph and the scientific bases
  for such determinations.
  `(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after transmitting a report to the
  Committees on Veterans' Affairs under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection,
  the Secretary shall prescribe or revise regulations, as the case may be,
  pursuant to subsection (b) of this section as may be necessary to reflect
  the Secretary's determinations included in that report. The regulations or
  revisions of regulations, as the case may be, shall take effect 30 days
  after the date on which the Secretary issues the proposed regulations or
  revisions, as the case may be.
  `(B) If any disease listed in a periodic report under subsection (g) of this
  section as having positive association is not listed in such regulations
  or revisions of regulations, as the case may be, the Secretary shall, not
  later than 60 days after transmitting a report under subparagraph (A) of
  this paragraph, publish in the Federal Register a notice that such disease
  is not listed in the proposed regulations despite such report and include
  in such notice a discussion of the scientific basis for not including that
  disease in such regulations or revisions.
  `(j) Whenever a disease is removed from regulations pursuant to paragraph
  (2) of subsection (i) of this section as a result of a determination under
  paragraph (1)(A)(ii) of such subsection--
  `(1) any veteran who was awarded compensation for such disease on the basis
  of the presumption provided in subsection (a) of this section before the
  effective date of the removal shall continue to be entitled to receive
  compensation on such basis; and
  `(2) any survivor of a veteran who was awarded dependency and indemnity
  compensation for the death of a veteran resulting from such disease on
  the basis of such presumption shall continue to be entitled to receive
  dependency and indemnity compensation on such basis.
  `(k) The contract authority provided in this section shall be effective
  for a fiscal year to such extent or in such amount as is provided for in
  an appropriation Act.
