                               RESOLUTION


 
         Relating to the censure of William Jefferson Clinton.

Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, engaged in an 
        inappropriate relationship with a subordinate employee in the White 
        House, which was shameful, reckless and indefensible;
Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, deliberately 
        misled and deceived the American people, and people in all branches of 
        the United States Government;
Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, gave false or 
        misleading testimony and his actions have had the effect of impeding 
        discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings;
Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter is unacceptable for a 
        President of the United States, does demean the Office of the President 
        as well as the President himself, and creates disrespect for the laws of 
        the land;
Whereas William Jefferson Clinton fully deserves censure for engaging in such 
        behavior;
Whereas future generations of Americans must know that such behavior is not only 
        unacceptable but also bears grave consequences, including loss of 
        integrity, trust and respect;
Whereas William Jefferson Clinton remains subject to criminal actions in a court 
        of law like any other citizen;
Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter has brought shame and 
        dishonor to himself and to the Office of the President; and
Whereas William Jefferson Clinton through his conduct in this matter has 
        violated the trust of the American people: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the United States Senate does hereby censure William 
        Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, and does 
        condemn his wrongful conduct in the strongest terms;
            (2) the United States Senate recognizes the historic 
        gravity of this bipartisan resolution, and trusts and urges 
        that future congresses will recognize the importance of 
        allowing this bipartisan statement of censure and condemnation 
        to remain intact for all time; and
            (3) the Senate now move on to other matters of significance 
        to our people, to reconcile differences between and within the 
        branches of government, and to work together--across party 
        lines--for the benefit of the American people.
                                 <all>
