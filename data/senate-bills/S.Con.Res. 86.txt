    (c) Sense of the Senate on VA Compensation and Post-Service 
Smoking-Related Illnesses.--
            (1) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
                    (A) the President has twice included in his budgets 
                a prohibition on the entitlement expansion that the 
                Department of Veterans Affairs (referred to as the 
                ``VA'') is proposing to allow post-service smoking-
                related illness to be eligible for VA compensation;
                    (B) Congress has never acted on this entitlement 
                expansion;
                    (C) the Congressional Budget Office and the Office 
                of Management and Budget have concluded that this 
                change in VA policy would result in at least 
                $10,000,000,000 over 5 years and $45,000,000,000 over 
                10 years in additional mandatory costs to the VA;
                    (D) these increased number of claims and the 
                resulting costs may present undue delay and hardship on 
                veterans seeking claim review;
                    (E) the entitlement expansion apparently runs 
                counter to all existing VA policy, including a 
                statement by former Secretary Brown that ``It is 
                inappropriate to compensate for death or disability 
                resulting from veterans' personal choice to engage in 
                conduct damaging to their health.''; and
                    (F) Secretary Brown's comment was recently 
                reaffirmend by Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
                Togo West, who stated ``It has been the position of the 
                Department and of my predecessor that the decision to 
                use tobacco by service members is a personal decision 
                and is not a requirement for military service. And that 
                therefore to compensate veterans for diseases whose 
                sole connection to service is a veteran's own tobacco 
                use should not rest with the Government.''.
            (2) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate 
        that the function totals and assumptions underlying this 
        resolution assume the following:
                    (A) The support of the President's proposal to not 
                allow post-service smoking related illnesses to be 
                eligible for VA.
                    (B) The study and report required by subparagraph 
                (C) will be completed.
                    (C) The Secretary of the Department of Veterans 
                Affairs, the Office of Management and Budget, and the 
                General Accounting Office are jointly required to--
                            (i) jointly study (referred to in this 
                        section as the ``study'') the VA General 
                        Counsel's determination and the resulting 
                        actions to change the compensation rules to 
                        include disability and death benefits for 
                        conditions related to the use of tobacco 
                        products during service; and
                            (ii) deliver an opinion as to whether 
                        illnesses resulting from post-service smoking 
                        should be considered as a compensable 
                        disability.
                    (D) The study should include--
                            (i) the estimated numbers of those filing 
                        such claims, the cost resulting from such 
                        benefits, the time necessary to review such 
                        claims, and how such a number of claims will 
                        affect the VA's ability to review its current 
                        claim load;
                            (ii) an examination of how the proposed 
                        change corresponds to prior VA policy relating 
                        to post-service actions taken by an individual; 
                        and
                            (iii) what Federal benefits, both VA and 
                        non-VA, former service members having smoking-
                        related illnesses are eligible to receive.
                    (E) The study shall be completed no later than July 
                1, 1999.
                    (F) The Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
                Office of Management and Budget shall report their 
                finding to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the 
                Senate and the chairmen and ranking minority members of 
                the Senate Budget and Veterans' Affairs Committees.

    If the Supreme Court rules that the Line Item Veto Act is 
unconstitutional, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget may make 
appropriate adjustments to the allocations and aggregates in this 
resolution to reflect the effects of the President's cancellations 
becoming null and void.

    (a) Discretionary Limits.--In the Senate, in this section and for 
the purposes of allocations made for the discretionary category

term ``discretionary spending limit'' means--
            (1) with respect to fiscal year 1999--

                new budget authority and $266,635,000,000 in outlays;
                    (B) for the nondefense category: $255,450,000,000

                    (B) for the violent crime reduction category: 
                $4,400,000,000 in new budget authority and 
                $5,981,000,000 in outlays; and
            (4) with respect to fiscal year 2002--
                    (A) for the discretionary category: 
                $546,574,000,000 in new budget authority and 
                $556,269,000,000 in outlays; and
                    (B) for the violent crime reduction category: 
                $4,500,000,000 in new budget authority and 
                $4,530,000,000 in outlays;
as adjusted in strict conformance with subsection (b) of section 251 of 
the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and 
section 314 of the Congressional Budget Act.
    (b) Point of Order in the Senate.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it 
        shall not be in order in the Senate to consider--
                    (A) a revision of this resolution or any concurrent 
                resolution on the budget for fiscal years 1999, 2000, 
                2001, or 2002 (or amendment, motion, or conference 
                report on such a resolution) that provides 
                discretionary spending in excess of the discretionary 
                spending limit or limits for such fiscal year; or
                    (B) any bill or resolution (or amendment, motion, 
                or conference report on such bill or resolution) for 
                fiscal year 1999, 2000, 2001, or 2002 that would cause 
                any of the limits in this section (or suballocations of 
                the discretionary limits made pursuant to section 
                302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974) to be 
                exceeded.
            (2) Exception.--This section shall not apply if a 
        declaration of war by the Congress is in effect or if a joint 
        resolution pursuant to section 258 of the Balanced Budget and 
        Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 has been enacted.
    (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the Senate 
only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly 
chosen and sworn.
    (d) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of the Chair 
relating to any provision of this section shall be limited to 1 hour, 
to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the appellant and the 
manager of the concurrent resolution, bill, or joint resolution, as the 
case may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the 
Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to 
sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised 
under this section.
    (e) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this section, 
the levels of new budget authority, outlays, new entitlement authority, 
revenues, and deficits for a fiscal year shall be determined on the 
basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate.

SEC. 207. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.

    Congress adopts the provisions of this title--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such 
        they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, or 
        of that House to which they specifically apply, and such rules 
        shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are 
        inconsistent therewith; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to 
        that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same 
        extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.

              TITLE III--SENSE OF CONGRESS AND THE SENATE

SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PASSAGE OF THE SENATE FINANCE 
              COMMITTEE'S IRS RESTRUCTURING BILL.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2676 on 
        November 5, 1997;
            (2) the Finance Committee of the Senate has held several 
        days of hearings this year on Internal Revenue Service 
        restructuring proposals;
            (3) the hearings demonstrated many areas in which the 
        House-passed bill could be improved;
            (4) on March 31, 1998, the Senate Finance Committee voted 
        20-0 to report an Internal Revenue Service restructuring 
        package that contains more oversight over the Internal Revenue 
        Service, more accountability for employees, and a new arsenal 
        of taxpayer protections; and
            (5) the Senate Finance package includes the following items 
        which were not included in the House bill--
                    (A) removal of the statutory impediments to the 
                Commissioner of Internal Revenue's efforts to 
                reorganize the agency to create a more streamlined, 
                taxpayer-friendly organization,
                    (B) the providing of real oversight authority for 
                the Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board to help 
                prevent taxpayer abuse,
                    (C) the creation of a new Treasury Inspector 
                General for Tax Administration to ensure independence 
                and accountability,
                    (D) real, meaningful relief for innocent spouses,
                    (E) provisions which abate penalties and interest 
                after 1 year so that the Internal Revenue Service does 
                not profit from its own delay,
                    (F) provisions which ensure due process of law to 
                taxpayers by granting them a right to a hearing before 
                the Internal Revenue Service can pursue a lien, levy, 
                or seizure,
                    (G) provisions which forbid the Internal Revenue 
                Service from coercing taxpayers to extend the 10-year 
                statute of limitations for collection,
                    (H) provisions which require the Internal Revenue 
                Service to terminate employees who abuse taxpayers or 
                other Internal Revenue Service employees,
                    (I) provisions which make the Taxpayer Advocate 
                more independent, and
                    (J) provisions enabling the Commissioner of 
                Internal Revenue to manage employees more effectively.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals in this budget resolution 
assume that the Senate shall, as expeditiously as possible, consider 
and pass an Internal Revenue Service restructuring bill which provides 
the most taxpayer protections, the greatest degree of Internal Revenue 
Service employee accountability, and enhanced oversight.

SEC. 302. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE SUNSET OF THE INTERNAL 
              REVENUE CODE OF 1986.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that a simple and fair Federal tax 
system is one that--
            (1) applies a low tax rate, through easily understood laws, 
        to all Americans;
            (2) provides tax relief for working Americans;
            (3) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax 
        collection abuses;
            (4) eliminates the bias against savings and investment;
            (5) promotes economic growth and job creation;
            (6) does not penalize marriage or families; and
            (7) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections process to 
        replace the Internal Revenue Service.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
provisions of this resolution assume that all taxes imposed under the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall sunset for any taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 2001 (or in the case of any tax not 
imposed on the basis of a taxable year, on any taxable event or for any 
period after December 31, 2001) and that a new Federal tax system will 
be enacted that is both simple and fair as described in subsection (a) 
and that provides only those resources for the Federal Government that 
are needed to meet its responsibilities to the American people.

SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF HOME MORTGAGE 
              INTEREST AND CHARITABLE GIVING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) current Federal income tax laws embrace a number of 
        fundamental tax policies including longstanding encouragement 
        for home ownership and charitable giving, expanded health and 
        retirement benefits;
            (2) the mortgage interest deduction is among the most 
        important incentives in the income tax code and promotes the 
        American Dream of home ownership--the single largest investment 
        for most families, and preserving it is critical for the more 
        than 20,000,000 families claiming it now and for millions more 
        in the future;
            (3) favorable tax treatment to encourage gifts to charities 
        is a longstanding principle that helps charities raise funds 
        needed to provide services to poor families and others when 
        government is simply unable or unwilling to do so, and 
        maintaining this tax incentive will help charities raise money 
        to meet the challenges of their charitable missions in the 
        decades ahead;
            (4) legislation has been proposed to repeal the entire 
        income tax code at the end of the year 2001 without providing a 
        specific replacement; and
            (5) sunsetting the entire income tax code without 
        describing a replacement threatens our Nation's future economic 
        growth and unwisely eliminates existing tax incentives that are 
        crucial for taxpayers who are often making the most important 
        financial decisions of their lives.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the levels 
in this resolution assume that Congress supports the continued tax 
deductibility of home mortgage interest and charitable contributions 
and that a sunset of the tax code that does not provide a replacement 
tax system that preserves this deductibility could damage the American 
dream of home ownership and could threaten the viability of nonprofit 
institutions.

SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRESERVATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY FOR 
              THE FUTURE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) Social Security is one of the Nation's most important 
        income security programs;
            (2) the preservation of Social Security both for those now 
        retired and for future generations of working Americans is a 
        vital national priority;
            (3) the Trustees of the Federal Old Age and Survivors 
        Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds have reported to 
        Congress that--
                    (A) the retirement of the baby boom generation will 
                cause Social Security expenditures to accelerate 
                rapidly beginning around 2010;
                    (B) Social Security expenditures will exceed Social 
                Security revenues after 2012 and the trust funds will 
                be depleted of reserves in 2029; and
                    (C) after 2029, tax revenues will be sufficient to 
                cover only three-fourths of the benefits promised under 
                current law, and, by the end of the 75 year projection 
                period, the annual deficit in the trust funds will 
                reach 2.1 percent of the GDP;
            (4) Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, 
        has testified before Congress that Social Security's unfunded 
        liability stands at around $3,000,000,000,000 and advised 
        Congress to move expeditiously to reform the program so that 
        current workers will have sufficient time to adjust to any 
        changes in the program;
            (5) the $124,000,000,000 in new domestic spending programs 
        in the President's budget undermines Social Security by 
        diverting resources from budget surpluses to a bigger 
        government and more spending; and
            (6) the Medicare Hospital Insurance program is projected to 
        become insolvent in 2010 and a study by the National Center on 
        Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University estimated 
        that 14 percent of Medicare spending in 1995 was for tobacco-
        related illnesses.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
provisions of this resolution assume that--
            (1) Congress should use unified budget surpluses to reform 
        Social Security for future generations; and
            (2) Congress should reserve the Federal proceeds from any 
        tobacco settlement for saving Medicare until legislation is 
        enacted to make Medicare actuarially sound.

SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ANNUAL STATEMENT OF ACCRUED LIABILITY 
              OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this 
resolution assume that--
            (1) the concurrent resolution on the budget should include 
        a statement of the current accrued liability of the Federal 
        Government for future payments under the Social Security and 
        Medicare programs; and
            (2) the President's budget should include for fiscal years 
        beginning with 1999 a statement of the current accrued 
        liability of the Federal Government for future payments under 
        the Social Security and Medicare programs.

SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FULL FUNDING FOR IDEA.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in this 
resolution assume that part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act 
(20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) should be fully funded at the originally 
promised level before any funds are appropriated for new education 
programs.

SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) the Social Security program, created in 1935 to provide 
        old-age survivors, and disability insurance benefits, has been 
        one of the most successful government programs ever;
            (2) in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, 
        Congress created section 13301 of the Congressional Budget Act, 
        which removed Social Security spending and revenues from all 
        Federal budget calculations;
            (3) under current budget law, the Federal budget is still 
        in deficit; and
            (4) in his State of the Union message on January 27, 1998, 
        President Clinton called on Congress to ``save Social Security 
        first'' and to ``reserve one hundred percent of the surplus, 
        that is any penny of the surplus, until we have taken all the 
        necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for 
        the twenty-first century''.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals included in this 
resolution assume--
            (1) Congress and the President should continue to rid our 
        country of debt and work to balance the budget without counting 
        Social Security trust fund surpluses; and
            (2) Congress and the President should work in a bipartisan 
        way on specific legislation to reform the Social Security 
        system, to ensure that it is financially sound over the long 
        term and will be available for all future generations.

SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SCHOOL-TO-WORK PROGRAMS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the budget totals and levels in 
this resolution assume the President's policy with respect to the 
School-to-Work program under the Education Reform Account and any such 
savings as a result should be applied to local initiatives focusing on 
early childhood development.

SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAXPAYER RIGHTS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that of revenues designated under 
section 201 for tax relief, a portion be set aside for--
            (1) improvement of taxpayer rights, including protections 
        for taxpayers in cases involving seizure of property by the 
        Internal Revenue Service; and
            (2) reform of the penalty rules under the Internal Revenue 
        Code of 1986.

SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NATIONAL GUARD FUNDING.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) The Army National Guard represents 34 percent of total 
        Army forces, including 55 percent of combat divisions and 
        brigades, 46 percent of combat support, and 25 percent of 
        combat service support.
            (2) The Army National Guard receives just 9.5 percent of 
        Army funds.
            (3) A recent military study estimates the average cost to 
        train and equip an active duty soldier is $73,000 per year, 
        while the average cost to train and equip a National Guard 
        soldier is just $17,000 per year.
            (4) The Constitution of the United States provides for a 
        specific role for the National Guard in our national defense.
            (5) The National Guard will play an increasing role in a 
        variety of ongoing worldwide operations by relieving active 
        units and reducing the operational and personnel burdens of the 
        Army's frequent and lengthy deployments.
            (6) The home land defense is a mission of growing 
        importance for our military forces and the National Guard 
        forces will play an increasingly key role in that mission.
            (7) Congress created the National Defense Panel to 
        recommend ways in which to transform United States defense and 
        national security policy for the 21st century and it reached 
        the following recommendations:
                    (A) Some portion of the Army National Guard's 
                divisional combat units (including combat support) 
                should become part of active divisions and brigades.
                    (B) The National Guard's enhanced brigades should 
                report to an active Army command.
                    (C) The Guard should develop selected early-
                deploying units that would join the active component.
                    (D) Some additional reserve or Guard units may be 
                needed to reduce pressure on the active Army.
                    (E) The Guard should assume the entire U.S. Army 
                South (USARSO) mission, the Army component of the 
                United States Southern Command (Southcom) based in 
                Panama.
                    (F) The National Guard should continue to provide 
                general purpose forces to give prompt military support 
                to civil authorities.
                    (G) The National Guard should provide forces 
                organized and equipped for training of civil agencies 
                and the immediate reinforcement of first-response 
                efforts in domestic emergencies.
                    (H) New homeland defense missions develop (e.g., 
                National Missile Defense and information warfare), the 
                Guard should be used in lieu of active forces wherever 
                possible.
            (8) The National Guard estimates it was underfunded by 
        $743,000,000 in fiscal year 1998 and by $634,000,000 in fiscal 
        year 1999.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals in the budget resolution assume that the Department 
of Defense will give the highest priority to moving toward fully 
funding the National Guard.

SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MEDICARE PAYMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) one of the goals of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was 
        to expand options for Medicare beneficiaries under the new 
        Medicare+Choice program; and
            (2) the new Medicare payment formula in the Balanced Budget 
        Act of 1997 was intended to make these choices available to all 
        Americans, but because of the low update and specific budget 
        neutrality provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the 
        blending of rates to create greater equity for rural and other 
        lower payment areas was not implemented in 1998 or 1999.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals underlying this concurrent resolution on the budget 
assume that funding the blending of local and national payment rates 
pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 should be a priority for 
the Senate Finance Committee this year within the budget as established 
by this Committee.

SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LONG-TERM CARE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) our Nation is not financially prepared to meet the 
        long-term care needs of its rapidly aging population and that 
        long-term care needs threaten the financial security of 
        American families; and
            (2) many people are unaware that most long-term care costs 
        are not covered by Medicare and that Medicaid covers long-term 
        care only after the person's assets have been exhausted.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) this concurrent resolution on the budget assumes that 
        the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare 
        should, as part of its deliberations, describe long-term care 
        needs and make all appropriate recommendations including 
        private sector options that reflect the need for a continuum of 
        care that spans from acute to long-term care. This is not a 
        specific recommendation that any new program be added to 
        Medicare;
            (2) the Federal Government should take all appropriate 
        steps to inform the public about the financial risks posed by 
        long-term care costs and about the need for families to plan 
        for their long-term care needs;
            (3) the Federal Government should take all appropriate 
        steps to inform the public that Medicare does not cover most 
        long-term care costs and that Medicaid covers long-term care 
        costs only when the beneficiary has exhausted his or her 
        assets;
            (4) the appropriate committees of the Senate, together with 
        the Department of Health and Human Services and other 
        appropriate Executive Branch agencies, should develop specific 
        ideas for encouraging Americans to plan for their own long-term 
        care needs; and
            (5) the upcoming National Summit on Retirement Income 
        Savings should ensure that planning for long-term care is an 
        integral part of any discussion of retirement security.

SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH AND OTHER 
              FUNDING.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions underlying the 
functional totals in this resolution assume the following:
            (1) To the extent that funding is made available through 
        grants or other Federal expenditures to reduce emissions of 
        carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases or to increase 
        sequestration of carbon to offset such emissions, such funding 
        shall be made available through competitive, merit-based awards 
        designed to select cost-effective methods for reducing, 
        sequestering, or mitigating such emissions. Such awards shall 
        consider all technologies, methods, and research for reducing, 
        sequestering, or mitigating emissions, including sustainable 
        agricultural practices and forest management and conservation 
        strategies. Funding criteria shall be comprehensive in scope, 
        not limited to specific technologies or industries, awarded on 
        a nondiscriminatory basis, and target cost-effectiveness in 
        reducing, sequestering, or mitigating carbon dioxide and other 
        greenhouse gases through natural resource management programs 
        or products. In considering the cost-effectiveness of various 
        reduction, sequestration, or mitigation technologies, other 
        environmental benefits should be considered.
            (2) To the extent any tax credits or other tax incentives 
        are created to stimulate the adoption of technologies or 
        practices that reduce, sequester, or mitigate emissions of 
        carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (``emissions tax 
        incentives''), such emission tax incentives shall also be 
        available to any person that employs an alternative technology 
        or practice that reduces, sequesters, or mitigates emissions of 
        carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases as effectively as 
        those technologies or practices for which a tax credit or other 
        incentive is provided. Only payments for technologies or in 
        support of practices not legally required when payment is made 
        shall qualify for tax incentives.

SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE CHILD CARE 
              AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) 54 percent of women in the labor force have children 
        under 13 and are either single parents or have husbands who 
        earn less than $30,000 per year;
            (2) in 1995, 62 percent of women with children younger than 
        age 6, and 77 percent of women with children ages 6-17 were in 
        the labor force, and 59 percent of women with children younger 
        than 3 were in the labor force;
            (3) a 1997 General Accounting Office study found that the 
        increased work participation requirements of the welfare reform 
        law will cause the need for child care to exceed the known 
        supply;
            (4) a 1995 study by the Urban Institute of child care 
        prices in 6 cities found that the average cost of care for a 2-
        year-old in a child care center ranged from $3,100 to $8,100;
            (5) for an entry-level worker, the family's child care 
        costs at the average price of care for an infant in a child 
        care center would be at least 50 percent of family income in 5 
        of the 6 cities examined;
            (6) 40 percent of children under the age of 5 are taken 
        care of at home by 1 parent;
            (7) a large number of low- and middle-income families 
        sacrifice a second full-time income so that a parent may be at 
        home with the child;
            (8) the average income of 2-parent families with a single 
        income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent 
        families with 2 incomes;
            (9) the recent National Institute for Child Health and 
        Development study found that the greatest factor in the 
        development of a young child is ``what is happening at home and 
        in families''; and
            (10) increased tax relief directed at making child care 
        more affordable, and increased funding for the Child Care and 
        Development Block Grant, would take significant steps toward 
        bringing quality child care within the reach of many parents, 
        and would increase the options available to parents in deciding 
        how best to care for their children.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the levels 
in this resolution and legislation enacted pursuant to this resolution 
assume--
            (1) that tax relief should be directed at parents who are 
        struggling to afford quality child care, including those who 
        wish to stay at home to care for a child, and should be 
        included in any tax cut package; and
            (2) doubling funding for the Child Care and Development 
        Block Grant will significantly increase the States' ability to 
        deliver quality child care to low-income working families.

SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE FORMULA CHANGE FOR FEDERAL FAMILY 
              EDUCATION LOAN.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) Postsecondary students receive critical access to a 
        higher education through student loans made available by 
        lenders in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program.
            (2) Guaranteed student loan borrowers currently pay an 
        interest rate on their FFEL loans equal to the 91-day Treasury 
        bill rate plus 2.5 percent while the borrower attends school, 
        and the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus 3.1 percent during 
        repayment. In addition, the maximum FFEL student loan rate is 
        capped at 8.25 percent.
            (3) As a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
        1993, the new formula for FFEL student loans, effective July 1, 
        1998, will be equal to the 10-year Treasury bond rate plus 1 
        percent. In addition, the same 8.25 percent rate cap would 
        apply to these new loans.
            (4) Lenders in the FFEL program have alerted Congress that 
        the scheduled formula change will make these loans 
        unprofitable. As a result, lenders may withdraw from the FFEL 
        program or significantly reduce their participation in the 
        program after July 1, 1998.
            (5) A July 25, 1997 report by the Congressional Research 
        Service stated that the scheduled formula change ``can result 
        in a greater likelihood that the program will become 
        unprofitable at certain points in the business cycle,'' and 
        ``the result could be a shutdown of the guaranteed delivery 
        system.''.
            (6) In a report by the Treasury Department on February 26, 
        1998, the Clinton Administration concluded that the new formula 
        will provide a rate of return on student loans that is below 
        the target rate of return of for-profit bank lenders in the 
        guaranteed student loan program. Furthermore, the 
        Administration concluded that there are inefficiencies 
        associated with the proposed formula, and joint benefits could 
        be realized to students and lenders from moving back to a 
        short-term index.
            (7) At the time that the proposed formula change was 
        adopted in 1993, the rate of return to lenders would have been 
        higher under the proposed formula than under the existing 
        formula.
            (8) The withdrawal of lenders from the FFEL program, who 
        now account for approximately 70 percent of all student loans, 
        would be devastating to students because, as the Administration 
        has acknowledged, the Federal direct loan program would be 
        unable to absorb the demand for student loans that would arise 
        from the absence of guaranteed lenders.
            (9) A variety of proposals have been put forward to resolve 
        this pending crisis in the FFEL program by modifying the 
        scheduled formula change.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the levels 
in this resolution and legislation enacted pursuant to this resolution 
assume that the documented problems that will rise from the scheduled 
formula change for the Federal Family Education Loan program should be 
resolved in a manner that ensures that students are not harmed by the 
withdrawal of lenders from this program.

SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF HEALTH 
              INSURANCE PREMIUMS OF THE SELF-EMPLOYED.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) under current law, the self-employed do not enjoy 
        parity with their corporate competitors with respect to the 
        deductibility of their health insurance premiums;
            (2) at present, the self-employed can deduct only 45 
        percent of their health insurance premiums;
            (3) scheduled changes in the deductible amount of health 
        insurance premiums will rise slowly, to only 60 percent by 
        2002;
            (4) only by 2007 will the self-employed enjoy equitable 
        treatment with their corporate competitors with respect to the 
        deductibility of their health insurance premiums;
            (5) the limited deductibility available to the self-
        employed greatly reduces the affordability of their health 
        insurance;
            (6) these disadvantages faced by the self-employed are 
        exacerbated by the fact that the self-employed generally pay 
        higher premium rates because they do not have access to group 
        insurance plans;
            (7) these disadvantages are reflected in the higher rate of 
        lack of insurance among self-employed individuals that stands 
        at 23.6 percent compared with 17.4 percent for all other wage 
        and salaried workers, for self-employed living at or below the 
        poverty level the rate of uninsured is over 57 percent, for 
        self-employed living at 100-150 percent poverty the rate of 
        uninsured is 47 percent, and for self-employed living at 150-
        199 percent the rate of uninsured is 40 percent;
            (8) for some self-employed, such as farmers who face 
        significant occupational safety hazards, this lack of health 
        insurance affordability has even greater ramifications; and
            (9) this lack of full deductibility is adversely affecting 
        the growing number of women who own small businesses.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume 
that legislation implementing this concurrent resolution on the budget 
should include accelerated movement toward parity between the self-
employed and corporations with respect to the tax treatment of health 
insurance premiums, while maintaining deficit neutrality.

SEC. 317. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON OBJECTION TO KYOTO PROTOCOL 
              IMPLEMENTATION PRIOR TO SENATE RATIFICATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The agreement reached by the Administration in Kyoto, 
        Japan, regarding legally binding commitments on greenhouse gas 
        reductions is inconsistent with the provisions of S. Res. 98, 
        The Byrd-Hagel Resolution, that passed the United States Senate 
        unanimously.
            (2) The Administration has pledged to Congress that it 
        would not implement any portion of the Kyoto Protocol prior to 
        its ratification in the Senate.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that funds 
should not be provided to put in effect the Kyoto Protocol prior to the 
Senate ratification in compliance with the requirements of the Byrd-
Hagel Resolution and consistent with Administration assurances to 
Congress.

SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRICE INCREASE ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS OF 
              $1.50 PER PACK.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) smoking rates among children and teenagers have reached 
        epidemic proportions;
            (2) of the 3,000 children and teenagers who begin smoking 
        every day, 1,000 will eventually die of smoking-related 
        disease; and
            (3) public health experts and economists agree that the 
        most effective and efficient way to achieve major reduction in 
        youth smoking rates is to raise the price of tobacco products 
        by at least $1.50 per pack.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
comprehensive tobacco legislation should increase the price of each 
pack of cigarettes sold by at least $1.50 through a per-pack fee or 
other mechanism that will guarantee a price increase of $1.50 per pack 
within 3 years, not including existing scheduled Federal, State, and 
local tax increases, with equivalent price increases on other tobacco 
products, and should index these price increases by an appropriate 
measure of inflation.

SEC. 319. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Congress finds that--
            (1) studies have found that quality child care, 
        particularly for infants and young children, requires a 
        sensitive, interactive, loving, and consistent caregiver;
            (2) as most parents meet and exceed the criteria described 
        in paragraph (1), circumstances allowing, parental care is the 
        best form of child care;
            (3) a recent National Institute for Child Health and 
        Development study found that the greatest factor in the 
        development of a young child is ``what is happening at home and 
        in families'';
            (4) as a child's interaction with his or her parents has 
        the most significant impact on the development of the child, 
        any Federal child care policy should enable and encourage 
        parents to spend more time with their children;
            (5) nearly \1/2\ of preschool children have at-home mothers 
        and only \1/3\ of preschool children have mothers who are 
        employed full time;
            (6) a large number of low- and middle-income families 
        sacrifice a second full-time income so that a mother may be at 
        home with her child;
            (7) the average income of 2-parent families with a single 
        income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent 
        families with 2 incomes;
            (8) only 30 percent of preschool children are in families 
        with paid child care and the remaining 70 percent of preschool 
        children are in families that do not pay for child care, many 
        of which are low- to middle-income families struggling to 
        provide child care at home;
            (9) child care proposals should not provide financial 
        assistance solely to the 30 percent of families that pay for 
        child care and should not discriminate against families in 
        which children are cared for by an at-home parent; and
            (10) any congressional proposal that increases child care 
        funding should provide financial relief to families that 
        sacrifice an entire income in order that a mother or father may 
        be at home for a young child.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
functional totals in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume 
that--
            (1) many families in the United States make enormous 
        sacrifices to forego a second income in order to have a parent 
        care for a child at home;
            (2) there should be no bias against at-home parents;
            (3) parents choose many different forms of child care to 
        meet the needs of their families, such as child care provided 
        by an at-home parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, neighbor, 
        nanny, preschool, or child care center;
            (4) any quality child care proposal should include, as a 
        key component, financial relief for those families where there 
        is an at-home parent; and
            (5) mothers and fathers who have chosen and continue to 
        choose to be at home should be applauded for their efforts.

SEC. 320. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING IMMUNITY.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this resolution 
assume that no immunity will be provided to any tobacco product 
manufacturer with respect to any health-related civil action commenced 
by a State or local governmental entity or an individual or class of 
individuals prior to or after the date of the adoption of this 
resolution.

SEC. 321. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROGRAMS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in this 
concurrent resolution assume the Secretary of Agriculture will use 
agricultural trade programs established by law to promote, to the 
maximum extent practicable, the export of United States agricultural 
commodities and products.

SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING LONG-TERM ENTITLEMENT REFORMS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the resolution assumes the 
following--
            (1) entitlement spending has risen dramatically over the 
        last thirty-five years;
            (2) in 1963, mandatory spending (i.e. entitlement spending 
        and interest on the debt) made up 30 percent of the budget, 
        this figure rose to 45 percent by 1973, to 56 percent by 1983 
        and to 61 percent by 1993;
            (3) mandatory spending is expected to make up 68 percent of 
        the Federal budget in 1998;
            (4) absent changes, that spending is expected to take up 
        over 70 percent of the Federal budget shortly after the year 
        2000 and 74 percent of the budget by the year 2008;
            (5) if no action is taken, mandatory spending will consume 
        100 percent of the budget by the year 2030;
            (6) this mandatory spending will continue to crowd out 
        spending for the traditional ``discretionary'' functions of 
        Government like clean air and water, a strong National defense, 
        parks and recreation, education, our transportation system, law 
        enforcement, research and development and other infrastructure 
        spending;
            (7) taking significant steps sooner rather than later to 
        reform entitlement spending will not only boost economic growth 
        in this country, it will also prevent the need for drastic tax 
        and spending decisions in the next century.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
levels in this budget resolution assume that Congress and the President 
should work to enact structural reforms in entitlement spending in 1998 
and beyond which sufficiently restrain the growth of mandatory spending 
in order to keep the budget in balance over the long term, extend the 
solvency of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, avoid 
crowding out funding for basic Government functions and that every 
effort should be made to hold mandatory spending to no more than 
seventy percent of the budget.

SEC. 323. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FREEDOM OF HEALTH CARE CHOICE FOR 
              MEDICARE SENIORS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Medicare beneficiaries should have the same right to 
        obtain health care from the physician or provider of their 
        choice as do Members of Congress and virtually all other 
        Americans.
            (2) Most seniors are denied this right by current 
        restrictions on their health care choices.
            (3) Affording seniors this option would create greater 
        health-care choices and result in fewer claims being paid out 
        of the near-bankrupt Medicare trust funds.
            (4) Legislation to uphold this right of health care choice 
        for seniors must protect beneficiaries and Medicare from fraud 
        and abuse. Such legislation must include provisions that--
                    (A) require that such contracts providing this 
                right be in writing, be signed by the Medicare 
                beneficiary, and provide that no claim be submitted to 
                the Health Care Financing Administration;
                    (B) preclude such contracts when the beneficiary is 
                experiencing a medical emergency;
                    (C) allow for the Medicare beneficiary to modify or 
                terminate the contract prospectively at any time and to 
                return to Medicare; and
                    (D) are subject to stringent fraud and abuse law, 
                including the Medicare anti-fraud provisions in the 
                Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
                1996.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that seniors 
have the right to see the physician or health care provider of their 
choice, and not be limited in such right by the imposition of 
unreasonable conditions on providers who are willing to treat seniors 
on a private basis, and that the assumptions underlying the functional 
totals in this resolution assume that legislation will be enacted to 
ensure this right.

SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REPAIR AND CONSTRUCTION NEEDS 
              OF INDIAN SCHOOLS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) many of our Nation's tribal schools are in a state of 
        serious disrepair. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) operates 
        187 school facilities nationwide. Enrollment in these schools, 
        which presently numbers 47,214 students, has been growing 
        rapidly. A recent General Accounting Office report indicates 
        that the repair backlog in these schools totals $754,000,000, 
        and that the BIA schools are in generally worse condition than 
        all schools nationally;
            (2) approximately 60 of these schools are in need of 
        complete replacement or serious renovation. Many of the 
        renovations include basic structural repair for the safety of 
        children, new heating components to keep students warm, and 
        roofing replacement to keep the snow and rain out of the 
        classroom. In addition to failing to provide adequate learning 
        environments for Indian children, these repair and replacement 
        needs pose a serious liability issue for the Federal 
        Government;
            (3) sixty-three percent of the BIA schools are over 30 
        years old, and 26 percent are over 50 years old. Approximately 
        40 percent of all students in BIA schools are in portable 
        classrooms. Originally intended as temporary facilities while 
        tribes awaited new construction funds, these ``portables'' have 
        a maximum 10 year life-span. Because of the construction 
        backlog, children have been shuffling between classrooms in the 
        harsh climates of the Northern plains and Western States for 10 
        to 15 years;
            (4) annual appropriations for BIA education facilities 
        replacement and repair combined have averaged $20,000,000 to 
        $30,000,000 annually, meeting only 4 percent of total need. At 
        the present rate, one deteriorating BIA school can be replaced 
        each year, with estimates of completion of nine schools in the 
        next seven years. Since the new construction and repair backlog 
        is so great and growing, the current focus at BIA construction 
        must remain on emergency and safety needs only, without 
        prioritizing program needs such as increasing enrollment or 
        technology in the classroom; and
            (5) unlike most schools, the BIA schools are a 
        responsibility of the Federal Government. Unfortunately, the 
        failure of the Federal Government to live up to this 
        responsibility has come at the expense of quality education for 
        some of this Nation's poorest children with the fewest existing 
        opportunities to better themselves.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals in this budget resolution 
assume that the repair and construction backlog affecting Bureau of 
Indian Affairs school facilities should be eliminated over a period of 
no more than 5 years beginning with fiscal year 1999, and that the 
President should submit to Congress a plan for the orderly elimination 
of this backlog.

SEC. 325. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY PERSONAL RETIREMENT 
              ACCOUNTS AND THE BUDGET SURPLUS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Social Security program is the foundation of 
        retirement income for most Americans, and solving the financial 
        problems of the Social Security program is a vital national 
        priority and essential for the retirement security of today's 
        working Americans and their families.
            (2) There is a growing bipartisan consensus that personal 
        retirement accounts should be an important feature of Social 
        Security reform.
            (3) Personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial 
        retirement nest egg and real personal wealth. For an individual 
        28 years old on the date of the adoption of this resolution, 
        earning an average wage, and retiring at age 65 in 2035, just 1 
        percent of that individual's wages deposited each year in a 
        personal retirement account and invested in securities 
        consisting of the Standard & Poors 500 would grow to $132,000, 
        and be worth approximately 20 percent of the benefits that 
        would be provided to the individual under the current 
        provisions of the Social Security program.
            (4) Personal retirement accounts would give the majority of 
        Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in 
        the economic growth of America.
            (5) Personal retirement accounts would demonstrate the 
        value of savings and the magic of compound interest to all 
        Americans. Today, Americans save less than people in almost 
        every other country.
            (6) Personal retirement accounts would help Americans to 
        better prepare for retirement generally. According to the 
        Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are not 
        actively participating in a retirement plan other than Social 
        Security, although Social Security was never intended to be the 
        sole source of retirement income.
            (7) Personal retirement accounts would allow partial 
        prefunding of retirement benefits, thereby providing for Social 
        Security's future financial stability.
            (8) The Federal budget will register a surplus of 
        $671,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, offering a unique 
        opportunity to begin a permanent solution to Social Security's 
        financing.
            (9) Using the Federal budget surplus to fund personal 
        retirement accounts would be an important first step in 
        comprehensive Social Security reform and ensuring the delivery 
        of promised retirement benefits.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that this 
resolution assumes that the Committee on Finance shall consider and 
report a legislative proposal this year that would dedicate the Federal 
budget surplus to the establishment of a program of personal retirement 
accounts for working Americans and reduce the unfunded liabilities of 
the Social Security program.

SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ELIMINATION OF THE MARRIAGE 
              PENALTY.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:
            (1) Marriage is the foundation of the American society and 
        the key institution preserving our values.
            (2) The tax code should not penalize those who choose to 
        marry.
            (3) However, the Congressional Budget Office found that 42 
        percent of married couples face a marriage penalty under the 
        current tax system.
            (4) The Congressional Budget Office found that the average 
        penalty amounts to $1,380 a year.
            (5) This penalty is one of the factors behind the decline 
        of marriage.
            (6) In 1970, just 0.5 percent of the couples in the United 
        States were unmarried. By 1996, this percentage had risen to 
        7.2 percent.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
provisions in this budget resolution assume that the Congress shall 
begin to phase out the marriage penalty this year.

SEC. 327. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING AFFORDABLE, HIGH-
              QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR SENIORS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Seniors deserve affordable, high quality health care.
            (2) The Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social 
        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) has made health care 
        affordable for millions of seniors.
            (3) Beneficiaries under the Medicare program deserve to 
        know that such program will cover the benefits that they are 
        currently entitled to.
            (4) Beneficiaries under the Medicare program can pay out-
        of-pocket for health care services whenever they--
                    (A) do not want a claim for reimbursement for such 
                services submitted to such program; or
                    (B) want or need to obtain health care services 
                that such program does not cover.
            (5) Beneficiaries under the Medicare program can use 
        doctors who do not receive any reimbursement under such 
        program.
            (6) Close to 75 percent of seniors have annual incomes 
        below $25,000, including 4 percent who have annual incomes 
        below $5,000, making any additional out-of-pocket costs for 
        health care services extremely burdensome.
            (7) Very few beneficiaries under the Medicare program 
        report having difficulty obtaining access to a physician who 
        accepts reimbursement under such program.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume 
that seniors have the right to affordable, high-quality health care, 
that they have the right to choose their physicians, and that no change 
should be made to the Medicare program that could--
            (1) impose unreasonable and unpredictable out-of-pocket 
        costs for seniors or erode the benefits that the 38,000,000 
        beneficiaries under the Medicare program are entitled to;
            (2) compromise the efforts of the Secretary of Health and 
        Human Services to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims for 
        reimbursement under such program; and
            (3) allow unscrupulous providers under such program to bill 
        twice for the same services.

SEC. 328. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PERMANENT EXTENSION OF INCOME 
              AVERAGING FOR FARMERS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the provisions of this resolution 
assume that if the revenue levels are reduced pursuant to section 201 
of this resolution for tax legislation, such amount as is necessary 
shall be used to permanently extend income averaging for farmers for 
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

SEC. 329. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO MAINTAIN FULL FUNDING FOR THE SECTION 
              202 ELDERLY HOUSING PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) The Section 202 Elderly Housing program is the most 
        important housing program for elderly, low-income Americans, 
        providing both affordable low-income housing and supportive 
        services designed to meet the special needs of the elderly.
            (2) Since 1959, the Section 202 Elderly Housing program has 
        funded some 5,400 elderly housing projects with over 330,000 
        housing units, with the current average tenant in Section 202 
        housing being a frail, older woman in her seventies, living 
        alone with an income of less than $10,000 per year.
            (3) The combination of affordable housing and supportive 
        services under the Section 202 Elderly Housing program is 
        critical to promoting independent living, self-sufficiency, and 
        dignity for the elderly while delaying more costly 
        institutional care.
            (4) There are over 1.4 million elderly Americans currently 
        identified as having ``worst case housing needs'' and in need 
        of affordable housing.
            (5) There are 33 million Americans aged 65 and over, some 
        13 percent of all Americans. The number of elderly Americans is 
        anticipated to grow to over 69 million by the year 2030, which 
        would be some 20 percent of all Americans, and continue to 
        increase to almost 80 million by 2050.
            (6) The President's Budget Request for fiscal year 1999 
        proposes reducing funding for the Section 202 Elderly Housing 
        program from the fiscal year 1998 level of $645,000,000 to 
        $109,000,000 in fiscal year 1999. This represents a reduction 
        of over 83 percent in funding, which will result in reducing 
        the construction of Section 202 housing units from some 6,000 
        units in fiscal year 1998 to only 1,500 units in fiscal year 
        1999.
            (7) The full funding of the Section 202 Elderly Housing 
        program as an independent Federal housing program is an 
        investment in our elderly citizens as well as our Nation.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
levels in this resolution assume that the Section 202 Elderly Housing 
program, as provided under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as 
amended, shall be funded in fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 
2003 at not less than the fiscal year 1998 funding level of 
$645,000,000.

SEC. 330. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OUTLAY ESTIMATES OF THE 
              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new era for 
        Federal spending and forced the Department of Defense to plan 
        on limited spending over the five-year period from fiscal year 
        1998 through 2002.
            (2) The agreements forged under the Balanced Budget Act of 
        1997 specifically defined the available amounts of budget 
        authority and outlays, requiring the Department of Defense to 
        properly plan its future activities in the new, constrained 
        budget environment.
            (3) The Department of Defense worked with the Office of 
        Management and Budget to develop a fiscal year 1999 budget 
        which complies with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
            (4) Based on Department of Defense program plans and policy 
        changes, the Office of Management and Budget and the Department 
        of Defense made detailed estimates of fiscal year 1999 
        Department of Defense outlay rates to ensure that the budget 
        submitted would comply with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
            (5) The Congressional Budget Office outlay estimate of the 
        fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense budget request exceeds 
        both the outlay limit imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 
        1997 and the Office of Management and Budget's outlay estimate, 
        a disagreement which would force a total restructuring of the 
        Department of Defense's fiscal year 1999 budget.
            (6) The restructuring imposed on the Department of Defense 
        would have a devastating impact on readiness, troop morale, 
        military quality of life, and ongoing procurement and 
        development programs.
            (7) The restructuring of the budget would be driven solely 
        by differing statistical estimates made by capable parties.
            (8) In a letter currently under review, the Director of the 
        Office of Management and Budget will identify multiple 
        differences between the Office of Management and Budget's 
        estimated outlay rates and the Congressional Budget Office's 
        estimated outlay rates.
            (9) New information on Department of Defense policy changes 
        and program execution plans now permit the Office of Management 
        and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to reevaluate 
        their initial projections of fiscal year 1999 outlay rates.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
totals underlying this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that 
not later than April 22, 1998, the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office shall complete discussions and develop a 
common estimate of the projected fiscal year 1999 outlay rates for 
Department of Defense accounts.

SEC. 331. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OUTLAY ESTIMATES FOR THE 
              BUDGETS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES OTHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
              DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Federal civilian workforce in non-Defense 
        Department agencies shrank by 125,000 employees, or 10 percent, 
        between 1992 and 1997.
            (2) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 assumed over 
        $60,000,000,000 in reductions in nondefense discretionary 
        spending over the period 1998-2002.
            (3) These reductions were agreed to notwithstanding ever-
        increasing responsibilities in agencies engaged in fighting 
        crime, combating the drug war, countering terrorist threats, 
        cleaning the environment, enforcing the law, improving 
        education, conducting health research, conducting energy 
        research and development, enhancing the Nation's physical 
        infrastructure, and providing veterans programs.
            (4) All Federal agencies have worked closely with the 
        Office of Management and Budget to balance much-needed 
        programmatic needs with fiscal prudence and to submit budget 
        requests for fiscal year 1999 that comply with the Balanced 
        Budget Act of 1997.
            (5) Reductions in the President's requests, as estimated by 
        the Office of Management and Budget, to comply with the 
        Congressional Budget Office's estimates could seriously 
        jeopardize priority domestic discretionary programs.
            (6) There is no mechanism through which the Congressional 
        Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget identify 
        their differences in outlay rates for nondefense agencies.
            (7) Such consultation would lead to greater understanding 
        between the two agencies and potentially fewer and/or smaller 
        differences in the future.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
totals underlying this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that 
not later than April 22, 1998, the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in 
consultation with the Secretaries of the affected nondefense agencies, 
shall complete discussions and develop a common estimate of the 
projected fiscal year 1999 outlay rates for accounts in nondefense 
agencies.

SEC. 332. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN EVALUATION OF THE OUTCOME OF 
              WELFARE REFORM.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in this 
resolution assume that--
            (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services will, as 
        part of the annual report to Congress under section 411 of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 611), include data regarding the 
        rate of employment, job retention, and earnings characteristics 
        of former recipients of assistance under the State programs 
        funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 401 et seq.) for each such State program; and
            (2) for purposes of the annual report for fiscal year 1997, 
        the information described in paragraph (1) will be transmitted 
        to Congress not later than September 1, 1998.

SEC. 333. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL 
              BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR LONG-TERM CARE WORKERS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation 
        will greatly increase the demand and need for quality long-term 
        care and it is incumbent on Congress and the President to 
        ensure that Medicare and Medicaid patients are protected from 
        abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.
            (2) Although the majority of long-term care facilities do 
        an excellent job in caring for elderly and disabled patients, 
        incidents of abuse and neglect and mistreatment do occur at an 
        unacceptable rate and are not limited to nursing homes alone.
            (3) Current Federal and State safeguards are inadequate 
        because there is little or no information sharing between 
        States about known abusers and no common State procedures for 
        tracking abusers from State to State and facility to facility.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals in this concurrent 
resolution on the budget assume that a national registry of abusive 
long-term care workers should be established by building upon existing 
infrastructures at the Federal and State levels that would enable long-
term care providers who participate in the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.) to conduct background 
checks on prospective employees.

SEC. 334. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EXPANDING MEDICARE BENEFITS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) In the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement, changes were 
        made to Medicare that extended the solvency of the Trust Fund 
        for 10 years.
            (2) The Medicare Commission, also established in the 
        Balanced Budget Agreement, has just started the task of 
        examining the Medicare program in an effort to make sound 
        policy recommendations to Congress and the Administration about 
        what needs to be done to ensure that Medicare is financially 
        prepared to handle the added burden when the baby boomers begin 
        retiring.
            (3) The problems facing Medicare are not about more 
        revenues. The program needs to do more to improve the health 
        care status of retirees and give them more choices and better 
        information to make wise consumer decisions when purchasing 
        health care services.
            (4) Improving the health care status of senior citizens 
        would ensure additional savings for Medicare. Helping seniors 
        stay healthier should be a priority of any legislation aimed at 
        protecting Medicare.
            (5) In order to keep seniors healthier, Medicare has to 
        become more prevention based. Currently, Medicare offers 
        prevention benefits, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made a 
        substantial investment in prevention benefits, providing 
        $8,500,000,000 over 10 years.
            (6) Preventing illnesses or long hospital stays or repeated 
        hospital stays will save Medicare dollars.
            (7) Medicare cannot be saved without structural changes and 
        reforms.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals underlying this resolution assume that the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997 directed the National Bipartisan Commission on the 
future of Medicare to examine Medicare's benefit structure, including 
prevention benefits, and make recommendations to the Congress on such 
benefits in the context of an overall plan to extend the solvency of 
the program.

SEC. 335. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BATTLEFIELD PRESERVATION.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the budget levels in this 
resolution assume that--
            (1) preserving Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil 
        War battlefields is an integral part of preserving our Nation's 
        history;
            (2) the Secretary of the Interior should give special 
        priority to the preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 
        1812 battlefields, by making funds available for the conduct of 
        the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Historic Preservation 
        Study as authorized by section 603 of Public Law 104-333 (16 
        U.S.C. 1a-5 note); and
            (3) the Secretary of the Interior should give special 
        priority to the preservation of Revolutionary War, War of 1812, 
        and Civil War battlefields by allocating funds in the Land and 
        Water Conservation Fund for the purchase of battlefield sites 
        the integrity of which is threatened by urban or suburban 
        development.

SEC. 336. A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE SENATE'S SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL, 
              STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) our Federal, State and local law enforcement officers 
        provide essential services that preserve and protect our 
        freedom and safety, and with the support of Federal assistance, 
        State and local law enforcement officers have succeeded in 
        reducing the national scourge of violent crime, illustrated by 
        a murder rate in 1996 which is projected to be the lowest since 
        1971 and a violent crime total in 1996 which is the lowest 
        since 1990;
            (2) through a comprehensive effort to attack violence 
        against women mounted by State and local law enforcement, and 
        dedicated volunteers and professionals who provide victim 
        services, shelter, counseling and advocacy to battered women 
        and their children, important strides have been made against 
        the national scourge of violence against women, illustrated by 
        the decline in the murder rate for wives, ex-wives and 
        girlfriends at the hands of their ``intimates'' fell to a 19-
        year low in 1995;
            (3) recent gains by Federal, State and local law 
        enforcement in the fight against violent crime and violence 
        against women are fragile, and continued financial commitment 
        from the Federal Government for funding and financial 
        assistance is required to sustain and build upon these gains; 
        and
            (4) the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as adopted by 
        the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 funds 
        the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the 
        Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and the Antiterrorism and 
        Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 without adding to the 
        Federal budget deficit.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
provisions and the functional totals underlying this resolution assume 
the Federal Government's commitment to fund Federal law enforcement 
programs and programs to assist State and local efforts to combat 
violent crime, including violence against women, shall be maintained 
and funding for the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund shall continue 
to at least fiscal year 2003.

SEC. 337. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ANALYSIS OF CIVILIAN SCIENCE AND 
              TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) The National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of 
        Engineering, and Institute of Medicine have recommended, in 
        their 1995 report, entitled ``Allocating Federal Funds for 
        Science and Technology'', that the Federal science and 
        technology budget ``be presented as a comprehensive whole in 
        the President's budget and similarly considered as a whole at 
        the beginning of the congressional budget process before the 
        total Federal budget is disaggregated and sent to the 
        appropriations committees and subcommittees''.
            (2) Civilian Federal agencies are supporting more than 
        $35,000,000,000 of research and development in fiscal year 
        1998, but it is difficult for the Congress and the public to 
        track or understand this support because it is dispersed among 
        12 different budget functions.
            (3) A meaningful examination of the overall Federal budget 
        for science and technology, consistent with the recommendation 
        of the National Academies, as well as an examination of science 
        and technology budgets in individual civilian agencies, would 
        be facilitated if the President's budget request clearly 
        displayed the amounts requested for science and technology 
        programs across all civilian agencies and classified these 
        amounts in Budget Function 250.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
congressional budget for the United States for fiscal years 2000, 2001, 
2002, 2003, and 2004 should consolidate the spending for all Federal 
civilian science and technology programs in Budget Function 250, and 
that the President should accordingly transmit to the Congress a budget 
request for fiscal year 2000 that classifies these programs, across all 
Federal civilian departments and agencies, in Budget Function 250.

SEC. 338. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CIVILIAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
              PROGRAMS IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions underlying the 
function totals in this budget resolution assume that expenditures for 
civilian science and technology programs in the Federal budget will 
double over the period from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2008.

SEC. 339. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LONG-TERM BUDGETING AND REPAYMENT OF 
              THE PUBLIC DEBT.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) today, there are 34,000,000 Americans over the age of 
        65, and by the year 2030, that number will grow to nearly 
        70,000,000;
            (2) in 1963, mandatory spending represented 30 percent of 
        the Federal budget, while discretionary spending made up 70 
        percent, and by 1998, those proportions have almost completely 
        reversed, in that mandatory spending now accounts for 68 
        percent of the Federal budget, while discretionary spending 
        represents 32 percent;
            (3) according to the 1997 Annual Report of the Board of 
        Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and 
        Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Fund--
                    (A) the difference between the income and benefits 
                for the OASDI program is a deficit of 2.23 percent of 
                taxable payroll;
                    (B) the assets in the Trust Fund are expected to be 
                depleted under present law in the year 2029;
                    (C) by the time the assets in the Trust Fund are 
                depleted, annual tax revenues will be sufficient to 
                cover only three-fourths of the annual expenditures;
                    (D) intermediate estimates are that OASDI will 
                absorb nearly 17.5 percent of national payroll by the 
                year 2030; and
                    (E) the cost of the OASDI program is estimated to 
                rise from its current level of 4.7 percent of Gross 
                Domestic Product to 6.7 percent by the end of the 75-
                year projection period;
            (4) according to reports by the Congressional Budget 
        Office, the Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1999-2008 
        (January 1998) and Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue 
        Options (March 1997)--
                    (A) the Medicare Part A Trust Fund will be 
                exhausted early in fiscal year 2010;
                    (B) enrollment in Medicare will increase 
                dramatically as the baby boomers reach age 65;
                    (C) between the years 2010 and 2030, enrollment in 
                Medicare is projected to grow by 2.4 percent per year, 
                up from the 1.4 percent average annual growth projected 
                through 2007;
                    (D) by the year 2030, Medicare enrollment will have 
                doubled, to 75,000,000 people; and
                    (E) the increase in Medicare enrollment caused by 
                the aging of the population will be accompanied by a 
                tapering of the growth rate of the working age 
                population, and the number of workers will drop from 
                3.8 for every Medicare beneficiary in 1997 to 2.02 per 
                beneficiary by 2030;
            (5) the demographic shift that is currently taking place, 
        and will continue for the next 30 years, will put a tremendous 
        burden on workers as the cost of programs such as Social 
        Security and Medicare are borne by proportionately fewer 
        workers;
            (6) the current Budget Resolution, which projects revenues 
        and spending only for the next 10 years, does not give Congress 
        a clear picture of the budget problems that confront the United 
        States shortly after the turn of the century;
            (7) currently, 14 percent of the Federal budget is spent on 
        interest payments on the national debt; and
            (8) if projected surpluses are used entirely for debt 
        reduction and current tax and spending policies remain 
        unchanged, the share of Federal income needed to pay interest 
        would drop below 5 percent within 12 years, and in 1997, that 
        10 percentage-point reduction would have amounted to 
        $158,000,000,000 available for other priorities.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals in this concurrent resolution assume that future 
budget resolutions and future budgets submitted by the President should 
include--
            (1) an analysis for the period of 30 fiscal years beginning 
        with such fiscal year, of the estimated levels of total budget 
        outlays and total new budget authority, the estimated revenues 
        to be received, the estimated surplus or deficit, if any, for 
        each major Federal entitlement program for each fiscal year in 
        such period; and
            (2) a specific accounting of payments, if any, made to 
        reduce the public debt, or unfunded liabilities associated with 
        each major Federal entitlement program.

SEC. 340. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PRESIDENT'S BUDGET.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in this 
resolution assume that the President should submit, as part of the 
budget request of the President that is submitted to Congress, a study 
of the impact of the provisions of the budget on each generation of 
Americans and its long-term effects on each generation.

SEC. 341. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE VALUE OF THE SOCIAL 
              SECURITY SYSTEM FOR FUTURE RETIREES.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Social Security system has allowed a generation of 
        Americans to retire with dignity. Today, 13 percent of the 
        population is 65 or older and by 2030, 20 percent of the 
        population will be 65 or older. More than \1/2\ of the elderly 
        do not receive private pensions and more than \1/3\ have no 
        income from assets.
            (2) For 60 percent of all senior citizens, Social Security 
        benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement income. 
        For 80 percent of all senior citizens, Social Security benefits 
        provide over 50 percent of their retirement income.
            (3) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level 
        since the United States began to keep poverty statistics, due 
        in large part to the Social Security system.
            (4) 78 percent of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than 
        they do in income taxes.
            (5) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee 
        for the Social Security trust funds, the accumulated balance in 
        the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is 
        estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll 
        tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent of 
        the benefits owed to retirees at that time.
            (6) The average American retiring in the year 2015 will pay 
        $250,000 in payroll taxes over the course of a working career.
            (7) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the 
        same value from the Social Security system as past covered 
        recipients.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
budgetary levels in this resolution assume that no change in the Social 
Security system should be made that would reduce the value of the 
Social Security system for future generations of retirees.

SEC. 342. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the budget levels in this 
resolution assume that programs funded from the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund should be funded in the full amount authorized by 
law.

SEC. 343. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EDUCATION GOALS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals underlying 
this resolution assume that the Federal Government should work hand-in-
hand with States, school districts, and local leaders--
            (1) to accomplish the following goals by the year 2005:
                    (A) establish achievement levels and assessments in 
                every grade for the core academic curriculum; measure 
                each regular student's performance; and prohibit the 
                practice of social promotion of students (promoting 
                students routinely from one grade to the next without 
                regard to their academic achievement);
                    (B) provide remedial programs for students whose 
                achievement levels indicate they should not be promoted 
                to the next grade;
                    (C) create smaller schools to enable students to 
                have closer interaction with teachers;
                    (D) require at least 180 days per year of 
                instruction in core curriculum subjects;
                    (E) recruit new teachers who are adequately trained 
                and credentialed in the subject or subjects they teach 
                and encourage excellent, experienced teachers to remain 
                in the classroom by providing adequate salaries; 
                require all teachers to be credentialed and limit 
                emergency or temporary teaching credentials to a 
                limited period of time; hold teachers and principals 
                accountable to high educational standards; and
                    (F) require all regular students to pass an 
                examination in basic core curriculum subjects in order 
                to receive a high school diploma; and
            (2) to reaffirm the importance of public schooling and 
        commit to guaranteeing excellence and accountability in the 
        public schools of this Nation.

SEC. 344. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) while it is important to study the effects of class 
        size on learning and study the need to hire more teachers, each 
        type of study must be carried out in conjunction with an effort 
        to ensure that there will be quality teachers in every 
        classroom;
            (2) all children deserve well-educated teachers;
            (3) there is a teacher quality crisis in the United States;
            (4) individuals entering a classroom as teachers should 
        have a sound grasp on the subject the individuals intend to 
        teach, and the individuals should know how to teach;
            (5) less than 40 percent of the individuals teaching core 
        subjects (consisting of English, mathematics, science, social 
        studies, and foreign languages) majored or minored in the core 
        subjects;
            (6) the quality of teachers impacts student achievement;
            (7) the measure of a good teacher is how much and how well 
        the teacher's students learn;
            (8) teachers should have the opportunity to learn new 
        technology and teaching methods through the establishment of 
        teacher training facilities so that teachers can share their 
        new knowledge and experiences with children in the classroom;
            (9) school officials should have the flexibility the 
        officials need to have teachers in their schools adequately 
        trained to meet strenuous teacher standards;
            (10) knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character 
        and various professional backgrounds should be encouraged to 
        enter kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as teachers; and
            (11) States should have maximum flexibility and incentives 
        to create alternative teacher certification and licensure 
        programs in order to recruit well-educated people into the 
        teaching profession.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume--
            (1) the enactment of legislation to provide assistance for 
        programs that--
                    (A) focus on teacher training delivered through 
                local partnerships, with private and public partners, 
                to ensure that current and future teachers possess 
                necessary teaching skills and knowledge of subject 
                areas; and
                    (B) focus on alternative certification to recruit 
                knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character 
                to enter kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as 
                teachers;
            (2) that the quality of teachers can be strengthened by 
        improving the academic knowledge of teachers in the subject 
        areas in which the teachers teach;
            (3) that institutions of higher education should be held 
        accountable to prepare teachers who are highly competent in the 
        subject areas in which the teachers teach, including preparing 
        teachers by providing training in the effective uses of 
        technologies in classrooms; and
            (4) that there should be recruitment into teaching of high 
        quality individuals, including individuals from other 
        occupations.

SEC. 345. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INS CIRCUIT RIDERS IN THE FORMER 
              SOVIET UNION.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this 
resolution assume that included in the funding for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS) is $2,000,000 for the establishment of INS 
circuit riders in the former Soviet Union for the purpose of processing 
refugees and conducting medical examinations of refugees who will enter 
the United States under the Refugee Act of 1980.

SEC. 346. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR THE AIRPORT 
              IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the congressional budget for the 
United States Government as provided for in this resolution should 
assure that--
            (1) the contract authority level for the Airport 
        Improvement Program (provided for in part B of subtitle VII of 
        title 49, United States Code) not be reduced below the current 
        level of $2,347,000,000; and
            (2) the critical infrastructure development, maintenance, 
        and repair of airports not be jeopardized.

SEC. 347. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTH CONGRESS, 
              SECOND SESSION SHOULD REAUTHORIZE FUNDS FOR THE FARMLAND 
              PROTECTION PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--
            (1) eighteen States and dozens of localities have spent 
        nearly $1,000,000,000 to protect over 600,000 acres of 
        important farmland;
            (2) the Farmland Protection Program has provided cost-
        sharing for 18 States and dozens of localities to protect over 
        82,000 acres on 230 farms since 1996;
            (3) the Farmland Protection Program has generated new 
        interest in saving farmland in communities around the country;
            (4) the Farmland Protection Program represents an 
        innovative and voluntary partnership, rewards local ingenuity, 
        and supports local priorities;
            (5) current funds authorized for the Farmland Protection 
        Program will be exhausted in the next six months;
            (6) the United States is losing two acres of our best 
        farmland to development every minute of every day;
            (7) these lands produce three quarters of the fruits and 
        vegetables and over one half of the dairy in the United States.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals contained in this resolution assume that the One 
Hundred Fifth Congress, Second Session will reauthorize funds for the 
Farmland Protection Program.

SEC. 348. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE QUALITY.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--
            (1) out of a total 549 plans under the Federal Employees 
        Health Benefits Program, which includes fee-for-service, point 
        of service, and Health Maintenance Organizations, only 186 were 
        fully accredited;
            (2) out of a total 549 plans under the Federal Employees 
        Health Benefits Program, which includes fee-for-service, point 
        of service, and Health Maintenance Organizations, 7 were denied 
        accreditation.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying this resolution provide for the enactment of 
legislation requiring all health plans participating in the Federal 
Employees Health Benefits Program to be accredited by a nationally 
recognized accreditation organization representative of a spectrum of 
health care interests including purchasers, consumers, providers and 
health plans.

SEC. 349. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING WASTEFUL SPENDING IN DEFENSE 
              DEPARTMENT ACQUISITION PRACTICES.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) according to the Defense Department's Inspector 
        General, despite efforts to streamline Government purchases, 
        the military, in some cases, paid more than ``fair value'' for 
        many items;
            (2) efficient purchasing policies, in the context of 
        decreasing defense budgets, are more important than ever to 
        ensure Defense Department spending contributes to military 
        readiness.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
provisions of this resolution assume that the Defense Department should 
continue efforts to eliminate wasteful spending such that defense 
spending allocated in the fiscal year 1999 budget, and all subsequent 
budgets, is spent in the manner most efficient to maintain and promote 
military readiness for United States Armed Forces around the globe.

SEC. 350. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES RESPONSE TO 
              THE CHANGING NATURE OF TERRORISM.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) the threat of terrorism to American citizens and 
        interests remains high, with Americans suffering one-third of 
        the total terrorist attacks in the world in 1997;
            (2) the terrorist threat is changing--while past acts were 
        generally limited to the use of conventional explosives and 
        weapons, terrorists today are exploiting technological advances 
        and increasingly lethal tools and strategies to pursue their 
        agenda;
            (3) on a worldwide basis, terrorists are focusing on 
        afflicting mass casualties on civilian targets through the 
        acquisition of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of mass 
        destruction;
            (4) chemical and biological weapons in the hands of 
        terrorists or rogue nations constitute a threat to the United 
        States;
            (5) the multifaceted nature of the terrorist threat 
        encompasses not only foreign terrorists targeting American 
        citizens and interests abroad, but foreign terrorists operating 
        within the United States itself, as well as domestic 
        terrorists;
            (6) terrorists groups are becoming increasingly 
        multinational, more associated with criminal activity, and less 
        responsive to external influences;
            (7) terrorists exploit America's free and open society to 
        illegally enter the country, raise funds, recruit new members, 
        spread propaganda, and plan future activities;
            (8) terrorists are also making use of computer technology 
        to communicate, solicit money and support, and store 
        information essential to their operations;
            (9) State sponsors of terrorism and other foreign countries 
        are known to be developing computer intrusion and manipulation 
        capabilities which could pose a threat to essential public and 
        private information systems in the United States;
            (10) the infrastructures deemed critical to the United 
        States are the telecommunications networks, the electric power 
        grid, oil and gas distribution, water distribution facilities, 
        transportation systems, financial networks, emergency services, 
        and the continuity of Government services, the disruption of 
        which could result in significant losses to the United States 
        economic well-being, public welfare, or national security;
            (11) a national strategy of infrastructure protection, as 
        required by the Defense Appropriations Act of 1996, and 
        subsequent amendments, has yet to be issued; and
            (12) we as a Nation remain fundamentally unprepared to 
        respond in a coordinated and effective manner to these growing 
        terrorist threats.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
provisions of this resolution assume that--
            (1) the Federal Government must take the lead in 
        establishing effective coordination between intelligence-
        gathering and law enforcement agencies, among Federal, State, 
        and local levels of Government, and with the private sector, 
        for the purpose of assessing, warning, and protecting against 
        terrorist attacks;
            (2) technical preparedness for the detection and analysis 
        of chemical and biological weapons, and for swift and adequate 
        emergency response to their use by terrorists, must be a near-
        term continuing priority;
            (3) the United States must seek full international 
        cooperation in securing the capture and conviction of 
        terrorists who attack or pose a threat to American citizens and 
        interests;
            (4) the United States should fully enforce its laws 
        intended to deny foreign terrorist organizations the ability to 
        raise money in the United States, prevent the evasion of our 
        immigration laws and furthering of criminal activities, and 
        curtail the use of our country as a base of operations; and
            (5) a national strategy, adequate to addressing the 
        complexity of protecting our critical infrastructures, and as 
        required by the Defense Appropriations Act of 1996 and 
        subsequent amendments, must be completed and implemented 
        immediately.

SEC. 351. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, SOCIAL SECURITY, AND 
              GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals underlying 
this resolution assume that--
            (1) the elimination of a discretionary spending program may 
        be used for either tax cuts or to reform the Social Security 
        system;
            (2) the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Balanced 
        Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and other 
        appropriate budget rules and laws should be amended to 
        implement the policy stated in paragraph (1).

SEC. 352. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SUPERMAJORITY REQUIREMENT FOR 
              RAISING TAXES.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) the Nation's current tax system is indefensible, being 
        overly complex, burdensome, and severely limiting to economic 
        opportunity for all Americans;
            (2) fundamental tax reform should be undertaken as soon as 
        practicable to produce a tax system that--
                    (A) applies a low tax rate, through easily 
                understood laws, to all Americans;
                    (B) provides tax relief for working Americans;
                    (C) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces 
                tax collection abuses;
                    (D) eliminates the bias against savings and 
                investment;
                    (E) promotes economic growth and job creation;
                    (F) does not penalize marriage or families; and
                    (G) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections 
                process to replace the Internal Revenue Service; and
            (3) the stability and longevity of any new tax system 
        designed to achieve these goals should be guaranteed with a 
        supermajority vote requirement so that Congress cannot easily 
        raise tax rates, impose new taxes, or otherwise increase the 
        amount of a taxpayer's income that is subject to tax.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals of this resolution assume 
fundamental tax reform that is accompanied by a proposal to amend the 
Constitution of the United States to require a supermajority vote in 
each House of Congress to approve tax increases.

SEC. 353. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE QUALITY.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Rapid changes in the health care marketplace have 
        compromised confidence in the our Nation's health system.
            (2) American consumers want more convenience, fewer 
        hassles, more choices, and better service from their health 
        insurance plans.
            (3) All Americans deserve quality-driven health care 
        supported by sound science and evidence-based medicine.
            (4) The Federal Government, through the National Institutes 
        of Health, supports research that improves the quality of 
        medical care that Americans receive.
            (5) This resolution assumes increased funding for the 
        National Institutes of Health for 1999 of $15,100,000,000, an 
        11-percent increase over current funding levels, which are 7 
        percent higher than in 1997.
            (6) As the largest purchaser of health care services, the 
        Federal Government has a responsibility to utilize its 
        purchasing power to demand high quality health plans and 
        providers for its health programs and to protect its 
        beneficiaries from inferior medical care.
            (7) The Federal Government must adopt the posture of 
        private sector purchasers and insist on high quality care for 
        the 67,000,000 Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and the 
        9,000,000 Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents.
            (8) The private sector has proven to be more capable of 
        keeping pace with the rapid changes in health care delivery and 
        medical practice that affect quality of care considerations 
        than the Federal Government.
            (9) As Congress considers health care legislation, it must 
        first commit to ``do no harm'' to health care quality, 
        consumers, and the evolving market place. Rushing to legislate 
        or regulate based on anecdotal information and micro-managing 
        health plans on politically popular issues will not solve the 
        problems of consumer confidence and the quality of our health 
        care system.
            (10) When health insurance premiums rise, Americans lose 
        health coverage. Studies indicate that a 1 percent increase in 
        private health insurance premiums will be associated with an 
        increase in the number of persons without insurance of about 
        400,000 persons.
            (11) Health care costs have begun to rise significantly in 
        the past year. The Congressional Budget Office (referred to as 
        ``CBO'') projects that the growth in health premiums will be 
        5.5 percent in 1998 up from 3.8 percent in 1997. CBO continues 
        to project that premiums will grow about 1 percentage point 
        faster than the Gross Domestic Product in the longer run. CBO 
        also warns that new Federal mandates on health insurance could 
        exacerbate this increase in premiums.
            (12) The President's Advisory Commission on Consumer 
        Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry developed 
        the Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. This includes 
        information disclosure, confidentiality of health information, 
        and choice of providers.
            (13) The President's Commission further determined that 
        private sector organizations have the capacity to act in a 
        timely manner needed to keep pace with the swiftly evolving 
        health system.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying this resolution assume that the Senate will not 
pass any health care legislation that will--
            (1) make health insurance unaffordable for working families 
        and increase the number of uninsured Americans;
            (2) divert limited health care resources away from serving 
        patients to paying lawyers and hiring new bureaucrats; or
            (3) impose political considerations on clinical decisions, 
        instead of allowing such decisions to be made on the basis of 
        sound science and the best interests of patients.

SEC. 354. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE USE OF BUDGET SURPLUS FOR TAX 
              RELIEF OR DEBT REDUCTION.

    It is the sense of the Senate that this resolution assumes that any 
budget surplus should be dedicated to debt reduction or direct tax 
relief for hard-working American families.

SEC. 355. USE OF BUDGET SURPLUS TO REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions underlying the 
functional totals included in the resolution assume:
            (1) The Congress and the President should use any budget 
        surplus to reduce the Social Security payroll tax and to 
        establish personal retirement accounts with the tax reduction 
        for hard-working Americans.
            (2) The Congress and the President should not use the 
        Social Security surplus to finance general Government programs 
        and other spending, should begin to build real assets for the 
        trust funds, and work to reform the Social Security system.

SEC. 356. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COLOMBIAN DRUG WAR HELICOPTERS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) Colombia is the leading illicit drug producing country 
        in the Western Hemisphere;
            (2) 80 percent of the world's cocaine originates in 
        Colombia;
            (3) based on the most recent data of the Drug Enforcement 
        Administration (DEA), more than 60 percent of the heroin seized 
        in the United States originates in Colombia;
            (4) in the last 10 years more than 4,000 officers of the 
        Colombian National Police have died fighting the scourge of 
        drugs;
            (5) in one recent year alone, according to data of the 
        United States Government, the United States had 141,000 new 
        heroin users and the United States faces historic levels of 
        heroin use among teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17;
            (6) once Colombian heroin is in the stream of commerce it 
        is nearly impossible to interdict because it is concealed and 
        trafficked in very small quantities;
            (7) the best and most cost efficient method of preventing 
        Colombian heroin from entering the United States is to destroy 
        the opium poppies in the high Andes mountains where Colombian 
        heroin is produced;
            (8) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian National 
        Police has the responsibility to eradicate both coca and opium 
        in Colombia, including the reduction and elimination of cocaine 
        and heroin production, and they have done a remarkably 
        effective job with the limited and outdated equipment at their 
        disposal;
            (9) more than 40 percent of the anti-narcotics operations 
        of the Colombian National Police involve hostile ground fire 
        from narco-terrorists and 90 percent of such operations involve 
        the use of helicopters;
            (10) the need for better high performance helicopters by 
        the Colombian National Police, especially for use in the high 
        Andes mountains, is essential for more effective eradication of 
        opium in Colombia;
            (11) on December 23, 1997, one of the antiquated Vietnam-
        era UH-1H Huey helicopters used by the Colombian National 
        Police in an opium eradication mission crashed in the high 
        Andes mountains due to high winds and because it was flying 
        above the safety level recommended by the original 
        manufacturer;
            (12) in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and 
        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 105-118), 
        amounts were appropriated for the procurement by the United 
        States for the Colombian National Police of three UH-60L 
        Blackhawk utility helicopters that can operate safely and more 
        effectively at the high altitudes of the Andes mountains where 
        Colombian opium grows at altitudes as high as 12,000 feet;
            (13) the Blackhawk helicopter is a high performance utility 
        helicopter, with greater lift capacity, that can perform at the 
        high altitudes of the Andes mountains, as well as survive 
        crashes and sustain ground fire, much better than any other 
        utility helicopter now available to the Colombian National 
        Police in the war on drugs;
            (14) because the Vietnam-era Huey helicopters that the 
        United States has provided the Colombian National Police are 
        outdated and have been developing numerous stress cracks, a 
        sufficient number should be upgraded to Huey II's and the 
        remainder should be phased-out as soon as possible;
            (15) these Huey helicopters are much older than most of the 
        pilots who fly them, do not have the range due to limited fuel 
        capacity to reach many of the expanding locations of the coca 
        fields or cocaine labs in southern Colombia, nor do they have 
        the lift capacity to carry enough armed officers to reach and 
        secure the opium fields in the high Andes mountains prior to 
        eradication;
            (16) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian 
        National Police has a stellar record in respecting for human 
        rights and has received the commendation of a leading 
        international human rights group in their operations to reduce 
        and eradicate illicit drugs in Colombia;
            (17) the narco-terrorists of Colombia have announced that 
        they will now target United States citizens, particularly those 
        United States citizens working with their Colombian 
        counterparts in the fight against illicit drugs in Colombia;
            (18) a leading commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
        of Colombia (``FARC'') announced recently that the objective of 
        these narco-terrorists, in light of recent successes, will be 
        ``to defeat the Americans'';
            (19) United States Government personnel in Colombia who fly 
        in these helicopters accompanying the Colombian National Police 
        on missions are now at even greater risk from these narco-
        terrorists and their drug trafficking allies;
            (20) in the last six months four anti-narcotics helicopters 
        of the Colombian National Police have been downed in 
        operations;
            (21) Congress intends to provide the necessary support and 
        assistance to wage an effective war on illicit drugs in 
        Colombia and provide the equipment and assistance needed to 
        protect all of the men and women of the Colombian National 
        Police as well as those Americans who work side by side with 
        the Colombian National Police in this common struggle against 
        illicit drugs;
            (22) the new Government of Bolivia has made a commitment to 
        eradicate coca and cocaine production in that country within 5 
        years;
            (23) the United States should support any country that is 
        interested in removing the scourge of drugs from its citizens; 
        and
            (24) Bolivia has succeeded, in large measure due to United 
        States assistance, in reducing acreage used to produce coca, 
        which is the basis for cocaine production.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals underlying this resolution assume that--
            (1) the President should, with funds made available under 
        Public Law 105-118, expeditiously procure and provide to the 
        Colombian National Police three UH-60L Blackhawk utility 
        helicopters solely for the purpose of assisting the Colombian 
        National Police to perform their responsibilities to reduce and 
        eliminate the production of illicit drugs in Colombia and the 
        trafficking of such illicit drugs, including the trafficking of 
        drugs such as heroin and cocaine to the United States;
            (2) if the President determines that the procurement and 
        transfer to the Colombian National Police of three UH-60L 
        Blackhawk utility helicopters is not an adequate number of such 
        helicopters to maintain operational feasibility and 
        effectiveness of the Colombian National Police, then the 
        President should promptly inform Congress as to the appropriate 
        number of additional UH-60L Blackhawk utility helicopters for 
        the Colombian National Police so that amounts can be authorized 
        for the procurement and transfer of such additional 
        helicopters; and
            (3) assistance for Bolivia should be maintained at least at 
        the level assumed in the fiscal year 1998 budget submission of 
        the President and the Administration should act accordingly.

SEC. 357. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR MEDICAL CARE FOR VETERANS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals underlying 
this resolution assume that $40,274,000 in additional amounts above the 
President's budget levels will be made available for veterans health 
care for fiscal year 1999.

SEC. 358. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON OBJECTION TO THE USE OF THE SALE OF 
              PUBLIC LANDS TO FUND CERTAIN PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the Budget Committee Report 
accompanying this resolution assumes that the landowner incentive 
program of the Endangered Species Recovery Act would be funded ``from 
the gross receipts realized in the sales of excess BLM land: Provided, 
That BLM has sufficient administrative funds to conduct such sales''.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals underlying this resolution assume that--
            (1) the landowner incentive program included in the 
        Endangered Species Recovery Act should be financed from a 
        dedicated source of funding; and
            (2) public lands should not be sold to fund the landowner 
        incentive program of the Endangered Species Recovery Act 
        through their proceeds alone, if subsequent legislation 
        provides an alternative or mixed, dedicated source of mandatory 
        funding.

SEC. 359. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A MULTINATIONAL ALLIANCE 
              AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) the traffic in illegal drugs greatly threatens 
        democracy, security and stability in the Western Hemisphere due 
        to the violence and corruption associated with drug trafficking 
        organizations;
            (2) drug trafficking organizations operate without respect 
        for borders or national sovereignty;
            (3) the production, transport, sale, and use of illicit 
        drugs endangers the people and legitimate institutions of all 
        countries in the hemisphere;
            (4) no single country can successfully confront and defeat 
        this common enemy;
            (5) full bilateral cooperation with the United States to 
        reduce the flow of drugs is in the national interests of our 
        neighbors in the hemisphere;
            (6) in addition, victory in the hemispheric battle against 
        drug traffickers requires expanded multilateral cooperation 
        among the nations of the region.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
provisions of this resolution assume that in addition to existing 
bilateral cooperative efforts, the Administration should promote at the 
Summit of the Americas and in other fora the concept of a multinational 
hemispheric ``war alliance'' bringing together the United States and 
key illicit drug producing and transiting countries in the Western 
Hemisphere for the purpose of implementing a coordinated plan of action 
against illegal drug trafficking and promoting full cooperation against 
this common menace.

SEC. 360. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LEGISLATION THAT INCREASES 
              COMPLEXITY OF TAX RETURNS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) As part of the consideration by the Senate of tax cuts 
        for the families of America, the Senate should also examine the 
        condition of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
            (2) According to the Congressional Research Service, the 
        Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 added 1,000,000 words and 
        315 pages to the Internal Revenue Code.
            (3) The Internal Revenue Code continues to grow more 
        complex and difficult for the average taxpayer to understand, 
        and the average tax return has become more time-consuming to 
        prepare.
            (4) The average taxpayer will spend 9 hours and 54 minutes 
        preparing Form 1040 for the 1997 tax year.
            (5) The average taxpayer spends between 21 and 28 hours 
        each year on tax matters.
            (6) In 1995, 58,965,000 of the 118,218,327 tax returns that 
        were filed, almost 50 percent, were filed by taxpayers who 
        utilized the help of a paid tax preparer.
            (7) The average taxpayer spends $72 each year for tax 
        preparation.
            (8) The total burden on all taxpayers of maintaining 
        records, and preparing and filing tax returns is estimated to 
        be in excess of 1,600,000 hours per year.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
budgetary levels in this resolution assume that the Senate should give 
priority to tax proposals that simplify the tax code and reject 
proposals that add greater complexity in the tax code and increased 
compliance costs for the taxpayer.

SEC. 361. GENERAL PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF MARIJUANA FOR MEDICINAL 
              PURPOSES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this 
resolution assume that no funds appropriated by Congress should be used 
to provide, procure, furnish, fund or support, or to compel any 
individual, institution or government entity to provide, procure, 
furnish, fund or support, any item, good, benefit, program or service, 
for the purpose of the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, except 
that this section shall not apply to medical research and 
investigational new drug programs under the jurisdiction of the Food 
and Drug Administration.

SEC. 362. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AMTRAK FUNDING.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) on November 13, 1997 the Senate unanimously passed the 
        Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Public Law 105-
        134, authorizing appropriations of $1,058,000,000 for fiscal 
        year 1999; $1,023,000,000 for fiscal year 2000; $989,000,000 
        for fiscal year 2001; and $955,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, 
        totaling $4,025,000,000 for fiscal years 1999-2002;
            (2) in Public Law 105-134 the Congress declared that 
        ``intercity rail passenger service is an essential component of 
        a national intermodal passenger transportation system'';
            (3) section 201 of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act 
        of 1997 has now statutorily formalized prior Congressional 
        directives to Amtrak to reach operating self-sufficiency by 
        fiscal year 2002;
            (4) the Congress and the President, through enactment of 
        this legislation, have effectively agreed that Congress will 
        provide adequate funding to permit Amtrak to achieve the goal 
        of operating self-sufficiency;
            (5) capital investment is critical to reducing operating 
        costs and increasing the quality of Amtrak service;
            (6) capital investment is essential to improving Amtrak's 
        long-term financial health;
            (7) the $2,200,000,000 provided to Amtrak through the 
        Taxpayer Relief Act is for the sole purpose of capital 
        expenditures and other qualified expenses and is intended to 
        supplement, not supplant, annual appropriations.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
assumptions underlying the functional totals in this budget resolution 
assume that Congress and the Administration will fulfill the intent of 
the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 and appropriate 
sufficient funds in each of the next 5 fiscal years for Amtrak to 
implement its fiscal years 1998-2003 Strategic Business Plan, while 
preserving the integrity of the $2,200,000,000 provided under the 
Taxpayer Relief Act for the statutory purpose of capital investment.

SEC. 363. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) The Market Access Program (MAP) continues to be a vital 
        and important part of United States trade policy aimed at 
        maintaining and expanding United States agricultural exports, 
        countering subsidized foreign competition, strengthening farm 
        income and protecting American jobs. Further, the Senate finds 
        that:
                    (A) The Market Access Program is specifically 
                targeted towards small business, farmer cooperatives 
                and trade associations.
                    (B) The Market Access Program is administered on a 
                cost-share basis. Participants, including farmers and 
                ranchers, are required to contribute up to 50 percent 
                or more toward the cost of the program.
            (2) The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success 
        by any measure. Since the program was established, United 
        States agricultural exports have doubled. In fiscal year 1997, 
        United States agricultural exports amounted to $57,300,000,000, 
        resulting in a positive agricultural trade surplus of 
        approximately $22,000,000,000, and contributing billions of 
        dollars more in increased economic activity and additional tax 
        revenues.
            (3) The Market Access Program has also helped maintain and 
        create needed jobs throughout the Nation's economy. More than 
        one million Americans now have jobs that depend on United 
        States agricultural exports. Further, every billion dollars in 
        additional United States agricultural exports helps create as 
        many as 17,000 or more new jobs.
            (4) United States agriculture, including farm income and 
        related jobs, is more dependent than ever on maintaining and 
        expanding United States agricultural exports as Federal farm 
        programs are gradually reduced under the FAIR Act of 1996.
            (5) In addition to the Asian economic situation and 
        exchange rate fluctuations, United States agricultural exports 
        continue to be adversely impacted by continued subsidized 
        foreign competition, artificial trade barriers and other unfair 
        foreign trade practices.
            (6) The European Union (EU) and other foreign competitors 
        continue to heavily outspend the United States by more than 10 
        to 1 with regard to export subsidies.
                    (A) In 1997, the EU budgeted $7,200,000,000 for 
                export subsidies aimed at capturing a larger share of 
                the world market at the expense of United States 
                agriculture.
                    (B) EU and other foreign competitors also spend 
                nearly $500,000,000 on market promotion activities. The 
                EU spends more on wine promotion than the United States 
                currently spends on all commodities and related 
                agricultural products.
                    (C) The EU has announced a major new initiative 
                aimed at increasing their exports to Japan--
                historically, the largest single market for United 
                States agriculture exports.
            (7) United States agriculture is the most competitive 
        industry in the world, but it cannot and should not be expected 
        to compete alone against the treasuries of foreign governments.
            (8) Reducing or eliminating funding for the Market Access 
        Program would adversely affect United States agriculture's 
        ability to remain competitive in today's global marketplace. A 
        reduction in United States agricultural exports would translate 
        into lower farm income, a worsening trade deficit, slower 
        economic growth, fewer export-related jobs, and a declining tax 
        base.
            (9) United States success in upcoming trade negotiations on 
        agriculture scheduled to begin in 1999 depends on maintaining 
        an aggressive trade strategy and related policies and programs. 
        Reducing or eliminating the Market Access Program would 
        represent a form of unilateral disarmament and weaken the 
        United States negotiating position.
            (10) The Market Access Program is one of the few programs 
        specifically allowed under the current Uruguay Round Agreement.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) should be fully maintained 
as authorized and aggressively utilized by the United States Department 
of Agriculture to encourage United States agricultural exports, 
strengthen farm income, counter subsidized foreign competition, and 
protect American jobs.

SEC. 364. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF 
              HEALTH.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) heart disease was the leading cause of death for both 
        men and women in every year from 1970 to 1993;
            (2) mortality rates for individuals suffering from prostate 
        cancer, skin cancer, and kidney cancer continue to rise;
            (3) the mortality rate for African American women suffering 
        from diabetes is 134 percent higher than the mortality rate of 
        Caucasian women suffering from diabetes;
            (4) asthma rates for children increased 58 percent from 
        1982 to 1992;
            (5) nearly half of all American women between the ages of 
        65 and 75 reported having arthritis;
            (6) AIDS is the leading cause of death for Americans 
        between the ages of 24 and 44;
            (7) the Institute of Medicine has described United States 
        clinical research to be ``in a state of crisis'' and the 
        National Academy of Sciences concluded in 1994 that ``the 
        present cohort of clinical investigators is not adequate'';
            (8) biomedical research has been shown to be effective in 
        saving lives and reducing health care expenditures;
            (9) research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health 
        has contributed significantly to the first overall reduction in 
        cancer death rates since recordkeeping was instituted;
            (10) research sponsored by the National Institutes of 
        health has resulted in the identification of genetic mutations 
        for osteoporosis; Lou Gehrig's Disease, cystic fibrosis, and 
        Huntington's Disease; breast, skin and prostate cancer; and a 
        variety of other illnesses;
            (11) research sponsored by the National Institutes of 
        Health has been key to the development of Magnetic Resonance 
        Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning 
        technologies;
            (12) research sponsored by the National Institutes of 
        Health has developed effective treatments for Acute 
        Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Today, 80 percent of children 
        diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia are alive and free 
        of the disease after 5 years; and
            (13) research sponsored by the National Institutes of 
        Health contributed to the development of a new, cost-saving 
        cure for peptic ulcers.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
function totals in this budget resolution assume that--
            (1) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health 
        should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal 
        years;
            (2) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health 
        should be increased by $2,000,000,000 in year 1999 over the 
        amount appropriated in fiscal year 1998;
            (3) the budget resolution takes a major step toward meeting 
        this goal; and
            (4) at a minimum, appropriations for the National 
        Institutes of Health should match the recommendations provided 
        in the budget resolution.

SEC. 365. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DISPLAY OF TEN COMMANDMENTS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact on 
        the development of the fundamental legal principles of Western 
        Civilization; and
            (2) the Ten Commandments set forth a code of moral conduct, 
        observance of which is acknowledged to promote respect for our 
        system of laws and the good of society.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
functional totals in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume 
that--
            (1) the Ten Commandments are a declaration of fundamental 
        principles that are the cornerstones of a fair and just 
        society; and
            (2) the public display, including display in the Supreme 
        Court, the Capitol building, the White House, and other 
        government offices and courthouses across the nation, of the 
        Ten Commandments should be permitted, as long as it is 
        consistent with the establishment clause of the first amendment 
        of the United States Constitution.

            Passed the Senate April 2, 1998.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
