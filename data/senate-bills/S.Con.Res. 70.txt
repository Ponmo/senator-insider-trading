(A) extension of the child tax credit;

(3) implementing the recommendation of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly referred to as the 9/11 Commission) to adequately fund cooperative threat reduction and nuclear nonproliferation programs (securing “loose nukes”) is a high priority and should receive far greater emphasis than the President’s budget provides;
(4) readiness of our troops, particularly the National Guard and Reserve, is a high priority, and that greater emphasis needs to be placed on mitigating equipment and training shortfalls;
(5) TRICARE fees for military retirees under the age of 65 should not be increased as the President’s budget proposes;
(6) military pay and benefits should be enhanced to improve the quality of life of military personnel;
(7) improving military health care services continues to be a high priority and adequate funding to ensure quality health care for returning combat veterans should be provided;
(8) sufficient funds should be provided to the military services to expedite review of cases involving servicemembers who could have been erroneously discharged from service for a personality disorder, which resulted in a loss of benefits or care, as a result of a combat-related psychological injury (such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) or a closed head injury (such as Traumatic Brain Injury);
(9) higher priority defense needs could be addressed by funding missile defense at an adequate but lower level, not providing funding for development of space-based missile defense interceptors, and by restraining excessive cost and schedule growth in defense research, development and procurement programs;
(10) the Department of Defense should reassess current defense plans to ensure that weapons developed to counter Cold War-era threats are not redundant and are applicable to 21st century threats;
(11) sufficient resources should be provided for the Department of Defense to do an aggressive job of addressing as many as possible of the 1,260 pending recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) over the last 7 years to improve practices at the Department of Defense, including investigation of the billions of dollars of obligations, disbursements and overcharges for which the Department of Defense cannot account;
(12) savings from the actions recommended in paragraphs (9) and (11) of this section should be used to fund the priorities identified in paragraphs (3) through (8);
(13) the Department of Defense report to Congress on its assessment of cold war weapons and progress on implementing GAO recommendations as outlined in paragraphs (10) and (11) by a time determined by the appropriate authorizing committees; and
(14) the GAO report to the appropriate congressional committees by the end of the 110th Congress regarding the Department of Defense’s progress in implementing its audit recommendations.
TITLE V—SENSE OF THE SENATE AND CONGRESS
Subtitle A—Sense Of The Senate
SEC. 501. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS.
(a) Findings.—The Senate makes the following findings:
(1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and long-term care services to approximately 60,000,000 low-income children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed medical services.
(2) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and other services for the elderly and individuals living with disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other supportive services that are typically not provided by private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to maintain independence.
(3) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for about 7,500,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid program spends over $100,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare services.
(4) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than one-quarter of America's children and is the largest purchaser of maternity care, paying for more than one-third of all the births in the United States each year. Medicaid also provides critical access to care for children with disabilities, covering more than 70 percent of poor children with disabilities.
(5) More than 21,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their health care. Women comprise the majority of seniors (64 percent) on Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through Medicaid. Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State.
(6) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care for children in foster care and for health services in schools.
(7) Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all Americans. Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue for the Nation's safety net hospitals, health centers, and nursing homes, and is critical to the ability of these providers to adequately serve all Americans.
(8) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the number of Americans without health insurance, approximately 47,000,000 in 2006, is not substantially higher. The system of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in response to unmet needs, enabling Medicaid to help buffer the drop in private coverage during recessions.
(9) The Bush Administration has issued several regulations that shift Medicaid cost burdens onto States and put at risk the continued availability of much-needed services. The regulations relate to Federal payments to public providers, and for graduate medical education, rehabilitation services, school-based administration, school-based transportation, optional case management services.
(b) Sense Of The Senate.—It is the sense of the Senate that administrative regulations should not—
(1) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a critical component of the health care system of the United States;
(2) cap Federal Medicaid spending, or otherwise shift Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their taxpayers and health providers, forcing a reduction in access to essential health services for low-income elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and families; or
(3) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the health care safety net of the United States, but the entire health care system.
Subtitle B—Sense Of The Congress
SEC. 511. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON SERVICEMEMBERS’ AND VETERANS’ HEALTH CARE AND OTHER PRIORITIES.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) the Congress supports excellent health care for current and former members of the United States Armed Services—they have served well and honorably and have made significant sacrifices for this Nation;
(2) this resolution provides $48,202,000,000 in discretionary budget authority for 2009 for Function 700 (Veterans Benefits and Services), including veterans’ health care, which is $4,940,000,000 more than the 2008 level, $3,654,000,000 more than the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline level for 2009, and $3,284,000,000 more than the President’s budget for 2009; and also provides more discretionary budget authority than the President’s budget in every year after 2009;
(3) this resolution provides funding to continue addressing problems such as those identified at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to improve military and veterans’ health care facilities and services;
(4) this resolution assumes the rejection of the health care enrollment fees and pharmaceutical co-payment increases in the President’s budget;
(5) this resolution provides additional funding above the President’s inadequate budget levels for the Department of Veterans Affairs to research and treat veterans’ mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury; and
(6) this resolution provides additional funding above the President’s inadequate budget levels for the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve the speed and accuracy of its processing of disability compensation claims, including funding to hire additional personnel above the President’s requested level.
SEC. 512. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON HOMELAND SECURITY.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) this resolution assumes additional homeland security funding above the President’s requested level for 2009 and every subsequent year;
(2) this resolution assumes funding above the President’s requested level for 2009, and additional amounts in subsequent years, in the four budget functions—Function 400 (Transportation), Function 450 (Community and Regional Development), Function 550 (Health), and Function 750 (Administration of Justice)—that fund most nondefense homeland security activities; and
(3) the homeland security funding provided in this resolution will help to strengthen the security of our Nation’s transportation system, particularly our ports where significant security shortfalls still exist and foreign ports, by expanding efforts to identify and scan all high-risk United States-bound cargo, equip, train and support first responders (including enhancing interoperable communications and emergency management), strengthen border patrol, and increase the preparedness of the public health system.
SEC. 513. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING LONG-TERM FISCAL REFORM.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) both the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budget Office have warned that the Federal budget is on an unsustainable path of rising deficits and debt;
(2) using recent trend data and reasonable policy assumptions, CBO has projected that the gap between spending and revenues over the next 75 years will reach 6.9 percent of GDP;
(3) publicly held debt will rise from 36 percent today to 400 percent of GDP by the decade beginning in 2050 under CBO’s alternative policy scenario;
(4) the most significant factor affecting the long-term Federal fiscal landscape is the expectation that total public and private health spending will continue to grow faster than the economy;
(5) the Congress calls upon governmental and nongovernmental experts to develop specific options to reform the health care system and control costs, that further research and analysis on topics including comparative effectiveness, health information technology, preventative care, and provider incentives is needed, and that of critical importance is the development of a consensus on the appropriate methods for estimating the budgetary impact and health outcome effects of these proposals; and
(6) immediate policy action is needed to address the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States, including the rising costs of entitlements, in a manner that is fiscally responsible, equitable, and lasting, and that also honors commitments made to beneficiaries, and that such action should be bipartisan, bicameral, involve both legislative and executive branch participants, as well as public participation, and be conducted in a manner that ensures full, fair, and timely Congressional consideration.
SEC. 514. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) all committees should examine programs within their jurisdiction to identify wasteful and fraudulent spending;
(2) title III of this resolution includes cap adjustments to provide appropriations for agencies that control programs that accounted for a significant share of improper payments reported by Federal agencies: Social Security Administration Continuing Disability Reviews, the Medicare/Medicaid Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, and Unemployment Insurance Program Integrity;
(3) title III also includes a cap adjustment for the Internal Revenue Services for tax compliance efforts to close the $345,000,000,000 tax gap;
(4) the resolution’s deficit-neutral reserve funds require authorizing committees to cut lower priority and wasteful spending to accommodate any new high-priority entitlement benefits; and
(5) title III of the resolution directs all committees to review the performance of programs within their jurisdiction and report recommendations annually to the appropriate Committee on the Budget as part of the views and estimates process required by section 301(d) of the Congressional Budget Act.
SEC. 515. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING EXTENSION OF THE STATUTORY PAY-AS-YOU-GO RULE.
It is the sense of the Congress that to reduce the deficit, Congress should extend PAYGO consistent with provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.
SEC. 516. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON LONG-TERM BUDGETING.
It is the sense of the Congress that the determination of the congressional budget for the United States Government and the President’s budget request should include consideration of the Financial Report of the United States Government, especially its information regarding the Government’s net operating cost, financial position, and long-term liabilities.
SEC. 517. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) nearly 47 million Americans, including nine million children, lack health insurance;
(2) people without health insurance are more likely to experience problems getting medical care and to be hospitalized for avoidable health problems;
(3) most Americans receive health coverage through their employers, and a major issue facing all employers is the rising cost of health insurance;
(4) small businesses, which have generated most of the new jobs annually over the last decade, have an especially difficult time affording health coverage, because of higher administrative costs and fewer people over whom to spread the risk of catastrophic costs;
(5) because it is especially costly for small businesses to provide health coverage, their employees make up a large proportion of the Nation’s uninsured individuals; and
(6) legislation consistent with the pay-as-you-go principle should be adopted that makes health insurance more affordable and accessible, with attention to the special circumstances affecting employees of small businesses, and that lowers costs and improves the quality of health care by encouraging integration of health information technology tools into the practice of medicine, by expanding comparative effectiveness research, and by promoting improvements in disease management and disease prevention.
SEC. 518. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING PAY PARITY.
It is the sense of the Congress that rates of compensation for civilian employees of the United States should be adjusted at the same time, and in the same proportion, as are rates of compensation for members of the uniformed services.
SEC. 519. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING SUBPRIME LENDING AND FORECLOSURES.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) over the last six months, the Nation has experienced a significant increase in the number of homeowners facing the risk of foreclosure with estimates of as many as 2.8 million subprime and other distressed borrowers facing the loss of their homes over the next five years;
(2) the rise in foreclosures not only has an immediate, devastating impact on homeowners and their families, but it also has ripple effects—
(A) local communities experiencing high levels of foreclosures experience deterioration as a result of the large number of vacant foreclosed and abandoned homes;
(B) rising foreclosure rates can accelerate drops in home prices, affecting all homeowners; and
(C) home mortgage default and foreclosure rates increase risk for lenders, further restricting the availability of credit, which can in turn slow economic growth; and
(3) the rise in foreclosures is not only a crisis for subprime borrowers, but a larger problem for communities as a whole, and considering the multi-layered effects of increasing foreclosures, the Congress should consider steps to address this complex problem.
SEC. 520. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD UPON EFFORTS TO FIGHT HUNGER.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) 35.5 million Americans (12.6 million of them children) are food insecure—uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food, and that 11.1 million Americans are hungry because of lack of food;
(2) despite the critical contributions of the Department of Agriculture nutrition programs (particularly the food stamp program), which significantly reduced payment error rates while providing help to partially mitigate the effects of rising poverty and unemployment, significant need remains, even among families that receive food stamps;
(3) nearly 25 million people, including more than nine million children and nearly three million seniors, sought emergency food assistance from food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and local charities last year;
(4) additional resources are needed to ensure that nutrition assistance keeps up with inflation and rising food prices; and
(5) Department of Agriculture programs that help us fight hunger should be maintained and the Congress should continue to seize opportunities to reach Americans in need and to fight hunger.
SEC. 521. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) additional legislative action is needed to ensure that States have the necessary resources to collect all child support that is owed to families and to allow them to pass 100 percent of support on to families without financial penalty; and
(2) when 100 percent of child support payments are passed to the child, rather than administrative expenses, program integrity is improved and child support participation increases.
SEC. 522. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON THE INNOVATION AGENDA AND AMERICA COMPETES ACT.
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1) the Congress should provide sufficient funding so that our Nation may continue to be the world leader in education, innovation and economic growth;
(2) last year, Congress passed and the President signed the America COMPETES Act, bipartisan legislation designed to ensure that American students, teachers, businesses, and workers are prepared to continue leading the world in innovation, research, and technology well into the future;
(3) this resolution supports the efforts authorized in the America COMPETES Act, providing substantially increased funding above the President’s requested level for 2009, and increased amounts after 2009 in Function 250 (General Science, Space and Technology) and other functions;
(4) additional increases for scientific research and education are included in Function 270 (Energy), Function 300 (Environment and Natural Resources), Function 500 (Education, Employment, Training and Social Services), and Function 550 (Health), all of which receive more funding than the President’s budget provides;
(5) because America’s greatest resource for innovation resides within classrooms across the country, the increased funding provided in this resolution will support initiatives within the America COMPETES Act to educate tens of thousands of new scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, and place highly qualified teachers in math and science K–12 classrooms; and
(6) because independent scientific research provides the foundation for innovation and future technologies, this resolution will keep us on the path toward doubling funding for the National Science Foundation, basic research in the physical sciences, and collaborative research partnerships, and toward achieving energy independence through the development of clean and sustainable alternative energy technologies.
