                               RESOLUTION


 
       Regarding the United States response to Iraqi aggression.

Whereas the United States and its allies have vital interests in ensuring 
        regional stability in the Persian Gulf;
Whereas on August 31, 1996, Saddam Hussein, despite warnings from the United 
        States, began an unprovoked, unjustified, and brutal attack on the 
        civilian population in and around Irbil in northern Iraq, aligning 
        himself with one Kurdish faction to assault another, thereby causing the 
        deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians; and
Whereas the United States responded to Saddam Hussein's aggression on September 
        3, 1996, by destroying some of the Iraqi air defense installations and 
        announcing the expansion of the southern no-fly zone over Iraq: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate commends the military actions taken by 
and the performance of the United States Armed Forces, under the 
direction of the Commander-in-Chief, for carrying out this military 
mission in a highly professional, efficient and effective manner.
                                 <all>
