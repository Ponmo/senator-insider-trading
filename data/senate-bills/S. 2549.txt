                        fifth ship constructed in each construction 
                        yard;
                            (ii) savings that will result from the 
                        estimated reduction of the crews of destroyers 
                        by 200 or more personnel for each ship; and
                            (iii) savings that will result from a 
                        reduction in the operating costs for destroyers

        emergency.
            (2) Underutilization of the Centers of Industrial and

    ``(d)(1) Before convening a selection board to recommend Reserve 
officers for promotion, the Secretary shall establish a promotion zone 
for officers serving in each grade and competitive category to be 
considered by the board. The Secretary shall determine the number of 
officers in the promotion zone for officers serving in any grade and 
competitive category from among officers who are eligible for promotion 
in that grade and competitive category.
    ``(2) Before convening a selection board to recommend Reserve 
officers for promotion to a grade above lieutenant (junior grade), the 
Secretary shall determine the maximum number of officers in that grade 
and competitive category that the board may recommend for promotion. 
The Secretary shall make the determination under the preceding sentence 
of the maximum number that may be recommended with a view to having in 
an active status a sufficient number of Reserve officers in each grade 
and competitive category to meet the needs of the Coast Guard for 
Reserve officers in an active status. In order to make that 
determination, the Secretary shall determine (A) the number of 
positions needed to accomplish mission objectives which require 
officers of such competitive category in the grade to which the board 
will recommend officers for promotion, (B) the estimated number of 
officers needed to fill vacancies in such positions during the period 
in which it is anticipated that officers selected for promotion will be 
promoted, (C) the number of officers authorized by the Secretary to 
serve in an active status in the grade and competitive category under 
consideration, and (D) any statutory limitation on the number of 
officers in any grade or category (or combination thereof) authorized 
to be in an active status.
    ``(3)(A) The Secretary may, when the needs of the Coast Guard 
require, authorize the consideration of officers in a grade above 
lieutenant (junior grade) for promotion to the next higher grade from 
below the promotion zone.
    ``(B) When selection from below the promotion zone is authorized, 
the Secretary shall establish the number of officers that may be 
recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone in each 
competitive category to be considered. That number may not exceed the 
number equal to 10 percent of the maximum number of officers that the 
board is authorized to recommend for promotion in such competitive 
category, except that the Secretary may authorize a greater number, not 
to exceed 15 percent of the total number of officers that the board is 
authorized to recommend for promotion, if the Secretary determines that 
the needs of the Coast Guard so require. If the maximum number 
determined under this paragraph is less than one, the board may 
recommend one officer for promotion from below the promotion zone.
    ``(C) The number of officers recommended for promotion from below 
the promotion zone does not increase the maximum number of officers 
that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion under paragraph 
(2).''.

number of officers to be considered from below the zone may be 
established through the application of the running mate system under 
this subchapter or otherwise as the Secretary determines to be

the Secretary determines that it is necessary to do so in the interest 
of national security.

SEC. 565. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE COURT-MARTIAL CONVICTION OF CAPTAIN 
              CHARLES BUTLER MCVAY, COMMANDER OF THE U.S.S. 
              INDIANAPOLIS, AND ON THE COURAGEOUS SERVICE OF ITS CREW.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Shortly after midnight on the morning of July 30, 1945, 
        the United States Navy heavy cruiser U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-
        35) was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine I-58 in 
        what became the worst sea disaster in the history of the United 
        States Navy.
            (2) Although approximately 900 of the ship's crew of 1,196 
        survived the actual sinking, only 316 of those courageous 
        sailors survived when rescued after four and a half days adrift 
        in the open sea.
            (3) Nearly 600 of the approximately 900 men who survived 
        the sinking perished from battle wounds, drowning, predatory 
        shark attacks, exposure to the elements, and lack of food and 
        potable water.
            (4) Rescue came for the remaining 316 sailors when they 
        were spotted by chance by Navy Lieutenant Wilbur C. Gwinn while 
        flying a routine naval air patrol mission.
            (5) After the end of World War II, the commanding officer 
        of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, Captain Charles Butler McVay, who 
        was rescued with the other survivors, was court-martialed for 
        ``suffering a vessel to be hazarded through negligence'' by 
        failing to zigzag (a naval tactic employed to help evade 
        submarine attacks), and was convicted even though--
                    (A) the choice to zigzag was left to Captain 
                McVay's discretion in his orders; and
                    (B) Motchisura Hashimoto, the commander of the 
                Japanese submarine that sank the U.S.S. Indianapolis, 
                and Glynn R. Donaho, a United States Navy submarine 
                commander highly decorated for his service during World 
                War II, both testified at Captain McVay's court-martial 
                trial that the Japanese submarine could have sunk the 
                U.S.S. Indianapolis whether or not it had been 
                zigzagging, an assertion that the Japanese submarine 
                commander has since reaffirmed in a letter to the 
                Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the 
                Senate.
            (6) Although not argued by Captain McVay's defense counsel 
        in the court-martial trial, poor visibility on the night of the 
        sinking (as attested in surviving crew members' handwritten 
        accounts recently discovered at the National Archives) 
        justified Captain McVay's choice not to zigzag as that choice 
        was consistent with the applicable Navy directives in force in 
        1945, which stated that, ``During thick weather and at night, 
        except on very clear nights or during bright moonlight, vessels 
        normally cease zig-zagging.''.
            (7) Naval officials failed to provide Captain McVay with 
        available support that was critical to the safety of the U.S.S. 
        Indianapolis and its crew on what became its final mission by--
                    (A) disapproving a request made by Captain McVay 
                for a destroyer escort for the U.S.S. Indianapolis 
                across the Philippine Sea as being ``not necessary'';
                    (B) not informing Captain McVay that naval 
                intelligence sources, through signal intelligence (the 
                Japanese code having been broken earlier in World War 
                II), had become aware that the Japanese submarine I-58 
                was operating in the area of the U.S.S. Indianapolis' 
                course (as disclosed in evidence presented in a hearing 
                of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate); and
                    (C) not informing Captain McVay of the sinking of 
                the destroyer escort U.S.S. Underhill by a Japanese 
                submarine within range of the course of the U.S.S. 
                Indianapolis four days before the U.S.S. Indianapolis 
                departed Guam on its fatal voyage.
            (8) Captain McVay's court-martial initially was opposed by 
        his immediate command superiors, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz 
        (CINCPAC) and Vice Admiral Raymond Spruance of the 5th fleet, 
        for which the U.S.S. Indianapolis served as flagship, but, 
        despite their recommendations, Secretary of the Navy James 
        Forrestal ordered the court-martial, largely on the basis of 
        the recommendation of Admiral King, Chief of Naval Operations.
            (9) There is no explanation on the public record for 
        Secretary Forestal's overruling of the recommendations made by 
        Admirals Nimitz and Spruance.
            (10) Captain McVay was the only commander of a United 
        States Navy vessel lost in combat to enemy action during World 
        War II who was subjected to a court-martial trial for such a 
        loss, even though several hundred United States Navy ships were 
        lost in combat to enemy action during World War II.
            (11) The survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis 
        overwhelmingly conclude that McVay was not at fault and have 
        dedicated their lives to vindicating their Captain, Charles 
        McVay, but time is running out for the 130 remaining members of 
        the crew in their united and steadfast quest to clear their 
        Captain's name.
            (12) Although Captain McVay was promoted to Rear Admiral 
        upon retirement from the Navy, he never recovered from the 
        stigma of his post-war court-martial and in 1968, tragically, 
        took his own life.
            (13) Captain McVay was a graduate of the United States 
        Naval Academy, was an exemplary career naval officer with an 
        outstanding record (including participation in the amphibious 
        invasions of North Africa, the assault on Iwo Jima, and the 
        assault on Okinawa where he survived a fierce kamikaze attack), 
        was a recipient of the Silver Star earned for courage under 
        fire during the Solomon Islands campaign, and, with his crew, 
        had so thoroughly demonstrated proficiency in naval warfare 
        that the Navy entrusted Captain McVay and the crew with 
        transporting, on their fatal cruise, the components necessary 
        for assembling the atomic bombs that were exploded over 
        Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war with Japan.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) It is the sense of Congress, on the 
basis of the facts presented in a public hearing conducted by the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on September 14, 1999, 
including evidence not available at the time of Captain Charles Butler 
McVay's court-martial, and on the basis of extensive interviews and 
questioning of witnesses and knowledgeable officials and a review of 
the record of the court-martial for and in that hearing, that--
            (A) recognizing that the Secretary of the Navy remitted the 
        sentence of the court-martial and that Admiral Nimitz, as Chief 
        of Naval Operations, restored Captain McVay to active duty, the 
        American people should now recognize Captain McVay's lack of 
        culpability for the tragic loss of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and 
        the lives of the men who died as a result of her sinking; and
            (B) knowing that vital information was not available to the 
        court-martial board and that, as a result, Captain McVay was 
        convicted, Captain McVay's military record should now reflect 
        that he is exonerated for the loss of the ship and its crew.
    (2) It is, further, the sense of Congress that Congress strongly 
encourages the Secretary of the Navy to award a Navy Unit Commendation 
to the U.S.S. Indianapolis and its final crew.

                       Subtitle F--Other Matters

SEC. 1051. COMMEMORATION OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIFORM 
              CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The American military justice system predates the 
        United States itself, having had a continuous existence since 
        the enactment of the first American Articles of War by the 
        Continental Congress in 1775.
            (2) Pursuant to article I of the Constitution, which 
        explicitly empowers Congress ``To make Rules for the Government 
        and Regulation of the land and naval Forces'', Congress enacted 
        the Articles of War and an Act to Govern the Navy, which were 
        revised on several occasions between the ratification of the 
        Constitution and the end of World War II.
            (3) Dissatisfaction with the administration of military 
        justice in World War I and World War II led both to significant 
        statutory reforms in the Articles of War and to the convening 
        of a committee, under Department of Defense auspices, to draft 
        a uniform code of military justice applicable to all of the 
        Armed Forces.
            (4) The committee, chaired by Professor Edmund M. Morgan of 
        Harvard Law School, made recommendations that formed the basis 
        of bills introduced in Congress to establish such a uniform 
        code of military justice.
            (5) After lengthy hearings and debate on the congressional 
        proposals, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted 
        into law on May 5, 1950, when President Harry S. Truman signed 
        the legislation.
            (6) President Truman then issued a revised Manual for 
        Courts-Martial implementing the new code, and the code became 
        effective on May 31, 1951.
            (7) One of the greatest innovations of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice was the establishment of a civilian court of 
        appeals within the military justice system. That court, the 
        United States Court of Military Appeals (now the United States 
        Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), held its first session 
        on July 25, 1951.
            (8) Congress enacted major revisions of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice in 1968 and 1983 and, in addition, has amended 
        the code from time to time over the years as practice under the 
        code indicated a need for updating the substance or procedure 
        of the law of military justice.
            (9) The evolution of the system of military justice under 
        the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be traced in the 
        decisions of the Courts of Criminal Appeals of each of the 
        Armed Forces and the decisions of the United States Court of 
        Appeals for the Armed Forces. These courts have produced a 
        unique body of jurisprudence upon which commanders and judge 
        advocates rely in the performance of their duties.
            (10) It is altogether fitting that the fiftieth anniversary 
        of the Uniform Code of Military Justice be duly commemorated.
    (b) Commemoration.--The Congress--
            (1) requests the President to issue a proclamation 
        commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice; and
            (2) calls upon the Department of Defense, the Armed Forces, 
        and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to 
        commemorate the occasion with ceremonies and activities 
        befitting its importance.

            (3) The first nine vessels in this class bear the following 
        proud names:
                    (A) U.S.S. Nimitz (CVN-68).

                    (I) U.S.S. Ronald Reagan (CVN-76).
            (4) It is appropriate for Congress to recommend to the 
        President, as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, an 
        appropriate name for the final vessel in the ``NIMITZ'' class 
        of aircraft carriers.
            (5) Over the last 25 years the vessels in the ``NIMITZ'' 
        class of aircraft carriers have served as one of the principal 
        means of United States diplomacy and as one of the principal 
        means for the defense of the United States and our allies 
        around the world.
            (6) The name bestowed upon aircraft carrier CVN-77 should 
        embody the American spirit and provide a lasting symbol of the 
        American commitment to freedom.
            (7) The name ``Lexington' has been a symbol of freedom from 
        the first battle of the American Revolution.
            (8) The two aircraft carriers previously named U.S.S. 
        Lexington (the CV-2 and the CV-16) served our Nation for 64 
        years, served in World War II, and earned 13 battle stars.
            (9) One of those honored vessels, the CV-2, was lost after 
        having given gallant fight at the Battle of Coral Sea in 1942.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the CVN-77 
aircraft carrier should be named the ``U.S.S. Lexington''--
            (1) in order to honor the men and women who served in the 
        Armed Forces of the United States during World War II, and the 
        incalculable number of United States citizens on the home front 
        during that war, who mobilized in the name of freedom, and who 
        are today respectfully referred to as the ``Greatest 
        Generation''; and
            (2) as a special tribute to the 16,000,000 veterans of the 
        Armed Forces who served on land, sea, and air during World War 
        II (of whom less than 6,000,000 remain alive today) and a 
        lasting symbol of their commitment to freedom as they pass on 
        having proudly taken their place in history.

                                Changes

SEC. 2801. JOINT USE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.

    (a) Sense of Congress on Joint Use Projects.--It is the sense of 
Congress that in preparing the budget for a fiscal year for submission 
to Congress under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the 
Secretary of Defense should--
            (1) seek to identify military construction projects that 
        are suitable as joint use military construction projects;
            (2) specify in the budget for the fiscal year the military 
        construction projects that are identified under paragraph (1); 
        and
            (3) give priority in the budget for the fiscal year to the 
        military construction projects specified under paragraph (2).
    (b) Annual Evaluation and Report on Joint Use Projects.--(1) 
Subchapter I of chapter 169 of title 10, United States Code, is amended 
by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 2815. Joint use military construction projects: evaluation; 
              annual report
    ``(a) Annual Evaluation.--The Secretary of Defense shall include 
with the budget for each fiscal year under section 1105 of title 31, a 
certification by each Secretary concerned that in evaluating military 
construction projects for inclusion in the budget for such fiscal year, 
such Secretary evaluated the feasibility of carrying out such projects 
as joint use military construction projects.
    ``(b) Annual Report.--(1) Not later than September 30 each year, 
the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report on joint use military construction projects.
    ``(2) Each report under paragraph (1) shall include, for the one-
year period ending on the date of the report, the following:
            ``(A) The military construction requirements that were 
        evaluated for their feasibility to be carried out through joint 
        use military construction projects, with each such requirement 
        set forth by armed force, component (whether active or reserve 
        component), and location.
            ``(B) An estimate of the fiscal year in which each 
        requirement set forth under subparagraph (A) is likely to be 
        met, without regard to the applicability of any future-years 
        defense program, and an assessment of the extent to which such 
        requirement could be met more rapidly through a joint use 
        military construction project.
            ``(C) A list of the military construction projects 
        determined to be feasible as joint use military construction 
        projects, including--
                    ``(i) the number of military personnel and civilian 
                personnel to be served by each such project; and
                    ``(ii) an estimate of the costs avoidable by 
                carrying out each such project as a joint use military 
                project rather than as an independent military 
                construction project.
    ``(c) Joint Use Military Construction Project Defined.--In this 
section, the term `joint use military construction project' means a 
military construction project for a facility intended to be used by--
            ``(1) both the active and a reserve component of a single 
        armed force; or
            ``(2) two or more components (whether active or reserve 
        components) of the armed forces.''.
    (2) The table of sections at the beginning of that subchapter is 
amended by adding at the end the following new item:

``2815. Joint use military construction projects: evaluation; annual

in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall exclude from the cost 
of the improvement of the unit or units concerned the following:
            ``(A) The cost of the installation, maintenance, and repair 
        of communications, security, or antiterrorism equipment 
        required by an occupant of the unit or units to perform duties 
        assigned as a member of the armed forces.
            ``(B) The cost of repairing or replacing the exterior of 
        the unit or units if such repair or replacement is necessary to 
        meet applicable standards for historical preservation.''.

SEC. 2803. REPLACEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON SPACE BY PAY GRADE OF MILITARY

ensure that the room patterns and floor areas of military family 
housing in a particular locality (as designated by the Secretary 
concerned for purposes of this section) are similar to room patterns 
and floor areas of similar housing in the private sector in that 
locality.
    ``(b) Requests for Authority for Military Family Housing.--(1) In 
submitting to Congress a request for authority to carry out the 
construction, acquisition, or improvement of military family housing, 
the Secretary concerned shall include in the request information on the 
net floor area of each unit of military family housing to be 
constructed, acquired, or improved under the authority.
    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `net floor area', in the case of 
a military family housing unit, means the total number of square feet 
of the floor space inside the exterior walls of the unit, excluding the 
floor area of an unfinished basement, an unfinished attic, a utility 
space, a garage, a carport, an open or insect-screened porch, a 
stairwell, and any space used for a solar-energy system.''.
