TITLE II—NEXT GENERATION AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL MODERNIZATION
SEC. 201. MISSION STATEMENT; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States faces a great national challenge as the Nation’s aviation infrastructure is at a crossroads.
(2) The demand for aviation services, a critical element of the United States economy, vital in supporting the quality of life of the people of the United States, and critical in support of the Nation’s defense and national security, is growing at an ever increasing rate. At the same time, the ability of the United States air transportation system to expand and change to meet this increasing demand is limited.
(3) The aviation industry accounts for more than 10,000,000 jobs in the United States and contributes approximately $900,000,000,000 annually to the United States gross domestic product.
(4) The United States air transportation system continues to drive economic growth in the United States and will continue to be a major economic driver as air traffic triples over the next 20 years.
(5) The Next Generation Air Transportation System (in this section referred to as the “NextGen System”) is the system for achieving long-term transformation of the United States air transportation system that focuses on developing and implementing new technologies and that will set the stage for the long-term development of a scalable and more flexible air transportation system without compromising the unprecedented safety record of United States aviation.
(6) The benefits of the NextGen System, in terms of promoting economic growth and development, are enormous.
(7) The NextGen System will guide the path of the United States air transportation system in the challenging years ahead.
(b) Sense Of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) modernizing the air transportation system is a national priority and the United States must make a commitment to revitalizing this essential component of the Nation’s transportation infrastructure;
(2) one fundamental requirement for the success of the NextGen System is strong leadership and sufficient resources;
(3) the Joint Planning and Development Office of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Next Generation Air Transportation System Senior Policy Committee, each established by Congress in 2003, will lead and facilitate this important national mission to ensure that the programs and capabilities of the NextGen System are carefully integrated and aligned;
(4) Government agencies and industry must work together, carefully integrating and aligning their work to meet the needs of the NextGen System in the development of budgets, programs, planning, and research;
(5) the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration must work in cooperation and make transformational improvements to the United States air transportation infrastructure a priority; and
(6) due to the critical importance of the NextGen System to the economic and national security of the United States, partner departments and agencies must be provided with the resources required to complete the implementation of the NextGen System.
