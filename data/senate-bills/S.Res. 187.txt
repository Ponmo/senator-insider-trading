                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 24, 1999

  Mr. Daschle (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Murray) 
 submitted the following resolution; which was ordered to be placed on 
                              the calendar

                               RESOLUTION


 
    To express the sense of the Senate regarding education funding.

Whereas the American people know that a strong public education system is vital 
        to our Nation's future and they overwhelmingly support increasing the 
        Federal investment in education;
Whereas the funding level for the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human 
        Services, and Education of the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate 
        has been reduced to pay for other programs;
Whereas the current allocation for the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human 
        Services, and Education of the Committee on Appropriations is 17 percent 
        below fiscal year 1999 levels;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction in Head Start will result in 142,000 children 
        not being served;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction will cost school districts the funds for 5,246 
        newly hired teachers;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction will deprive 50,000 students of access to 
        after-school and summer school programs;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction in funding for the Individuals with 
        Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will make it far more difficult for 
        States to provide an appropriate education for students with 
        disabilities by reducing funding by more than $880,000,000;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction will deprive 2,100,000 children in high-poverty 
        communities of educational services to help them do well in school and 
        master the basics;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction will result in 1,000 fewer school districts 
        receiving support for their initiatives to integrate technology into 
        their classrooms;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction will deny nearly 200,000 disadvantaged and 
        middle-income students access to counseling and educational support to 
        help them succeed in college;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction will reduce funds provided to schools to 
        improve school safety by nearly $100,000,000;
Whereas the 17 percent reduction will cause 100,000 students to lose their 
        Federal Pell Grant awards;
Whereas no action has been taken in the Senate on the Departments of Labor, 
        Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies 
        Appropriations Act, 2000; and
Whereas there are only 4 legislative work days left before the end of fiscal 
        year 2000: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Senate should increase the Federal investment in 
        education, including providing--
                    (A) $1,400,000,000 for the second year of the 
                initiative to reduce class sizes in early grades by 
                hiring 100,000 qualified teachers;
                    (B) an increase in support for programs that 
                recruit, train, and provide professional development 
                for, teachers;
                    (C) $600,000,000 for after-school programs, thereby 
                tripling the current investment;
                    (D) an increase, not a decrease, in funding for the 
                Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994;
                    (E) an increase in funding for part A of title I of 
                the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for 
                children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and an 
                increase in funding for reading and literacy grants 
                under part C of title II of such Act;
                    (F) an increase, not a decrease, in funding for the 
                Individuals with Disabilities Education Act;
                    (G) funding for a larger maximum Federal Pell Grant 
                award for college students, and an increase in funding 
                for mentoring and other need-based programs;
                    (H) an increase, not a decrease, in funds available 
                to help schools use technology effectively in the 
                classroom and narrow the technology gap; and
                    (I) at least $3,700,000,000 in Federal resources to 
                help communities leverage funds to modernize public 
                school facilities; and
            (2) the Senate should stay within the discretionary 
        spending caps and avoid using the resources of the social 
        security program by finding discretionary spending offsets that 
        do not jeopardize important investments in other key programs 
        within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health 
        and Human Services, and Education of the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the Senate.
