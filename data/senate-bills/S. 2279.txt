                 TITLE VII--NATIONAL PARKS OVERFLIGHTS

SEC. 701. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Federal Aviation Administration has sole authority 
        to control airspace over the United States;
            (2) the Federal Aviation Administration has the authority 
        to preserve, protect, and enhance the environment by 
        minimizing, mitigating, or preventing the adverse effects of 
        aircraft overflights on the public and tribal lands;
            (3) the National Park Service has the responsibility of 
        conserving the scenery and natural and historic objects and 
        wildlife in national parks and of providing for the enjoyment 
        of the national parks in ways that leave the national parks 
        unimpaired for future generations;
            (4) the protection of tribal lands from aircraft 
        overflights is consistent with protecting the public health and 
        welfare and is essential to the maintenance of the natural and 
        cultural resources of Indian tribes;
            (5) the National Parks Overflights Working Group, composed 
        of general aviation, air tour, environmental, and Native

                    ``(B) in accordance with conditions and limitations 
                prescribed for that operator by the Administrator; and

                management plan for that park or those tribal lands.
            ``(2) Application for operating authority.--
                    ``(A) Application required.--Before commencing 
                commercial air tour operations over a national park or 
                tribal lands, a commercial air tour operator shall 
                apply to the Administrator for authority to conduct the 
                operations over that park or those tribal lands.
                    ``(B) Competitive bidding for limited capacity 
                parks.--Whenever a commercial air tour management plan 
                limits the number of commercial air tour flights over a 
                national park area during a specified time frame, the 
                Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall 
                authorize commercial air tour operators to provide such 
                service. The authorization shall specify such terms and 
                conditions as the Administrator and the Director find 
                necessary for management of commercial air tour 
                operations over the national park. The Administrator, 
                in cooperation with the Director, shall develop an open 
                competitive process for evaluating proposals from 
                persons interested in providing commercial air tour 
                services over the national park. In making a selection 
                from among various proposals submitted, the 
                Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall 
                consider relevant factors, including--
                            ``(i) the safety record of the company or 
                        pilots;

                            ``(vi) responsiveness to any criteria 
                        developed by the National Park Service or the 
                        affected national park.
                    ``(C) Number of operations authorized.--In 
                determining the number of authorizations to issue to 
                provide commercial air tour service over a national 
                park, the Administrator, in cooperation with the 
                Director, shall take into consideration the provisions 
                of the air tour management plan, the number of existing 
                commercial air tour operators and current level of 
                service and equipment provided by any such 
companies, and the financial viability of each commercial air tour 
operation.

        air tour operators may conduct commercial air tour operations 
        over a national park under part 91 of the Federal Aviation 
        Regulations (14 CFR 91.1 et seq.) if--
                    ``(A) such activity is permitted under part 119 (14 
                CFR 119.1(e)(2));

        Notwithstanding subsection (c), an existing commercial air tour 
        operator shall, not later than 90 days after the date of 
        enactment of the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation 
        System Improvement Act of 1998, apply for operating authority 
        under part 119, 121, or 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations 
        (14 CFR Pt. 119, 121, or 135). A new entrant commercial air 
        tour operator shall apply for such authority before conducting 
        commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal 
        lands.

                a person applies for authority to operate a commercial 
                air tour over the park. The development of the air tour 
                management plan is to be a cooperative undertaking 
                between the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
                National Park Service. The air tour management plan 
                shall be developed by means of a public process, and 
                the agencies shall develop information and analysis 
                that explains the conclusions that the agencies make in 
                the application of the respective criteria. Such 
                explanations shall be included in the Record of 
                Decision and may be subject to judicial review.
                    ``(B) Objective.--The objective of any air tour 
                management plan shall be to develop acceptable and

                significant adverse impacts, if any, of commercial air 
                tours upon the natural and cultural resources and 
                visitor experiences and tribal lands.

        tour management plan under this subsection, the Administrator

        document required by section 102 of the National Environmental 
        Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) which may include a finding 
        of no significant impact, an environmental assessment, or an 
        environmental impact statement, and the Record of Decision for 
        the air tour management plan.
