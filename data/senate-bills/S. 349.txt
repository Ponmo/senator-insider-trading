                               AMENDMENT
                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        March 24, 1994.
      Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 349) entitled ``An 
Act to provide for the disclosure of lobbying activities to influence 
the Federal Government, and for other purposes'', do pass with the 
following

                               AMENDMENT:

        Strike out all after the enacting clause, and insert:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1994''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) responsible representative Government requires public 
        awareness of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence the 
        public decision making process in both the legislative and 
        executive branches of the Federal Government;
            (2) existing lobbying disclosure statutes have been 
        ineffective because of unclear statutory language, weak 
        administrative and enforcement provisions, and an absence of 
        clear guidance as to who is required to register and what they 
        are required to disclose; and
            (3) the effective public disclosure of the identity and 
        extent of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence Federal 
        officials in the conduct of Government actions will increase 
        public confidence in the integrity of Government.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    As used in this Act:
            (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code.
            (2) Client.--The term ``client'' means any person or entity 
        (including a State or local government) who employs or retains 
        another person for financial or other compensation to conduct 
        lobbying activities on behalf of that person or entity or 
        another person or entity. An organization whose employees act 
        as lobbyists on its own behalf is both a client and an employer 
        of such employees. In the case of any person or entity that 
        employs or retains a lobbyist to conduct lobbying activities on 
        behalf of another person or entity, the client is both the 
        person or entity that employs or retains the lobbyist and the 
        person or entity on whose behalf the lobbyist conducts lobbying 
        activities. In the case of a coalition or association that 
        employs or retains other persons to conduct lobbying 
        activities, the client is--
                    (A) the coalition or association and not its 
                individual members when the lobbying activities are 
                conducted on behalf of its membership and financed by 
                the coalition's or association's dues and assessments, 
                or
                    (B) the individual member or members, when the 
                lobbying activities are, directly or indirectly, 
                financed separately by one or more individual members 
                and not by the coalition's or association's dues and 
                assessments.
            (3) Covered executive branch official.--The term ``covered 
        executive branch official'' means--
                    (A) the President or the President-elect;
                    (B) the Vice President or the Vice President-elect;
                    (C) any officer or employee (other than a clerical 
                or secretarial employee) of the Executive Office of the 
                President or any individual functioning in the capacity 
                of such an officer or employee on an unpaid basis;

                (a)(2) of title 5, United States Code;
                    (F) any member of the uniformed services whose pay 
                grade is at or above O-7 under section 201 of title 37, 
                United States Code; and
                    (G) any officer or employee serving in a position 
                of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, 
                or policy-advocating character described in section 
                7511(b)(2) of title 5, United States Code, including an

                at the same time gave the same or similar item to other 
                covered persons or entities.
            (B) The giving of an item shall not be considered to be 
        motivated by a family relationship or personal friendship if 
        the family member or friend seeks--
                    (i) to deduct the value of such item as a business 
                expense on the family member's or friend's Federal 
                income tax return, or

                client) by a lobbyist or an agent of a foreign 
                principal (as defined in section 1(c) of the Foreign 
                Agents Registration Act) and not paid for either

House of Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following: 
``A Member, officer, or employee of the House of Representatives shall 
not accept a gift given by a lobbyist or registrant subject to the 
Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1994 in knowing violation of that Act.''.

SEC. 8. INITIAL PROCEDURE FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS.

    (a) Allegation of a Violation.--Whenever the Office of Lobbying 
Registration and Public Disclosure has reason to believe that a person 
may be in violation of the requirements of this Act, the Director shall 
notify the person in writing of the nature of the alleged violation and 
provide an opportunity for the person to respond in writing to the 
allegation within 30 days after the notification is sent or such longer 
period as the Director may determine appropriate in the circumstances.
    (b) Initial Determination.--If the person responds within the 
period described in the notification under subsection (a), the Director 
shall--
            (1) issue a written determination that the person has not 
        violated this Act if the person provides adequate information 
        or explanation to make such determination; or
             (2) make a formal request for information under subsection 
        (c) or a determination under section 9, if the information or 
        explanation provided indicates that such person may have 
        violated this Act.
A determination under paragraph (1) may be published by the Director 
with the names redacted if the Director determines the determination 
without the names provides useful guidance.
    (c) Formal Request for Information.--If a person fails to respond 
in writing within the period described in the notification under 
subsection (a) or the response is not adequate to determine whether 
such person has violated this Act, the Director may make a formal 
request for specific additional written information (subject to 
applicable privileges) that is reasonably necessary for the Director to 
make such determination. Each such request shall be structured to 
minimize any burden imposed, consistent with the need to determine 
whether the person is in compliance with this Act, and shall--
            (1) state the nature of the conduct constituting the 
        alleged violation which is the basis for the inquiry and the 
        provision of law applicable thereto;
            (2) describe the class or classes of material to be 
        produced pursuant to the request with such definiteness and 
        certainty as to permit such material to be readily identified; 
        and
            (3) prescribe a return date or dates which provide a 
        reasonable period of time within which the person may assemble 
        and make available for inspection and copying or reproduction 
        the material so requested.
    (d) Nondisclosure of Information.--Information provided to the 
Director under this section and sections 9 and 10 shall not be made 
available to the public without the consent of the person providing the 
information, except to the extent such information may be included in--
            (1) any new or amended registration or report filed in 
        connection with an inquiry under this section; or
            (2) a written decision issued by the Director under section 
        9 or 10 after appropriate redaction by the Director to protect 
        the interests of innocent parties.

SEC. 9. DETERMINATIONS OF VIOLATIONS.

    (a) Notification and Hearing.--If the information provided to the 
Director under section 8 indicates that a person may have violated this 
Act, the Director shall--
            (1) notify the person in writing of this finding and, if 
        appropriate, a proposed penalty assessment and provide such 
        person with an opportunity to respond in writing within 30 days 
        after the notice is sent; and
            (2) if requested in writing by that person within that 30-
        day period, afford the person an opportunity for a hearing on 
        the record under the provisions of section 554 of title 5, 
        United States Code.
    (b) Determination.--Upon the receipt of a written response under 
subsection (a)(1) when no hearing under subsection (a)(2) is requested, 
upon the completion of a hearing requested under subsection (a)(2), or 
upon the expiration of 30 days in a case in which no such written 
response is received, the Director shall review the information 
received under this section (including evidence presented at any such 
hearing) and section 8 and make a final determination whether there was 
a violation and a final determination of the penalty, if any. If no 
written response was received under this section within the 30-day 
period provided, the determination and penalty assessment shall 
constitute a final order not subject to appeal.
    (c) Written Decision.--
            (1) Determination of violation.--If the Director makes a 
        final determination under subsection (b) that there was a 
        violation, the Director shall issue a public written decision--
                    (A) directing the person to correct the violation; 
                and
                    (B) assessing a civil monetary penalty in an amount 
                determined as follows:
                            (i) In the case of a minor violation, the 
                        amount shall be no more than $10,000, depending 
                        on the nature and extent of the violation.
                            (ii) In the case of a significant 
                        violation, the amount shall be more than 
                        $10,000, but no more than $200,000, depending 
                        on the nature and extent of the violation and 
                        the extent to which the person may have 
                        profited from the violation.
            (2) Determination of no violation or insufficient 
        Evidence.--If the Director determines that no violation 
        occurred or there was not sufficient evidence that a violation 
        occurred, the Director shall issue a written notice of such 
        determination to the person charged. Such notice may be 
        published by the Director with names redacted if the Director 
        determines it provides useful guidance.
    (d) Civil Injunctive Relief.--If a person fails to comply with a 
directive to correct a violation under subsection (c), the Director 
shall refer the case to the Attorney General to seek civil injunctive 
relief in the appropriate court of the United States to compel such 
person to comply with such directive.
    (e) Penalty Assessments.--
            (1) General rule.--No penalty shall be assessed under this 
        section unless the Director finds that the person subject to 
        the penalty knew or should have known that such person was in 
        violation of this Act. In determining the amount of a penalty 
        to be assessed, the Director shall take into account the 
        totality of the circumstances, including the extent and gravity 
        of the violation and such other matters as justice may require.
            (2) Regulations.--Regulations prescribed by the Director 
        under section 7 shall define minor and significant violations. 
        Significant violations shall be defined to include a failure to 
        register and any other violation that is extensive or repeated 
        if the person who commits such violation knew or should have 
        known that the action constituting the violation was a 
        violation of this Act.
    (f) Limitation.--No proceeding shall be initiated under this 
section relating to a registration or report filed or required to be 
filed under this Act unless the Director notifies the person who is to 
be the subject to the proceeding of the alleged violation within 3 
years after the date on which such registration or report was filed or 
was required to be filed.

SEC. 10. OTHER VIOLATIONS.

    (a) Late Registration or Filing; Failure To Provide Information.--
If a person registers or files a report after a registration or filing 
is required under this Act, or fails to provide information requested 
by the Director under section 8(c), the Director shall--
            (1) notify the person in writing of the violation and a 
        proposed penalty assessment and provide such person with an 
        opportunity to respond in writing within 30 days after the 
        notice is sent; and
            (2) if requested by that person within that 30-day period, 
        afford the person a hearing in accordance with section 9(a)(2).
    (b) Determination.--Upon the receipt of a written response under 
subsection (a)(1) when no hearing under subsection (a)(2) is requested, 
upon the completion of a hearing requested under subsection (a)(2), or 
upon the expiration of 30 days in a case in which no such written 
response is received, the Director shall review the information 
received under subsection (a) (including evidence presented at any such 
hearing) and, unless the Director determines, on the basis of such 
information, that the late filing or failure to provide information was 
justified, the Director shall make a final determination of a violation 
and a final determination of the penalty, if any. If no written 
response or request for a hearing was received under subsection (a) 
within the 30-day period provided, the determination and penalty 
assessment shall constitute a final order not subject to appeal.
    (c) Written Decision.--
            (1) Determination of violation.--If the Director makes a 
        final determination under subsection (b) that there was a 
        violation, the Director shall issue a public written decision--
                    (A) in the case of a late registration or filing, 
                assessing a civil monetary penalty of $200 for each 
                week by which the filing was late, with the total 
                penalty not to exceed $10,000; or
                    (B) in the case of a failure to provide 
                information--
                            (i) directing the person to provide the 
                        information within a reasonable period of time; 
                        and
                            (ii) except where the Director determines 
                        that the violation was the result of a good 
                        faith dispute over the validity or appropriate 
                        scope of a request for information, assessing a 
                        civil monetary penalty in an amount not to 
                        exceed $10,000.
            (2) Determination of no violation or insufficient 
        evidence.--If the Director determines that no violation 
        occurred or there was not sufficient evidence that a violation 
        occurred, the Director shall issue a written notice of such 
        determination to the person charged. Such notice may be 
        published by the Director with names redacted if the Director 
        determines it provides useful guidance.
    (d) Civil Injunctive Relief.--In the case of a person failing to 
comply with a directive issued under subsection (c)(2)(A), the Director 
shall refer such matter to the Attorney General, who shall seek civil 
injunctive relief in the appropriate court of the United States to 
compel such person to comply with such directive unless the Attorney 
General finds no reasonable likelihood that the Government would 
prevail.

SEC. 11. JUDICIAL REVIEW.

    (a) Final Decision.--A written decision issued by the Director 
under section 9 or 10 shall become final 60 days after the date on 
which the Director provides notice of the decision, unless such 
decision is appealed under subsection (b) of this section.
    (b) Appeal.--Any person adversely affected by a written decision 
issued by the Director under section 9 or 10 may appeal such decision, 
except as provided under section 9(b) or 10(b), to the appropriate 
United States court of appeals. Such review may be obtained by filing a 
written notice of appeal in such court no later than 60 days after the 
date on which the Director provides notice of the Director's decision 
and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice of appeal to the 
Director. The Director shall file in such court the record upon which 
the decision was issued, as provided under section 2112 of title 28, 
United States Code. The findings of fact of the Director shall be 
conclusive, unless found to be unsupported by substantial evidence, as 
provided under section 706(2)(E) of title 5, United States Code. Any 
penalty assessed or other action taken in the decision shall be stayed 
during the pendency of the appeal.
    (c) Recovery of Penalty.--Any penalty assessed in a written 
decision which has become final under this Act may be recovered in a 
civil action brought by the Attorney General in an appropriate United 
States district court. In any such action, no matter that was raised or 
that could have been raised before the Director or pursuant to judicial 
review under subsection (b) may be raised as a defense, and the 
determination of liability and the determination of amounts of 
penalties and assessments shall not be subject to review.

SEC. 12. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.
