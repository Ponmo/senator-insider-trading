        need to accommodate new sensors and weapons in future surface 
        combatants to counter the future threats referred to in 
        paragraph (4) when compared with the cost and schedule arising 
        from the need to accommodate sensors and weapons on surface 
        combatants as contemplated by the 2009 shipbuilding plan for 
        the vessels concerned.
            (6) A verification by the commanders of the combatant 
        commands that the shipbuilding program for the vessels 
        concerned would be preferable to the surface combatants 
        included in the 2009 shipbuilding plan for the vessels 
        concerned in meeting all of their future mission requirements.
            (7) A joint review by the Navy and the Missile Defense 
        Agency setting forth additional requirements for investment in 
        Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) beyond the number of DDG-
        51 and CG-47 vessels planned to be equipped for this mission 
        area in the budget of the President for fiscal year 2010 (as

SEC. 124. NEXT GENERATION BOMBER AIRCRAFT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Long-range strike is a critical mission in which the 
        United States needs to retain a credible and dominant 
        capability.
            (2) Long range, penetrating strike systems provide--
                    (A) a hedge against being unable to obtain access 
                to forward bases for political reasons;
                    (B) a capacity to respond quickly to contingencies;
                    (C) the ability to base outside the reach of 
                emerging adversary anti-access and area-denial 
                capabilities; and
                    (D) the ability to impose disproportionate 
                defensive costs on prospective adversaries of the 
                United States.
            (3) The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review found that there 
        was a requirement for a next generation bomber aircraft and 
        directed the United States Air Force to ``develop a new land-
        based, penetrating long range strike capability to be fielded 
        by 2018''.
            (4) On April 6, 2009, Secretary Gates announced that the 
        United States ``will not pursue a development program for a 
        follow-on Air Force bomber until we have a better understanding 
        of the need, the requirement and the technology''.
            (5) On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama announced the 
        termination of the next generation bomber aircraft program in 
        the document of the Office of Management and Budget entitled 
        ``Terminations, Reductions, and Savings'', stating that ``there 
        is no urgent need to begin an expensive development program for 
        a new bomber'' and that ``the future bomber fleet may not be 
        affordable over the next six years''.
            (6) The United States will need a new long-range strike 
        capability because the conflicts of the future will likely 
        feature heavily defended airspace, due in large part to the 
        proliferation of relatively inexpensive, but sophisticated and 
        deadly, air defense systems.
            (7) General Michael Maples, the Director of the Defense 
        Intelligence Agency, noted during a March 10, 2009, hearing of 
        the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on worldwide 
        threats that ``Russia, quite frankly, is the developer of most 
        of those [advanced air defense] systems and is exporting those 
        systems both to China and to other countries in the world''.
            (8) The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the 
        Strategic Posture of the United States, submitted to Congress 
        on May 6, 2009, states that ``[t]he bomber force is valuable 
        particularly for extending deterrence in time of crisis, as 
        their deployment is visible and signals U.S. commitment. 
        Bombers also impose a significant cost burden on potential 
        adversaries in terms of the need to invest in advanced air 
        defenses''.
            (9) The commanders of the United States Pacific Command, 
        the United States Strategic Command, and the United States 
        Joint Forces Command have each testified before the Committee 
        on Armed Services of the Senate in support of the capability 
        that the next generation bomber aircraft would provide.
            (10) On June 17, 2009, General James Cartwright, Vice-
        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and chair of the Joint 
        Requirements Oversight Council, stated during a hearing before 
        the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that ``the nation 
        needs a new bomber''.
            (11) Nearly half of the United States bomber aircraft 
        inventory (47 percent) pre-dates the Cuban Missile Crisis.
            (12) The only air-breathing strike platforms the United 
        States possesses today with reach and survivability to have a 
        chance of successfully executing missions more than 1,000 
        nautical miles into enemy territory from the last air-to-air 
        refueling are 16 combat ready B-2 bomber aircraft.
            (13) The B-2 bomber aircraft was designed in the 1980s and 
        achieved initial operational capability over a decade ago.
            (14) The crash of an operational B-2 bomber aircraft during 
        takeoff at Guam in early 2008 indicates that attrition can and 
        does occur even in peacetime.
            (15) The primary mission requirement of the next generation 
        bomber aircraft is the ability to strike targets anywhere on 
        the globe with whatever weapons the contingency requires.
            (16) The requisite aerodynamic, structural, and low-
        observable technologies to develop the next generation bomber 
        aircraft already exist in fifth-generation fighter aircraft.
    (b) Policy on Continued Development of Next Generation Bomber 
Aircraft in Fiscal Year 2010.--It is the policy of the United States to 
support a development program for next generation bomber aircraft 
technologies.

SEC. 243. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN FOR THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE 
              ELEMENT OF THE BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element of the 
        Ballistic Missile Defense System should be an operationally 
        effective, cost-effective, affordable, reliable, suitable, and 
        survivable system capable of defending the United States from 
        the threat of long-range missile attacks from nations such as 
        North Korea and Iran, and adequate resources should be 
        available to create and maintain such a capability (including 
        continuing effectiveness over the course of its service life);
            (2) the force structure and inventory levels of the Ground-
        based Midcourse Defense element should be determined based on 
        an assessment of ballistic missile threats from nations such as 
        North Korea and Iran and a determination by senior military 
        leaders, combatant commanders, and defense officials of the 
        requirements and capabilities needed to address those threats; 
        and
            (3) the test and evaluation program for the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense element should be rigorous, robust, 
        operationally realistic, and capable of providing a high degree 
        of confidence in the capability of the system (including 
        testing to demonstrate the continuing effectiveness of the 
        system over the course of its service life), and adequate 
        resources should be available for that test and evaluation 
        program (including interceptor missiles and targets for flight 
        tests).

SEC. 246. SENSE OF SENATE ON AND RESERVATION OF FUNDS FOR DEVELOPMENT 
              AND DEPLOYMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS IN EUROPE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        Bucharest Summit Declaration of April 3, 2008, the Heads of 
        State and Government participating in the meeting of the North 
        Atlantic Council declared that ``[b]allistic missile 
        proliferation poses an increasing threat to Allies' forces, 
        territory and populations. Missile defence forms part of a 
        broader response to counter this threat. We therefore recognize 
        the substantial contribution to the protection of Allies from 
        long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by the planned 
        deployment of European-based United States missile defence 
        assets''.
            (2) The Bucharest Summit Declaration also stated that 
        ``[b]earing in mind the principle of the indivisibility of 
        Allied security as well as NATO solidarity, we task the Council 
        in Permanent Session to develop options for a comprehensive 
        missile defence architecture to extend coverage to all Allied 
        territory and populations not otherwise covered by the United 
        States system for review at our 2009 Summit, to inform any 
        future political decision''.
            (3) In the Bucharest Summit Declaration, the North Atlantic 
        Council also reaffirmed to Russia that ``current, as well as 
        any future, NATO Missile Defence efforts are intended to better 
        address the security challenges we all face, and reiterate 
        that, far from posing a threat to our relationship, they offer 
        opportunities to deepen levels of cooperation and stability''.
            (4) In the Strasbourg/Kehl Summit Declaration of April 4, 
        2009, the heads of state and government participating in the 
        meeting of the North Atlantic Council reaffirmed ``the 
        conclusions of the Bucharest Summit about missile defense,'' 
        and declared that ``we judge that missile threats should be 
        addressed in a prioritized manner that includes consideration 
        of the level of imminence of the threat and the level of 
        acceptable risk''.
            (5) Iran is rapidly developing its ballistic missile 
        capabilities, including its inventory of short-range and 
        medium-range ballistic missiles that can strike portions of 
        Eastern and Southern North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        European territory, as well as the pursuit of long-range 
        ballistic missiles that could reach Europe or the United 
        States.
            (6) On July 8, 2008, the Government of the United States 
        and the Government of the Czech Republic signed an agreement to 
        base a radar facility in the Czech Republic that is part of a 
        proposed missile defense system to protect Europe and the 
        United States against a potential future Iranian long-range 
        ballistic missile threat.
            (7) On August 20, 2008, the United States and the Republic 
        of Poland signed an agreement concerning the deployment of 
        ground-based ballistic missile defense interceptors in the 
        territory of the Republic of Poland.
            (8) Section 233 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417; 122 
        Stat. 4393; 10 U.S.C. 2431 note) establishes conditions for the 
        availability of funds for procurement, construction, and 
        deployment of the planned missile defense system in Europe, 
        including that the host nations must ratify any missile defense 
        agreements with the United States and that the Secretary of 
        Defense must certify that the system has demonstrated the 
        ability to accomplish the mission.
            (9) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama, speaking in 
        Prague, Czech Republic, stated, ``As long as the threat from 
        Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system 
        that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian threat is 
        eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for security, and the 
        driving force for missile defense construction in Europe will 
        be removed.''.
            (10) On June 16, 2009, Deputy Secretary of Defense William 
        Lynn testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        Senate that the United States Government is reviewing its 
        options for developing and deploying operationally effective, 
        cost-effective missile defense capabilities to Europe against 
        potential future Iranian missile threats, in addition to the 
        proposed deployment of a missile defense system in Poland and 
        the Czech Republic.
            (11) On July 9, 2009, General James Cartwright, the Vice 
        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that the Department 
        of Defense was considering some 40 different missile defense 
        architecture options for Europe that could provide a ``regional 
        defense capability to protect the nations'' of Europe, and a 
        ``redundant capability that would assist in protecting the 
        United States,'' and that the Department was considering ``what 
        kind of an architecture best suits the defense of the region, 
        the defense of the homeland, and the regional stability''.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States Government should continue developing 
        and planning for the proposed deployment of elements of a 
        Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, including a 
        midcourse radar in the Czech Republic and Ground-Based 
        Interceptors in Poland, consistent with section 233 of the 
        Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
        Year 2009;
            (2) in conjunction with the continued development of the 
        planned Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, the United 
        States should work with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        allies to explore a range of options and architectures to 
        provide missile defenses for Europe and the United States 
        against current and future Iranian ballistic missile 
        capabilities;
            (3) any alternative system that the United States 
        Government considers deploying in Europe to provide for the 
        defense of Europe and a redundant defense of the United States 
        against future long-range Iranian missile threats should be at 
        least as capable and cost-effective as the proposed European 
        deployment of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system; and
            (4) any missile defense capabilities deployed in Europe 
        should, to the extent practical, be interoperable with United 
        States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense 
        systems.
    (c) Reservation of Funds for Missile Defense Systems.--
            (1) In general.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated 
        or otherwise made available for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 for 
        the Missile Defense Agency for the purpose of developing 
        missile defenses in Europe, $353,100,000 shall be available 
        only for the purposes described in paragraph (2).
            (2) Use of funds.--The purposes described in this paragraph 
        are the following:
                    (A) Research, development, test, and evaluation 
                of--
                            (i) the proposed midcourse radar element of 
                        the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system in 
                        the Czech Republic; and
                            (ii) the proposed long-range missile 
                        defense interceptor site element of such 
                        defense system in Poland.
                    (B) Research, development, test, and evaluation, 
                procurement, construction, or deployment of other 
                missile defense systems designed to protect Europe, and 
                the United States in the case of long-range missile 
                threats, from the threats posed by current and future 
                Iranian ballistic missiles of all ranges, if the 
                Secretary of Defense submits to the congressional 
                defense committees a report certifying that such 
                systems are expected to be--
                            (i) consistent with the direction from the 
                        North Atlantic Council to address ballistic

SEC. 333. ALTERNATIVE AVIATION FUEL INITIATIVE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Dependence on foreign sources of oil is detrimental to 
        the national security of the United States due to possible 
        disruptions in supply.
            (2) The Department of Defense is the largest single 
        consumer of fuel in the United States.
            (3) The United States Air Force is the largest consumer of 
        fuel in the Department of Defense.
            (4) The dramatically fluctuating price of fuel can have a 
        significant budgetary impact on the Department of Defense.
            (5) The United States Air Force uses about 2,600,000,000 
        gallons of jet fuel a year, or 10 percent of the entire 
        domestic market in aviation fuel.
            (6) The Air Force's Alternative Aviation Fuel Initiative 
        includes certification and testing of both biomass-derived 
        (``biofuel'') and synthetic fuel blends produced via the 
        Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. By not later than December 31, 
        2016, the Air Force will be prepared to cost competitively 
        acquire 50 percent of the Air Force's domestic aviation fuel 
        requirement via an alternative fuel blend in which the 
        alternative component is derived from domestic sources produced 
        in a manner that is greener than fuels produced from 
        conventional petroleum.
            (7) The Air Force Energy Program will provide options to 
        reduce the use of foreign oil, by focusing on expanding 
        alternative energy options that provide favorable environmental 
        attributes as compared to currently-available options.
    (b) Continuation of Initiatives.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Air Force shall 
        continue the alternative aviation fuel initiatives of the Air 
        Force with a goal of--

                and support equipment, and associated storage and 
                distribution infrastructure for unrestricted 
                operational use of a synthetic fuel blend by early 
                2011;
                    (B) being prepared to acquire 50 percent of its 
                domestic aviation fuel requirement from alternative or 
                synthetic fuels (including blends of alternative or 
                synthetic fuels with conventional fuels) by not later 
                than December 31, 2016, provided that--
                            (i) the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 
                        associated with the production and combustion 
                        of such fuel shall be equal to or lower than 
                        such emissions from conventional fuels that are 
                        used in the same application, as determined in 
                        accordance with guidance by the Department of 
                        Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency; 
                        and
                            (ii) prices for such fuels are cost 
                        competitive with petroleum-based alternatives 
                        that are used for the same functions;
                    (C) taking actions in collaboration with the 
                commercial aviation industry and equipment 
                manufacturers to spur the development of a domestic

SEC. 536. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE INTERSTATE COMPACT ON EDUCATIONAL 
              OPPORTUNITY FOR MILITARY CHILDREN.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The incongruity in how States assess and enroll 
        transfer students creates challenges for the moving military 
        family and can, in some cases, be detrimental to the higher 
        education opportunities of military children.
            (2) The inability to transfer credits, maintain the proper 
        number of school-year hours, missing exams, and other obstacles 
        can make moving as a military family difficult.
            (3) The average military child moves six to nine times 
        between kindergarten and high school graduation, creating a 
        variety of challenges and obstacles related to permanent change 
        of station moves.
            (4) The demands and strains on members of the Armed Forces 
        and their families continue to increase and will do so for the 
        foreseeable future as the United States continues overseas 
        contingency operations, and children and adolescents are 
        acutely vulnerable to family stresses caused by the high 
        operational tempo and may therefore be at a heightened risk for 
        emotional distress.
            (5) The routine of the school environment can be a source 
        of stability for military children as they cope with the 
        disruptive challenges caused by the deployment of a parent or a 
        relocation.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to--
            (1) express strong support and commendation for Alabama, 
        Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, 
        Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, 
        Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, 
        Virginia, and Washington as States that have successfully 
        enacted the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for 
        Military Children;
            (2) express its strong support and encourage all remaining 
        States to enact the Interstate Compact on Educational 
        Opportunity for Military Children;
            (3) recognize the importance of the components of the 
        Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military 
        Children, including--

SEC. 556. SENSE OF SENATE ON PREPARATION AND COORDINATION OF FAMILY 
              CARE PLANS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Family Care Plans provide a military tool to document 
        the plan by which members of the Armed Forces provide for the 
        care of their family members when military duties prevent 
        members of the Armed Forces from doing so themselves. Properly 
        prepared Family Care Plans are essential to military readiness. 
        Minimizing the strain on members of the Armed Forces of 
        unresolved, challenged, or voided child custody arrangements 
        arising during deployments or temporary duty directly 
        contributes to the national defense by enabling members of the 
        Armed Forces to devote their entire energy to their military 
        mission and duties.
            (2) When Family Care Plans are properly prepared and 
        coordinated with all affected parties, the legal difficulties 
        that may otherwise arise in the absence of the military 
        custodial parent often can be minimized, if not eliminated.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the responsibility for establishing workable and 
        legally supportable Family Care Plans lies with the members of 
        the Armed Forces;
            (2) notwithstanding that responsibility, commanders 
        should--
                    (A) ensure that the members of their command fully 
                understand the purpose of the Family Care Plan and its 
                limitations, including the overriding authority of 
                State courts to determine child custody arrangements 
                notwithstanding a Family Care Plan;
                    (B) understand and emphasize to their members that 
                failure to involve, or at least inform, the non-
                custodial parent of custody arrangements in 
                anticipation of an absence can undermine the Family 
                Care Plan or even render it useless, in such cases; and
                    (C) apprise their members of the risks described in 
                subparagraph (B), and strongly encourage them to seek 
                legal assistance, as far in advance of actual absences 
                as practicable;
            (3) the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security with respect to matters concerning the Coast Guard 
        when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, should 
        ensure that members of the Armed Forces update their Family 
        Care Plans and emphasize--
                    (A) the importance of prior planning;
                    (B) that Family Care Plans are necessary not only 
                for the single parent and for the dual military couple 
                but also for a married member of the Armed Forces who 
                has custody of a child pursuant to a court order or 
                separation agreement or who has custody of a child 
                whose other parent is not the current spouse of the 
                member;
                    (C) that in spite of how important Family Care 
                Plans are to readiness, they are not legal documents 
                that can change a court-mandated custodial arrangement 
                or interfere with the other parent's right to custody 
                of his or her child;
                    (D) that, to the greatest extent possible, a member 
                of the Armed Forces should inform the other parent of 
                the member's impending absence due to military orders 
                if such absence prohibits the member from fulfilling 
                the member's custody responsibilities and inform that 
                other parent of the Family Care Plan;
                    (E) that a member of the Armed Forces should 
                attempt to obtain the consent of the non-custodial or 
                adoptive parent to any Family Care Plan that would 
                leave the child in the care of a third party; and
                    (F) that if a member of the Armed Forces cannot or 
                will not contact the non-custodial parent or cannot 
                obtain that parent's consent to the Family Care Plan, 
                the commander of the member should--
                            (i) counsel the member about the 
                        implications; and
                            (ii) encourage in the strongest possible 
                        terms that the member seek immediate help from 
                        a legal assistance attorney or other qualified 
                        legal counsel; and
            (4) attorneys providing legal assistance as described in 
        paragraph (3)(F)(ii) should provide members of the Armed Forces 
        a full explanation of the dangers of not involving the non-
        custodial parent and discuss appropriate courses of action.

                      Subtitle H--Military Voting

SEC. 581. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Military and Overseas Voter 
Empowerment Act''.

SEC. 582. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The right to vote is a fundamental right.
            (2) Due to logistical, geographical, operational and 
        environmental barriers, military and overseas voters are 
        burdened by many obstacles that impact their right to vote and 
        register to vote, the most critical of which include problems 
        transmitting balloting materials and not being given enough 
        time to vote.
            (3) States play an essential role in facilitating the 
        ability of military and overseas voters to register to vote and 
        have their ballots cast and counted, especially with respect to 
        timing and improvement of absentee voter registration and 
        absentee ballot procedures.
            (4) The Department of Defense educates military and 
        overseas voters of their rights under the Uniformed and 
        Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act and plays an

SEC. 653. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AIRFARES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED 
              FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Armed Forces is comprised of over 1,450,000 active-
        duty members from every State and territory of the United 
        States who are assigned to thousands of installations, 
        stations, and ships worldwide and who oftentimes must travel 
        long distances by air at their own expense to enjoy the 
        benefits of leave and liberty.
            (2) The United States is indebted to the members of the all 
        volunteer Armed Forces and their families who protect our 
        Nation, often experiencing long separations due to the demands 
        of military service and in life threatening circumstances.
            (3) Military service often precludes long range planning 
        for leave and liberty to provide opportunities for reunions and 
        recreation with loved ones and requires changes in planning due 
        to military necessity which results in last minute changes in 
        planning.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) all United States commercial carriers should seek to 
        lend their support with flexible, generous policies applicable 
        to members of the Armed Forces who are traveling on leave or 
        liberty at their own expense; and
            (2) each United States air carrier, for all members of the 
        Armed Forces who have been granted leave or liberty and who are 
        traveling by air at their own expense, should--
                    (A) seek to provide reduced air fares that are 
                comparable to the lowest airfare for ticketed flights 
                and that eliminate to the maximum extent possible 
                advance purchase requirements;
                    (B) seek to eliminate change fees or charges and 
                any penalties for military personnel;
                    (C) seek to eliminate or reduce baggage and excess 
                weight fees;
                    (D) offer flexible terms that allow members of the 
                Armed Forces on active duty to purchase, modify, or 
                cancel tickets without time restrictions, and to waive 
                fees (including baggage fees), ancillary costs, or 
                penalties; and
                    (E) seek to take proactive measures to ensure that 
                all airline employees, particularly those who issue 
                tickets and respond to members of the Armed Forces and 
                their family members are trained in the policies of the

        endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make extraordinary 
        sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-year careers in 
        protecting freedom for all Americans.
            (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices 
        are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the current 
        combat operations, but also during the wars of the last 60 
        years when current retired members of the Armed Forces were on 
        continuous call to go in harm's way when and as needed.
            (3) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary 
        sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of 
        retirement benefits, including lifetime health benefits, that a 
        grateful Nation provides for those who choose to subordinate 
        their personal life to the national interest for so many years.
            (4) Currently serving and retired members of the uniformed 
        services and their families and survivors deserve benefits 
        equal to their commitment and service to our Nation.
            (5) Many employers are curtailing health benefits and 
        shifting costs to their employees, which may result in retired 
        members of the Armed Forces returning to the Department of 
        Defense, and its TRICARE program, for health care benefits 
        during retirement, and contribute to health care cost growth.
            (6) Defense health costs also expand as a result of 
        service-unique military readiness requirements, wartime 
        requirements, and other necessary requirements that represent 
        the ``cost of business'' for the Department of Defense.
            (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts 
        to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, too 
        many of those efforts have been devoted to shifting a larger 
        share of the costs of benefits under that program to retired 
        members of the Armed Forces who have earned health care 
        benefits in return for a career of military service.
            (8) In some cases health care providers refuse to accept 
        TRICARE patients because that program pays less than other 
        public and private payors and imposes unique administrative 
        requirements.
            (9) The Department of Defense records deposits to the 
        Department of Defense Military Retiree Health Care Fund as 
        discretionary costs to the Department in spite of legislation 
        enacted in 2006 that requires such deposits to be made directly 
        from the Treasury of the United States.
            (10) As a result, annual payments for the future costs of 
        servicemember health care continue to compete with other 
        readiness needs of the Armed Forces.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have an 
        obligation to provide health care benefits to retired members 
        of the Armed Forces that equals the quality of their selfless 
        service to our country;
            (2) past proposals by the Department of Defense to impose 
        substantial fee increases on military beneficiaries have failed 
        to acknowledge properly the findings addressed in subsection 
        (a); and
            (3) the Department of Defense has many additional options 
        to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that do 
        not disadvantage retired members of the Armed Forces who 
        participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE program, and 
        should pursue any and all such options rather than seeking 
        large increases for enrollment fees, deductibles, and 
        copayments for such retirees, and their families or survivors, 
        who do participate in that program.

SEC. 707. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS REGARDING OPTIONS FOR 
              ENROLLMENT UNDER MEDICARE PART B.

    Chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding at

Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395j et seq.). The Secretary of Defense shall 
consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to accurately 
identify and notify individuals described in subsection (b) under this 
subsection.
    ``(b) Individuals Described.--An individual described in this

SEC. 903. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE INSTITUTE FOR 
              SECURITY COOPERATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation was established by section 911 of the Floyd D. 
        Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 
        (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398; 114 Stat. 1654A-
        226).
            (2) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation provides professional education and training to 
        military personnel, law enforcement officials, and civilian 
        personnel in support of the democratic principles set forth in 
        the Charter of the Organization of American States. The 
        Institute effectively promotes mutual knowledge, transparency, 
        confidence, and cooperation among participating nations. It 
        also effectively builds strategic partnerships to address the 
        great security challenges in the region while encouraging 
        democratic values, respect for human rights, subordination to 
        civilian authority, and understanding of United States customs 
        and traditions.
            (3) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation supports the Security Cooperation Guidance of the 
        Secretary of Defense by addressing the building partner 
        capacity education and training needs of the United States 
        Southern Command and the United States Northern Command.
            (4) In a joint letter, dated April 9, 2009, General 
        Renuart, the Commander of the United States Northern Command, 
        and Admiral Stavridis, the Commander of the United States 
        Southern Command, write ``[t]he outstanding service that 
        WHINSEC provides directly supports the United States Southern 
        Command's and United States Northern Command's strategic 
        objective of fostering lasting partnerships that will ensure 
        security, enhance stability, and enable prosperity throughout 
        the Americas'' and notes that the Institute provides 
        ``culturally-sensitive training, with a strong emphasis on the 
        values of democracy and human rights''.
            (5) In establishing the Western Hemisphere Institute for 
        Security Cooperation, Congress mandates that participants at 
        the Institute receive a minimum of 8 hours of instruction on 
        human rights, due process, the rule of law, the role of the 
        Armed Forces in a democratic society, and civilian control of 
        the military. Every course devotes at least 10 percent of its 
        course work to democracy, ethics, and human rights issues. The 
        Institute is also required to develop a curriculum that 
        includes leadership development, counterdrug operations, 
        peacekeeping, resource management, and disaster relief 
        planning. In fiscal year 2008, the Institute presented 39 
        courses and hosted 1,196 students in residence at Fort Benning, 
        Georgia, of whom 292 were police personnel, and trained an 
        additional 280 students through the Mobile Training Team 
        programs of the Institute.
            (6) Congress mandated the formation of a Federal advisory 
        committee--an oversight committee unique to the Western 
        Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. It provides 
        recommendations and an independent review of the Institute and 
        its curriculum to ensure the uniform adherence of the Institute 
        to United States law, regulations, and policies. The Board of 
        Visitors of the Institute includes the Chairman and Ranking 
        Member of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the 
        Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services 
        of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of State, the 
        Commander of the United States Southern Command, the Commander 
        of the United States Northern Command, the Commander of the 
        United States Training and Doctrine Command, and six members 
        designated by the Secretary of Defense. The six members 
        designated by the Secretary of Defense include, to the extent 
        practicable, individuals from academia and the religious and 
        human rights communities. In addition to the 13 members of the 
        Board of Visitors, advisors and subject matter experts assist 
        the Board in areas the Board considers necessary and 
        appropriate.
            (7) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation operates in accordance with section 8130 of the 
        Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-
        262; 112 Stat. 2335) that prohibits United States military 
        assistance to foreign military units that violate human rights, 
        including security assistance programs funded through 
        appropriations available for foreign operations and training 
        programs funded through appropriations made available for the 
        Department of Defense.
            (8) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation does not select students for participation in its 
        courses. A partner nation nominates students to attend the 
        Institute, and in accordance with the law of the United States 
        and the policies of the Department of Defense and the 
        Department of State, the United States Embassy in such partner 
        nation screens and conducts background checks on such nominees. 
        The vetting process of nominees for participation in the 
        Institute includes a background check by United States 
        embassies in partner nations, as well as checks by the Bureau 
        of Western Hemisphere Affairs and the Bureau of Democracy, 
        Human Rights, and Labor at the Department of State. The 
        Department of State also uses the Abuse Case Evaluation System, 
        a central database that aggregates human rights abuse data into 
        a single, searchable location, to ensure nominees have not been 
        accused of any human rights abuses.
            (9) The training provided by the Western Hemisphere 
        Institute for Security Cooperation is transparent and the 
        Institute is open to visitors at any time. Visitors are welcome 
        to sit in on classes, talk with students and faculty, and 
        review instructional materials. Every year, the Institute hosts 
        more than a thousand visiting students, faculty, civilian, and 
        military officials.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation--
                    (A) offers quality professional military bilingual 
                instruction for military officers and noncommissioned 
                officers that promotes democracy, subordination to 
                civilian authority, and respect for human rights; and
                    (B) is uniquely positioned to support the 
                modernization of Latin America security forces as they 
                work to transcend their own controversial pasts;
            (2) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation is building partner capacity which enhances 
        regional and global security while encouraging respect for 
        human rights and promoting democratic principles among eligible 
        military personnel, law enforcement officials, and civilians of 
        nations of the Western Hemisphere;
            (3) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation is an invaluable education and training facility 
        whose curriculum is not duplicated in any of the military 
        departments and is not replaceable by professional military 
        education funded by appropriations for International Military 
        Education and Training (IMET), which education is not conducted 
        in Spanish and does not concentrate on regional challenges; and
            (4) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 
        Cooperation is an essential tool to educate future generations 
        of Latin American leaders and improve United States 
        relationships with partner nations that are working with the 
        United States to promote democracy, prosperity, and stability 
        in the Western Hemisphere.

Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 303) is repealed.

SEC. 1013. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF A 313-SHIP NAVY.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of the Navy has a stated requirement for 
        a 313-ship fleet.
            (2) The Navy can better meet this requirement--
                    (A) by procuring sufficient numbers of new ships; 
                and
                    (B) by ensuring the sound material condition of 
                existing ships that will enable the Navy to utilize 
                them for their full planned service lives.
            (3) When procuring new classes of ships, the Navy must 
        exercise greater caution than it has exhibited to date in 
        proceeding from one stage of the acquisition cycle to the next 
        before a ship program has achieved a level of maturity that 
        significantly lowers the risk of cost growth and schedule 
        slippage.
            (4) In retaining existing assets, the Navy can do a much 
        better job of achieving the full planned service lives of ships 
        and extending the service lives of certain ships so as to keep 
        their unique capabilities in the fleet while the Navy takes the 
        time necessary to develop and field next-generation 
        capabilities under a low risk program.
            (5) The Navy can undertake certain development approaches 
        that can help the Navy control the total costs of ownership of 
        a ship or class of ships, including emphasizing common hull 
        designs, open architecture combat systems, and other common 
        ship systems in order to achieve efficiency in acquiring and 
        supporting various classes of ships.
            (6) The Navy needs to continue its efforts toward achieving 
        an open architecture for existing combat systems, as this will 
        have great benefit in reducing the costs and risks of fielding 
        new classes of ships, and will yield recurring savings from 
        reducing the costs of buying later ships in a program and 
        reducing life cycle support costs for ships and classes of 
        ships.
            (7) The Navy can also undertake other measures to acquire 
        new ships and maintain the current fleet with greater 
        efficiency, including--
                    (A) greater use of fixed-price contracts;
                    (B) maximizing competition (or the option of 
                competition) throughout the life cycle of its ships;
                    (C) entering into multiyear contracts when 
                warranted; and
                    (D) employing an incremental approach to developing 
                new technologies.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Navy should meet its requirement for a 313-ship 
        fleet;
            (2) the Navy should take greater care to achieve the full 
        planned service life of existing ships and reduce the incidence 
        of early ship decommissioning;
            (3) the Navy should exercise greater restraint on the 
        acquisition process for ships in order to achieve on-time, on-
        cost shipbuilding programs; and
            (4) Congress should support the Navy when it is acting 
        responsibly to undertake measures that can help the Navy 
        achieve the requirement for a 313-ship fleet and maintain a 
        fleet that is adequate to meet the national security needs of 
        the United States.

SEC. 1014. DESIGNATION OF U.S.S. CONSTITUTION AS AMERICA'S SHIP OF 
              STATE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The 3rd Congress authorized, in the Act entitled ``An 
        Act to Provide a Naval Armament'', approved on March 27, 1794 
        (1 Stat. 350, Chap. XII), the construction of six frigates as 
        the first ships to be built for the United States Navy.
            (2) One of the six frigates was built in Boston between 
        1794 and 1797, and is the only one of the original six ships to 
        survive.
            (3) President George Washington named this frigate 
        ``Constitution'' to represent the Nation's founding document.
            (4) President Thomas Jefferson, asserting the right of the 
        United States to trade on the high seas, dispatched the frigate 
        Constitution in 1803 as the flagship of the Mediterranean 
        Squadron to end the depredations of the Barbary States against 
        United States ships and shipping, which led to a treaty being 
        signed with the Bashaw of Tripoli in the Captain's cabin aboard 
        the frigate Constitution on June 4, 1805.
            (5) The frigate Constitution, with her defeat of HMS 
        Guerriere, secured the first major victory by the young United 
        States Navy against the Royal Navy during the War of 1812, 
        gaining in the process the nickname ``Old Ironsides'', which 
        she has proudly carried since.
            (6) Congress awarded gold medals to four of the ship's 
        commanding officers (Preble, Hull, Stewart, and Bainbridge), a 
        record unmatched by any other United States Navy vessel.
            (7) The frigate Constitution emerged from the War of 1812 
        undefeated, having secured victories over three additional 
        ships of the Royal Navy.
            (8) As early as May 1815, the frigate Constitution had 
        already been adopted as a symbol of the young Republic, as 
        attested by the [Washington] National Intelligencer which 
        proclaimed, ``Let us keep `Old Ironsides' at home. She has, 
        literally become the Nation's Ship . . . and should thus be 
        preserved . . . in honorable pomp, as a glorious Monument of 
        her own, and our other Naval Victories.''.
            (9) Rumors in 1830 that ``Old Ironsides,'' an aging 
        frigate, was about to be scrapped resulted in a public uproar 
        demanding that the ship be restored and preserved, spurred by 
        Oliver Wendell Holmes' immortal poem ``Old Ironsides''.
            (10) ``Old Ironsides'' circumnavigated the world between 
        1844 and 1846, showing the American flag as she searched for 
        future coaling stations that would eventually fuel the steam-
        powered navy of the United States.
            (11) The first Pope to set foot on United States sovereign 
        territory was Pius IX onboard the frigate Constitution in 1849.
            (12) ``Old Ironsides'' helped evacuate the United States 
        Naval Academy from Annapolis, Maryland, to Newport, Rhode 
        Island, in 1860 to prevent this esteemed ship from falling into 
        Confederate hands.
            (13) Congressman John F. ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald 
        introduced legislation in 1896 to return ``Old Ironsides'' from 
        the Portsmouth (New Hampshire) Naval Shipyard, where she was 
        moored pier side and largely forgotten, to Boston for her 100th 
        birthday.
            (14) Thousands of school children contributed pennies 
        between 1925 an 1927 to help fund a much needed restoration for 
        ``Old Ironsides''.
            (15) Between 1931 and 1934, more than 4,500,000 Americans 
        gained inspiration, at the depth of the Great Depression, by 
        going aboard ``Old Ironsides'' as she was towed to 76 ports on 
        the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts.
            (16) The 83rd Congress enacted the Act of July 23, 1954 (68 
        Stat. 527, chapter 565), which directed the Secretary of the 
        Navy to transfer to the States and appropriate commissions four 
        other historic ships then on the Navy inventory, and to repair 
        and equip U.S.S. Constitution, as much as practicable, to her 
        original condition, but not for active service.
            (17) Queen Elizabeth II paid a formal visit to U.S.S. 
        Constitution in 1976, at the start of her state visit marking 
        the Bicentennial of the United States.
            (18) The U.S.S. Constitution, in celebration of her 
        bicentennial, returned to sea under sail on July 21, 1997 for 
        the first time since 1881, proudly setting sails purchased by 
        the contributions of thousands of pennies given by school 
        children across the United States.
            (19) The U.S.S. Constitution is the oldest commissioned 
        warship afloat in the world.
            (20) The U.S.S. Constitution is a National Historic 
        Landmark.
            (21) The U.S.S. Constitution continues to perform official, 
        ceremonial duties, including in recent years hosting a 
        congressional dinner honoring the late Senator John Chafee of 
        Rhode Island, a special salute for the dedication of the John 
        Moakley Federal Courthouse, a luncheon honoring British 
        Ambassador Sir David Manning, and a special underway 
        demonstration during which 60 Medal of Honor recipients each 
        received a personal Medal of Honor flag.
            (22) The U.S.S. Constitution celebrated on October 21, 
        2007, the 210th anniversary of her launching.
            (23) The U.S.S. Constitution will remain a commissioned 
        ship in the United States Navy, with the Navy retaining control 
        of the ship, its material condition, and its employment.
            (24) The U.S.S. Constitution's primary mission will remain 
        education and public outreach, and any Ship of State functions 
        will be an adjunct to the ship's primary mission.
    (b) Designation as America's Ship of State.--
            (1) In general.--The U.S.S. Constitution is hereby 
        designated as ``America's Ship of State''.
            (2) References.--The U.S.S. Constitution may be known or 
        referred to as ``America's Ship of State''.
            (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        the President, Vice President, executive branch officials, and 
        members of Congress should utilize the U.S.S. Constitution for 
        the conducting of pertinent matters of state, such as hosting 
        visiting heads of state, signing legislation relating to the 
        Armed Forces, and signing maritime related treaties.
            (4) Fee or reimbursement structure for non-department of 
        the navy use.--The Secretary of the Navy shall determine an 
        appropriate fee or reimbursement structure for any non-
        Department of the Navy entities using the U.S.S. Constitution 
        for Ship of State purposes.

    ``(b) Authority for Military Commissions Under This Chapter.--The 
President is authorized to establish military commissions under this 
chapter for offenses triable by military commission as provided in this 
chapter.
    ``(c) Construction of Provisions.--The procedures for military 
commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon the procedures for 
trial by general courts-martial under chapter 47 of this title (the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice). Chapter 47 of this title does not, 
by its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as 
specifically provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the 
provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms inapplicable 
to military commissions. The judicial construction and application of 
chapter 47 of this title, while instructive, is therefore not of its 
own force binding on military commissions established under this 
chapter.
    ``(d) Inapplicability of Certain Provisions.--(1) The following 
provisions of this title shall not apply to trial by military 
commission under this chapter:
            ``(A) Section 810 (article 10 of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice), relating to speedy trial, including any rule 
        of courts-martial relating to speedy trial.

        and (d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to 
        compulsory self-incrimination.
            ``(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.
    ``(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall apply to 
trial by military commission under this chapter only to the extent 
provided by the terms of such provisions or by this chapter.
    ``(e) Treatment of Rulings and Precedents.--The findings, holdings, 
interpretations, and other precedents of military commissions under 
this chapter may not be introduced or considered in any hearing, trial, 
or other proceeding of a court-martial convened under chapter 47 of 
this title. The findings, holdings, interpretations, and other 
precedents of military commissions under this chapter may not form the 
basis of any holding, decision, or other determination of a court-
martial convened under that chapter.
    ``(f) Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Private Right of 
Action.--No alien unprivileged enemy belligerent subject to trial by 
military commission under this chapter may invoke the Geneva 
Conventions as a basis for a private right of action.
``Sec. 948c. Persons subject to military commissions
    ``Any alien unprivileged enemy belligerent having engaged in 
hostilities or having supported hostilities against the United States 
is subject to trial by military commission as set forth in this 
chapter.
``Sec. 948d. Jurisdiction of military commissions
    ``A military commission under this chapter shall have jurisdiction 
to try persons subject to this chapter for any offense made punishable 
by this chapter, sections 904 and 906 of this title (articles 104 and 
106 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), or the law of war, and 
may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any 
punishment not forbidden by this chapter, including the penalty of 
death when specifically authorized under this chapter. A military 
commission is a competent tribunal to make a finding sufficient for 
jurisdiction.

this chapter has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental 
responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.
    ``(c) Findings Following Assertion of Defense.--Whenever lack of 
mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is 
properly at issue in a military commission under this chapter, the

mental responsibility under this section and shall charge the members 
to find the accused--
            ``(1) guilty;
            ``(2) not guilty; or

or an interlocutory question (other than the factual issue of mental 
responsibility of the accused) is conclusive and constitutes the ruling 
of the military commission. However, a military judge may change his 
ruling at any time during the trial.
    ``(c) Instructions Prior to Vote.--Before a vote is taken of the 
findings of a military commission under this chapter, the military

members as to the elements of the offense and charge the members--
            ``(1) that the accused must be presumed to be innocent 
        until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence 
        beyond a reasonable doubt;
            ``(2) that in the case being considered, if there is a 
        reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must 
        be resolved in favor of the accused and he must be acquitted;
            ``(3) that, if there is reasonable doubt as to the degree 
        of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which

        permit the trial counsel to make a request for an authorization 
        under paragraph (1) in the form of an ex parte presentation to 
        the extent necessary to protect classified information, in 
        accordance with the practice of the Federal courts under the 
        Classified Information Procedures Act (18 U.S.C. App.). If the 
        military judge enters an order granting relief following such 
        an ex parte showing, the entire text of the written submission 
        shall be sealed and preserved in the records of the military 
        commission to be made available to the appellate court in the 
        event of an appeal.

        grant the request of the trial counsel to substitute a summary 
        or to substitute a statement admitting relevant facts, or to 
        provide other relief in accordance with paragraph (1), if the 
        military judge finds that the summary, statement, or other 
        relief would provide the accused with substantially the same 
        ability to make a defense as would discovery of or access to 
        the specific classified information.
    ``(c) Reconsideration.--An order of a military judge authorizing a 
request of the trial counsel to substitute, summarize, withhold, or 
prevent access to classified information under this section is not 
subject to a motion for reconsideration by the accused, if such order 
was entered pursuant to an ex parte showing under this section.

        prosecution of such accused, the accused shall, within the time 
        specified by the military judge or, where no time is specified, 
        within 30 days before trial, notify the trial counsel and the 
        military judge in writing. Such notice shall include a brief 
        description of the classified information. Whenever the accused 
        learns of additional classified information the accused

        and the military judge in writing as soon as possible 
        thereafter and shall include a brief description of the 
        classified information.

        a hearing to make all determinations concerning the use, 
        relevance, or admissibility of classified information that 
        would otherwise be made during the trial or pretrial 
        proceeding.
            ``(2) Conduct of hearing.--Upon a request by either party 
        under paragraph (1), the military judge shall conduct such a 
        hearing and shall rule prior to conducting any further 
        proceedings.
            ``(3) In camera hearing upon declaration to court by 
        appropriate official of risk of disclosure of classified 
        information.--Any hearing held pursuant to this subsection (or 
        any portion of such hearing specified in the request of a 
        knowledgeable United States official) shall be held in camera 
        if a knowledgeable United States official possessing authority 
        to classify information submits to the military judge a 
        declaration that a public proceeding may result in the 
        disclosure of classified information. Classified information is 
        not subject to disclosure under this section unless the 
        information is relevant and necessary to an element of the 
        offense or a legally cognizable defense and is otherwise 
        admissible in evidence.
            ``(4) Military judge to make determinations in writing.--As 
        to each item of classified information, the military judge 
        shall set forth in writing the basis for the determination.

            ``(1) Notice to accused.--Before any hearing is conducted 
        pursuant to a request by the trial counsel under subsection

        classified information that is at issue. Such notice shall 
        identify the specific classified information at issue whenever 
        that information previously has been made available to the 
        accused by the United States. When the United States has not 
        previously made the information available to the accused in 
        connection with the case the information may be described by 
        generic category, in such forms as the military judge may 
        approve, rather than by identification of the specific 
        information of concern to the United States.
            ``(2) Order by military judge upon request of accused.--
        Whenever the trial counsel requests a hearing under subsection 
        (a), the military judge, upon request of the accused, may order 
        the trial counsel to provide the accused, prior to trial, such 
        details as to the portion of the charge or specification at 
        issue in the hearing as are needed to give the accused fair 
        notice to prepare for the hearing.

        trial counsel pursuant to the Military Commission Rules of 
        Evidence, and in accordance with the security procedures 
        established by the military judge, the military judge shall 
        conduct a classified in camera pretrial hearing concerning the 
        admissibility of classified information.

        trial counsel to introduce otherwise admissible evidence, 
        including a substituted evidentiary foundation pursuant to the 
        procedures described in subsection (d), before a military 
        commission while protecting from disclosure the sources, 
        methods, or activities by which the United States acquired the 
        evidence if the military judge finds that the sources, methods, 
        or activities are classified, the evidence is reliable, and the 
        redaction is consistent with affording the accused a fair 
        trial.

Information.--
            ``(1) Motion by the united states.--Upon any determination 
        by the military judge authorizing the disclosure of specific 
        classified information under the procedures established by this 
        section, the trial counsel may move that, in lieu of the 
        disclosure of such specific classified information, the 
        military judge order--

                information of a statement admitting relevant facts

                prove;

                information of a summary of the specific classified 
                information; or
                    ``(C) any other procedure or redaction limiting the 
                disclosure of specific classified information.
            ``(2) Action on motion.--The military judge shall grant 
        such a motion of the trial counsel if the military judge finds 
        that the statement, summary, or other procedure or redaction 
        will provide the defendant with substantially the same ability 
        to make his defense as would disclosure of the specific 
        classified information.
            ``(3) Hearing on motion.--The military judge shall hold a 
        hearing on any motion under this subsection. Any such hearing 
        shall be held in camera at the request of a knowledgeable 
        United States official possessing authority to classify 
        information.
            ``(4) Submission of statement of damage to national 
        security if disclosure ordered.--The trial counsel may, in 
        connection with a motion under paragraph (1), submit to the 
        military judge a declaration signed by a knowledgeable United 
        States official possessing authority to classify information 
        certifying that disclosure of classified information would 
        cause identifiable damage to the national security of the 
        United States and explaining the basis for the classification 
        of such information. If so requested by the trial counsel, the 
        military judge shall examine such declaration during an ex 
        parte presentation.
    ``(e) Sealing of Records of in Camera Hearings.--If at the close of 
an in camera hearing under this section (or any portion of a hearing 
under this section that is held in camera), the military judge 
determines that the classified information at issue may not be 
disclosed or elicited at the trial or pretrial proceeding, the record 
of such in camera hearing shall be sealed and preserved for use in the 
event of an appeal. The accused may seek reconsideration of the 
military judge's determination prior to or during trial.
    ``(f) Prohibition on Disclosure of Classified Information by the 
Accused; Relief for Accused When the United States Opposes 
Disclosure.--
            ``(1) Order to prevent disclosure by accused.--Whenever the 
        military judge denies a motion by the trial counsel that the 
        judge issue an order under subsection (a), (c), or (d) and the 
        trial counsel files with the military judge a declaration 
        signed by a knowledgeable United States official possessing 
        authority to classify information objecting to disclosure of 
        the classified information at issue, the military judge shall 
        order that the accused not disclose or cause the disclosure of 
        such information.

        accused is prevented by an order under paragraph (1) from 
        disclosing or causing the disclosure of classified information, 
        the military judge shall dismiss the case; except that, when 
        the military judge determines that the interests of justice 
        would not be served by dismissal of the case, the military 
        judge shall order such other action, in lieu of dismissing the 
        charge or specification, as the military judge determines is 
        appropriate. Such action may include, but need not be limited 
        to, the following:
                    ``(A) Dismissing specified charges or 
                specifications.
                    ``(B) Finding against the United States on any 
                issue as to which the excluded classified information 
                relates.

                testimony of a witness.
            ``(3) Time for the united states to seek interlocutory 
        appeal.--An order under paragraph (2) shall not take effect 
        until the military judge has afforded the United States--
                    ``(A) an opportunity to appeal such order under 
                section 950d of this title; and

                objection to the disclosure of the classified 
                information at issue.
    ``(g) Reciprocity.--
            ``(1) Disclosure of rebuttal information.--Whenever the 
        military judge determines that classified information may be 
        disclosed in connection with a trial or pretrial proceeding, 
        the military judge shall, unless the interests of fairness do 
        not so require, order the United States to provide the accused 
        with the information it expects to use to rebut the classified 
        information. The military judge may place the United States 
        under a continuing duty to disclose such rebuttal information.
            ``(2) Sanction for failure to comply.--If the United States 
        fails to comply with its obligation under this subsection, the 
        military judge--
                    ``(A) may exclude any evidence not made the subject 
                of a required disclosure; and

                States of any witness with respect to such information.

    ``(a) Preservation of Classification Status.--Writings, recordings, 
and photographs containing classified information may be admitted into 
evidence in proceedings of military commissions under this chapter 
without change in their classification status.
    ``(b) Precautions by Military Judges.--
            ``(1) Precautions in admitting classified information into 
        evidence.--The military judge in a trial by military 
        commission, in order to prevent unnecessary disclosure of 
        classified information, may order admission into evidence of 
        only part of a writing, recording, or photograph, or may order 
        admission into evidence of the whole writing, recording, or 
        photograph with excision of some or all of the classified 
        information contained therein, unless the whole ought in 
        fairness be considered.
            ``(2) Classified information kept under seal.--The military 
        judge shall allow classified information offered or accepted 
        into evidence to remain under seal during the trial, even if 
        such evidence is disclosed in the military commission, and may, 
        upon motion by the Government, seal exhibits containing 
        classified information for any period after trial as necessary 
        to prevent a disclosure of classified information when a 
        knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to 
        classify information submits to the military judge a 
        declaration setting forth the damage to the national security 
        that the disclosure of such information reasonably could be 
        expected to cause.
    ``(c) Taking of Testimony.--
            ``(1) Objection by trial counsel.--During the examination 
        of a witness, trial counsel may object to any question or line 
        of inquiry that may require the witness to disclose classified 
        information not previously found to be admissible.
            ``(2) Action by military judge.--Following an objection 
        under paragraph (1), the military judge shall take such 
        suitable action to determine whether the response is admissible 
        as will safeguard against the compromise of any classified 
        information. Such action may include requiring trial counsel to 
        provide the military judge with a proffer of the witness' 
        response to the question or line of inquiry and requiring the 
        accused to provide the military judge with a proffer of the 
        nature of the information sought to be elicited by the accused. 
        Upon request, the military judge may accept an ex parte proffer 
        by trial counsel to the extent necessary to protect classified 
        information from disclosure, in accordance with the practice of 
        the Federal courts under the Classified Information Procedures 
        Act (18 U.S.C. App.).
    ``(d) Disclosure at Trial of Certain Statements Previously Made by 
a Witness.--
            ``(1) Motion for production of statements in possession of 
        the united states.--After a witness called by the trial counsel 
        has testified on direct examination, the military judge, on 
        motion of the accused, may order production of statements of 
        the witness in the possession of the United States which relate 
        to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. 
        This paragraph does not preclude discovery or assertion of a 
        privilege otherwise authorized.
            ``(2) Invocation of privilege by the united states.--If the 
        United States invokes a privilege, the trial counsel may 
        provide the prior statements of the witness to the military 
        judge during an ex parte presentation to the extent necessary 
        to protect classified information from disclosure, in 
        accordance with the practice of the Federal courts under the 
        Classified Information Procedures Act (18 U.S.C. App.).
            ``(3) Action by military judge on motion.--If the military 
        judge finds that disclosure of any portion of the statement 
        identified by the United States as classified would be 
        detrimental to the national security in the degree to warrant 
        classification under the applicable Executive Order, statute, 
        or regulation, that such portion of the statement is consistent 
        with the testimony of the witness, and that the disclosure of 
        such portion is not necessary to afford the accused a fair 
        trial, the military judge shall excise that portion from the 
        statement. If the military judge finds that such portion of the 
        statement is inconsistent with the testimony of the witness or 
        that its disclosure is necessary to afford the accused a fair 
        trial, the military judge, shall, upon the request of the trial 
        counsel, review alternatives to disclosure in accordance with 
        section 949p-6(d) of this title.

        those objects during an armed conflict which, by their nature, 
        location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to the war-
        fighting or war-sustaining capability of an opposing force and 
        whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization 
        would constitute a definite military advantage to the attacker 
        under the circumstances at the time of an attack.
            ``(2) The term `protected person' means any person entitled 
        to protection under one or more of the Geneva Conventions, 
        including civilians not taking an active part in hostilities, 
        military personnel placed out of combat by sickness, wounds, or 
        detention, and military medical or religious personnel.

        specifically protected by the law of war, including buildings 
        dedicated to religion, education, art, science, or charitable 
        purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the 
        sick and wounded are collected, but only if and to the extent 
        such property is not being used for military purposes or is not 
        otherwise a military objective. The term includes objects 
        properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the

the provisions of this subchapter codify offenses that have 
traditionally been triable under the law of war or otherwise triable by

SEC. 1226. REPORT ON TAIWAN'S AIR FORCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Department of Defense's (DoD) 2009 
        Annual Report on Military Power of the People's Republic of 
        China, the military balance in the Taiwan Strait has been 
        shifting in China's favor since 2000, marked by the sustained 
        deployment of advanced military equipment to the Chinese 
        military regions opposite Taiwan.
            (2) Although the DoD's 2002 Report concluded that Taiwan 
        ``has enjoyed dominance of the airspace over the Taiwan Strait 
        for many years,'' the DoD's 2009 Report states this conclusion 
        no longer holds true.
            (3) China has based 490 combat aircraft (330 fighters and 
        160 bombers) within unrefueled operational range of Taiwan, and 
        has the airfield capacity to expand that number by hundreds. In 
        contrast, Taiwan has 390 combat aircraft (all of which are 
        fighters).
            (4) Also according to the DoD's 2009 Report, China has 
        continued its build-up of conventional ballistic missiles since 
        2000, ``building a nascent capacity for conventional short-
        range ballistic missile (SRBM) strikes against Taiwan into what 
        has become one of China's primary instruments of coercion.'' At 
        this time, China has expanded its SRBM force opposite Taiwan to 
        seven brigades with a total of 1,050 through 1,150 missiles, 
        and is augmenting these forces with conventional medium-range 
        ballistic missiles systems and at least 2 land attack cruise 
        missile variants capable of ground or air launch. Advanced 
        fighters and bombers, combined with enhanced training for 
        nighttime and overwater flights, provide China's People's 
        Liberation Army (PLA) with additional capabilities for regional 
        strike or maritime interdiction operations.
            (5) Furthermore, the Report maintains, ``the security 
        situation in the Taiwan Strait is largely a function of dynamic 
        interactions among Mainland China, Taiwan, and the United 
        States. The PLA has developed and deployed military capability 
        to coerce Taiwan or attempt an invasion if necessary. PLA 
        improvements pose new challenges to Taiwan's security, which 
        has historically been based upon the PLA's inability to project 
        power across the 100 nautical-mile Taiwan Strait, natural 
        geographic advantages of island defense, Taiwan's armed forces' 
        technological superiority, and the possibility of U.S. 
        intervention''.
            (6) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 requires that, in 
        furtherance of the principle of maintaining peace and stability 
        in the Western Pacific region, the United States shall make 
        available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services 
        in such quantity ``as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to 
        maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,'' allowing that 
        ``the President and the Congress shall determine the nature and 
        quantity of such defense articles and services based solely 
        upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan . . .''.
    (b) Report to Congress on Taiwan's Current Air Force and Future 
Self-Defense Requirements.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress a 
report, in both classified and unclassified form, containing the 
following:
            (1) A thorough and complete assessment of the current state 
        of Taiwan's Air Force, including--
                    (A) the number and type of aircraft;
                    (B) the age of aircraft; and
                    (C) the capability of those aircraft.
            (2) An assessment of the effectiveness of the aircraft in 
        the face of a full-scale concerted missile and air campaign by 
        China, in which China uses its most modern surface-to-air 
        missiles currently deployed along its seacoast.
            (3) An analysis of the specific weapons systems and 
        platforms that Taiwan would need to provide for it's self-
        defense and maintain control of its own air space.
            (4) Options for the United States to assist Taiwan in 
        achieving those capabilities.
            (5) A 5-year plan for fulfilling the obligations of the 
        United States under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide for 
        Taiwan's self-defense and aid Taiwan in maintaining control of 
        its own air space.

                       Subtitle C--Other Matters

SEC. 1231. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF MEASURES OF PROGRESS 
              TO EVALUATE UNITED STATES STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES IN 
              AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The President announced a new strategy for Afghanistan 
        and Pakistan on March 27, 2009, that calls for a commitment of 
        more resources and a significant increase in the number of 
        United States Armed Forces deployed to the region.
            (2) It is the obligation of the United States Government to 
        the members of the Armed Forces, and to all Americans, that 
        their sacrifices be met by a clear method for evaluating the 
        progress toward achieving the objectives in the new strategy of 
        the Administration.
            (3) The President stated, with reference to the strategy 
        for Afghanistan and Pakistan, that ``going forward, we will not 
        blindly stay the course. Instead, we will set clear metrics to 
        measure progress and hold ourselves accountable. We'll 
        consistently assess our efforts to train Afghan security forces 
        and our progress in combating insurgents. We will measure the 
        growth of Afghanistan's economy, and its illicit narcotics 
        production. And we will review whether we are using the right 
        tools and tactics to make progress towards accomplishing our 
        goals''.
            (4) Since the announcement of the new strategy of the 
        Administration on March 27, 2009, key leaders in the 
        Administration, including in the Department of Defense and 
        Department of State, have testified before Congress that 
        progress measures were needed to evaluate performance toward 
        achieving the strategic objectives of the United States in 
        Afghanistan and Pakistan and that the Administration was 
        undertaking the process of reviewing and developing measures of 
        progress.
            (5) Key leaders in the Administration further assured 
        Congress that the Administration would not only share the 
        measures of progress with Congress, but would also invite 
        review and comment by Congress on proposed measures of 
        progress.
            (6) The establishment of both clear objectives and a means 
        to impartially measure success toward those objectives will 
        expound to the American people what the United States and its 
        partners intend to accomplish in and for Afghanistan and 
        Pakistan.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Administration should, through the coordination of 
        the Departments of Defense and State, expeditiously submit to 
        Congress a comprehensive list of measures of progress with 
        regard to United States strategic objectives in Afghanistan and 
        Pakistan;
            (2) the comprehensive list under paragraph (1) should 
        include newly-established measures of progress as well as such 
        measures of progress previously established pursuant to section 
        1230(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
        Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 385) that continue to 
        be relevant to the current United States strategy for 
        Afghanistan and Pakistan;
            (3) the Administration should incorporate the comprehensive 
        list under paragraph (1) with each report submitted under 
        sections 1230 and 1232 of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (122 Stat. 385, 392) and should 
        review, and if necessary modify, the comprehensive list for 
        each such report; and
            (4) upon submittal to Congress of the reports required by 
        sections 1230 and 1232 of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 2008, the Administration should provide an 
        assessment of each measure of progress by--
                    (A) setting forth the measure of progress being 
                evaluated;
                    (B) providing data used to evaluate the measure of 
                progress;
                    (C) providing an evaluation of the performance of 
                the particular measure of progress; and
                    (D) providing a comprehensive assessment of how the 
                performance of the particular measure of progress 
                hinders or enhances the overall performance toward 
                achieving strategic objectives of the United States in 
                Afghanistan and Pakistan.

SEC. 1232. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPOSING SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
              THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran, combined with its development of 
        unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and support for 
        international terrorism, represent a grave threat to the 
        security of the United States and United States allies in 
        Europe, the Middle East, and around the world.
            (2) The United States and other responsible countries have 
        a vital interest in working together to prevent the Government 
        of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a nuclear 
        weapons capability.
            (3) As President Barack Obama said, ``Iran obtaining a 
        nuclear weapon would not only be a threat to Israel and a 
        threat to the United States, but would be profoundly 
        destabilizing in the international community as a whole and 
        could set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that would 
        be extraordinarily dangerous for all concerned, including for 
        Iran.''.
            (4) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly 
        called attention to the illicit nuclear activities of the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran, and, as a result, the United Nations 
        Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions designed to 
        encourage the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
        cease those activities and comply with its obligations under 
        the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at 
        Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into 
        force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-
        Proliferation Treaty'').
            (5) The Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on 
        several Iranian banks, including Bank Melli, Bank Saderat, Bank 
        Sepah, and Bank Mellat, for their involvement in proliferation 
        activities or support for terrorist groups.
            (6) The Central Bank of Iran, the keystone of Iran's 
        financial system and its principal remaining lifeline to the 
        international banking system, has engaged in deceptive 
        financial practices and facilitated such practices among banks 
        involved in proliferation activities or support for terrorist 
        groups, including Bank Sepah and Bank Melli, in order to evade 
        sanctions imposed by the United States and the United Nations.
            (7) On April 8, 2009, the United States formally extended 
        an offer to engage in direct diplomacy with the Government of 
        the Islamic Republic of Iran through negotiations with the five 
        permanent members of the United States Security Council and 
        Germany (commonly referred to as the ``P5-plus-1 process''), in 
        the hope of resolving all outstanding disputes between the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States.
            (8) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has yet 
        to make a formal reply to the April 8, 2009, offer of direct 
        diplomacy by the United States or to engage in direct diplomacy 
        with the United States through the P5-plus-1 process.
            (9) On July 8, 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France 
        warned that the Group of Eight major powers will give the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran until September 2009 to accept 
        negotiations with respect to its nuclear activities or face 
        tougher sanctions.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran should--
                    (A) seize the historic offer put forward by 
                President Barack Obama to engage in direct diplomacy 
                with the United States;
                    (B) suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing 
                activities, including research and development, and 
                work on all heavy-water related projects, including the 
                construction of a research reactor moderated by heavy 
                water, as demanded by multiple resolutions of the 
                United Nations Security Council; and
                    (C) come into full compliance with the Nuclear Non-
                Proliferation Treaty, including the additional protocol 
                to the Treaty; and
            (2) the President should impose sanctions on the Central 
        Bank of Iran and any other Iranian bank engaged in 
        proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups, as 
        well as any other sanctions the President determines 
        appropriate, if--
                    (A) the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
                Iran--
                            (i) has not accepted the offer by the 
                        United States to engage in direct diplomacy 
                        through the P5-plus-1 process before the Summit 
                        of the Group of 20 (G-20) in Pittsburgh, 
                        Pennsylvania, in September 2009; or
                            (ii) has not suspended all enrichment-
                        related and reprocessing activities and work on 
                        all heavy-water related projects within 60 days 
                        of the conclusion of that Summit; and
                    (B) the United Nations Security Council has failed 
                to adopt significant and meaningful additional 
                sanctions on the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
                Iran.

SEC. 1233. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ENFORCEMENT AND IMPOSITION OF 
              SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA; REVIEW TO 
              DETERMINE WHETHER NORTH KOREA SHOULD BE RE-LISTED AS A 
              STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) On April 5, 2009, the Government of North Korea tested 
        an intermediate range ballistic missile in violation of United 
        Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006) and 1718 
        (2006).
            (2) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a 
        statement on North Korea, stating that ``Preventing the 
        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of 
        delivery is a high priority for my administration'', and 
        adding, ``North Korea has ignored its international 
        obligations, rejected unequivocal calls for restraint, and 
        further isolated itself from the community of nations''.
            (3) On April 15, 2009, the Government of North Korea 
        announced it was expelling international inspectors from its 
        Yongbyon nuclear facility and ending its participation in the 
        Six Party Talks for the Denuclearization of the Korean 
        Peninsula.
            (4) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North Korea 
        conducted a second nuclear test, in disregard of United Nations 
        Security Council Resolution 1718, which was issued in 2006 
        following the first such test and which demanded that North 
        Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests or launches of a 
        ballistic missile.
            (5) The State Department's 2008 Human Rights Report on 
        North Korea, issued on February 25, 2009, found that human 
        rights conditions inside North Korea remained poor, prison 
        conditions are harsh and life-threatening, and citizens were 
        denied basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, press, 
        assembly, religion, and association.
            (6) Pursuant to section 102(b)(2)(E) of the Arms Export 
        Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2799aa-1(b)(2)(E)), President George W. 
        Bush, on February 7, 2007, notified Congress that the United 
        States Government would oppose the extension of any loan or 
        financial or technical assistance to North Korea by any 
        international financial institution and the prohibition on 
        support for the extension of such loans or assistance remains 
        in effect.
            (7) On June 12, 2009, the United Nations Security Council 
        passed Resolution 1874, condemning North Korea's nuclear test, 
        imposing a sweeping embargo on all arms trade with North Korea, 
        and requiring member states not to provide financial support or 
        other financial services that could contribute to North Korea's 
        nuclear-related or missile-related activities or other 
        activities related to weapons of mass destruction.
            (8) On July 15, 2009, the Sanctions Committee of the United 
        Nations Security Council, pursuant to United Nations Security 
        Council Resolution 1874, imposed a travel ban on five North 
        Korean individuals and asset freezes on five more North Korean 
        entities for their involvement in nuclear weapons and ballistic 
        missile development programs, marking the first time the United 
        Nations has imposed a travel ban on North Koreans.
            (9) On June 10, 2008, the Government of North Korea issued 
        a statement, subsequently conveyed directly to the United 
        States Government, affirming that North Korea, ``will firmly 
        maintain its consistent stand of opposing all forms of 
        terrorism and any support to it and will fulfill its 
        responsibility and duty in the struggle against terrorism.''.
            (10) The June 10, 2008, statement by the Government of 
        North Korea also pledged that North Korea would take ``active 
        part in the international efforts to prevent substance, 
        equipment and technology to be used for the production of nukes 
        and biochemical and radioactive weapons from finding their ways 
        to the terrorists and the organizations that support them''.
            (11) On June 26, 2008, President George W. Bush certified 
        that--
                    (A) the Government of North Korea had not provided 
                any support for international terrorism during the 
                preceding 6-month period; and
                    (B) the Government of North Korea had provided 
                assurances that it will not support acts of 
                international terrorism in the future.
            (12) The President's June 26 certification concluded, based 
        on all available information, that there was ``no credible 
        evidence at this time of ongoing support by the DPRK for 
        international terrorism'' and that ``there is no credible or 
        sustained reporting at this time that supports allegations 
        (including as cited in recent reports by the Congressional 
        Research Service) that the DPRK has provided direct or witting 
        support for Hezbollah, Tamil Tigers, or the Iranian 
        Revolutionary Guard''.
            (13) The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 
        2008, in a section on North Korea, state, ``The Democratic 
        People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was not known to have 
        sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean 
        Airlines flight in 1987.''.
            (14) The Country Reports on Terrorism 2008 also state, ``A 
        state that directs WMD resources to terrorists, or one from 
        which enabling resources are clandestinely diverted, poses a 
        grave WMD terrorism threat. Although terrorist organizations 
        will continue to seek a WMD capability independent of state 
        programs, the sophisticated WMD knowledge and resources of a 
        state could enable a terrorist capability. State sponsors of 
        terrorism and all nations that fail to live up to their 
        international counterterrorism and nonproliferation obligations 
        deserve greater scrutiny as potential facilitators of WMD 
        terrorism.''.
            (15) On October 11, 2008, the Secretary of State, pursuant 
        to the President's certification, removed North Korea from its 
        list of state sponsors of terrorism, on which North Korea had 
        been placed in 1988.
    (b) Report on Conduct of North Korea.--Not later than 30 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to 
Congress a detailed report examining the conduct of the Government of 
North Korea since June 26, 2008, based on all available information, to 
determine whether North Korea meets the statutory criteria for listing 
as a state sponsor of terrorism. The report shall--
            (1) present any credible evidence of support by the 
        Government of North Korea for acts of terrorism, terrorists, or 
        terrorist organizations;
            (2) examine what steps the Government of North Korea has 
        taken to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledge to prevent weapons 
        of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists; 
        and
            (3) assess the effectiveness of re-listing North Korea as a 
        state sponsor of terrorism as a tool to accomplish the 
        objectives of the United States with respect to North Korea, 
        including completely eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons 
        programs, preventing North Korean proliferation of weapons of 
        mass destruction, and encouraging North Korea to abide by 
        international norms with respect to human rights.
    (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States should--
                    (A) vigorously enforce United Nations Security 
                Council Resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) and 
                other sanctions in place with respect to North Korea 
                under United States law;
                    (B) urge all member states of the United Nations to 
                fully implement the sanctions imposed by United Nations 
                Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874; and
                    (C) explore the imposition of additional unilateral 
                and multilateral sanctions against North Korea in 
                furtherance of United States national security;
            (2) the conduct of North Korea constitutes a threat to the 
        northeast Asian region and to international peace and security;
            (3) if the United States determines that the Government of 
        North Korea has provided assistance to terrorists or engaged in 
        state sponsored acts of terrorism, the Secretary of State 
        should immediately list North Korea as a state sponsor of 
        terrorism; and
            (4) if the United States determines that the Government of 
        North Korea has failed to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledges, 
        the Secretary of State should immediately list North Korea as a 
        state sponsor of terrorism.
    (d) State Sponsor of Terrorism Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``state sponsor of terrorism'' means a country that 
has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism for 
purposes of--
            (1) section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 
        (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) (as continued in effect pursuant to 
        the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
        et seq.));
            (2) section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
        2780); or
            (3) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
        U.S.C. 2371).

SEC. 1234. REPORT ON THE PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
              STOCKPILE, NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMPLEX, AND DELIVERY 
              PLATFORMS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FOLLOW-ON

    (b) Sense of the Senate on Follow-on Negotiations to the START 
Treaty.--The Senate urges the President to maintain the stated position 
of the United States that the follow-on treaty to the START Treaty not 
include any limitations on the ballistic missile defense systems, space 
capabilities, or advanced conventional weapons systems of the United 
States.

SEC. 1235. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CONTINUED SUPPORT BY THE UNITED STATES 
              FOR A STABLE AND DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF IRAQ.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The men and women of the United States Armed Forces who 
        have served or are serving in the Republic of Iraq have done so 
        with the utmost bravery and courage and deserve the respect and 
        gratitude of the people of the United States and the people of 
        Iraq.
            (2) The leadership of Generals David Petraeus and Raymond 
        Odierno, as the Commanders of the Multi-National Force Iraq, as 
        well as Ambassador Ryan Crocker, was instrumental in bringing 
        stability and success to Iraq.
            (3) The strategy known as the surge was a critical factor 
        contributing to significant security gains and facilitated the 
        economic, political, and social gains that have occurred in 
        Iraq since 2007.
            (4) The people of Iraq have begun to develop a stable 
        government and stable society because of the security gains 
        following the surge and the willingness of the people of Iraq 
        to accept the ideals of a free and fair democratic society over 
        the tyranny espoused by Al Qaeda and other terrorist 
        organizations.
            (5) The security gains in Iraq must be carefully maintained 
        so that those fragile gains can be solidified and expanded 
        upon, primarily by citizens of Iraq in service to their 
        country, with the support of the United States as appropriate.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a stable and democratic Republic of Iraq is in the 
        long-term national security interest of the United States;
            (2) the people and the Government of the United States 
        should help the people of Iraq promote the stability of their 
        country and peace in the region; and
            (3) the United States should be a long-term strategic 
        partner with the Government and the people of Iraq in support 
        of their efforts to build democracy, good governance, and peace 
        and stability in the region.

SEC. 1236. REPORT ON FEASIBILITY AND DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING 
              GENERAL UNIFORM PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES FOR THE 
              PROVISION OF MONETARY ASSISTANCE BY THE UNITED STATES TO 
              CIVILIAN FOREIGN NATIONALS FOR LOSSES INCIDENT TO COMBAT 
              ACTIVITIES OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a 
report on the feasibility and the desirability of establishing general 
uniform procedures and guidelines for the provision by the United 
States of monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals for losses, 
injuries, or death (hereafter ``harm'') incident to combat activities 
of the United States Armed Forces during contingency operations.
    (b) Matters To Be Included in Report.--The Secretary shall include 
in the report the following:
            (1) A description of the authorities under laws in effect 
        as of the date of the enactment of this Act for the United 
        States to provide compensation, monetary payments, or other 
        assistance to civilians who incur harm due directly or 
        indirectly to the combat activities of the United States Armed 
        Forces.
            (2) A description of the practices in effect as of the date 
        of enactment of this Act for the United States to provide ex 
        gratia, solatia, or other types of condolence payments to 
        civilians who incur harm due directly or indirectly to the 
        combat activities of the United States Armed Forces.
            (3) A discussion of the historic practice of the United 
        States to provide compensation, other monetary payments, or 
        other assistance to civilian foreign nationals who incur harm 
        due directly or indirectly to combat activities of the United 
        States Armed Forces.
            (4) A discussion of the practice of the United States in 
        Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom to 
        provide compensation, other monetary payments, or other 
        assistance to civilian foreign nationals who incur harm due 
        directly or indirectly to the combat activities of the United 
        States Armed Forces, including the procedures and guidelines 
        used and an assessment of its effectiveness. This discussion 
        will also include estimates of the total amount of funds 
        disbursed to civilian foreign nationals who have incurred harm 
        since the inception of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation 
        Enduring Freedom. This discussion will also include how such 
        procedures and guidelines compare to the processing of claims 
        filed under the Foreign Claims Act.
            (5) A discussion of the positive and negative effects of 
        using different authorities, procedure, and guidelines to 
        provide monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals, 
        based upon the culture and economic circumstances of the local 
        populace and the operational impact on the military mission. 
        This discussion will also include whether the use of different 
        authorities, procedures, and guidelines has resulted in 
        disparate monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals who 
        have incurred substantially similar harm, and if so, the 
        frequency and effect of such results.
            (6) A discussion of the positive and negative effects of 
        establishing general uniform procedures and guidelines for the 
        provision of such assistance, based upon the goals of timely 
        commencement of a program of monetary assistance, efficient and 
        effective implementation of such program, and consistency in 
        the amount of assistance in relation to the harm incurred. This 
        discussion will also include whether the implementation of 
        general procedures and guidelines would create a legally 
        enforceable entitlement to ``compensation'' and, if so, any 
        potential significant operational impact arising from such an 
        entitlement.
            (7) Assuming general uniform procedures and guidelines were 
        to be established, a discussion of the following:
                    (A) Whether such assistance should be limited to 
                specified types of combat activities or operations, 
                e.g., such as during counterinsurgency operations.
                    (B) Whether such assistance should be contingent 
                upon a formal determination that a particular combat 
                activity/operation is a qualifying activity, and the 
                criteria, if any, for such a determination.
                    (C) Whether a time limit from the date of loss for 
                providing such assistance should be prescribed.
                    (D) Whether only monetary or other types of 
                assistance should be authorized, and what types of 
                nonmonetary assistance, if any, should be authorized.
                    (E) Whether monetary value limits should be placed 
                on the assistance that may be provided, or whether the 
                determination to provide assistance and, if so, the 
                monetary value of such assistance, should be based, in 
                whole or in part, on a legal advisor's assessment of 
                the facts.
                    (F) Whether a written record of the determination 
                to provide or to not provide such assistance should be 
                maintained and a copy made available to the civilian 
                foreign national.
                    (G) Whether in the event of a determination to not 
                provide such assistance the civilian foreign national 
                should be afforded the option of a review of the 
                determination by a higher ranking authority.
    (c) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall include in the report 
such recommendations as the Secretary considers appropriate for 
legislative or administrative action with respect to the matters 
discussed in the report.

than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. The report 
shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
annex.

SEC. 2705. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NEED FOR COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE RELATED 
              TO BASE CLOSURES AND REALIGNMENTS AND FORCE 
              REPOSITIONING.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The 2005 round of defense base closures and 
        realignments (BRAC) has resulted in a requirement to dispose of 
        excess Federal property in addition to property determined to 
        be excess as the result of decisions in four previous rounds of 
        base realignments and closures in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995.
            (2) The Department of Defense has primary responsibility to 
        dispose of Federal property resulting from the closure or 
        realignment of military installations under the Defense Base 
        Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of 
        Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).
            (3) The Department of Defense is authorized to dispose of 
        BRAC property using a range of methods including administrative 
        transfer to another Federal agency, public benefit conveyances, 
        homeless housing assistance, economic development conveyances, 
        negotiated sales, or public sales.
            (4) The Department of Defense is authorized to convey 
        property to local redevelopment agencies representing 
        communities affected by base closures and realignments for the 
        purpose of economic development.
            (5) The Department of Defense is authorized to assess the 
        needs of the local community and the intended use of the 
        property in determining the amount of compensation to be 
        received in exchange for the economic development conveyance.
            (6) The Department of Defense is authorized to receive an 
        amount for the economic development conveyance that may range 
        from fair market value to an amount less than fair market, to 
        no cost to the conveyee, depending on the local economic 
        conditions.
            (7) The Department of Defense is required to use any 
        monetary proceeds gained from the disposal of BRAC property to 
        fund environmental clean-up, remediation, and compliance 
        actions required to safely dispose of BRAC property.
            (8) Any revenue foregone as a result of a decision not to 
        seek fair market value for disposed property must be 
        compensated with appropriated funds requested by the Department 
        of Defense in annual budget submissions to Congress.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that, as 
the Federal Government implements base closures and realignments, 
global repositioning, and grow the force initiatives, it is necessary--
            (1) to assist local communities coping with the impact of 
        these programs at both closed and active military 
        installations; and
            (2) to comprehensively assess the needs and degree of 
        Federal assistance to communities to effectively implement the 
        various initiatives of the Department of Defense while aiding 
        communities to either recover quickly from closures or to 
        accommodate growth associated with troop influxes.

SEC. 3138. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRODUCTION OF MOLYBDENUM-99.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) There are fewer than five reactors around the world 
        currently capable of producing molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) and there 
        are no such reactors in the United States that can provide a 
        reliable supply of Mo-99 to meet medical needs.
            (2) Since November 2007, there have been major disruptions 
        in the global availability of Mo-99, including at facilities in 
        Canada and the Netherlands, which have led to shortages of Mo-
        99-based medical products in the United States and around the 
        world.
            (3) Ensuring a reliable supply of medical radioisotopes, 
        including Mo-99, is of great importance to the public health.
            (4) It is also a national security priority of the United 
        States, and specifically of the Department of Energy, to 
        encourage the production of low-enriched uranium-based 
        radioisotopes in order to promote a more peaceful international 
        nuclear order.
            (5) The National Academy of Sciences has identified a need 
        to establish a reliable capability in the United States for the 
        production of Mo-99 and its derivatives for medical purposes 
        using low-enriched uranium.
            (6) There also exists a capable industrial base in the 
        United States that can support the development of Mo-99 
        production facilities and can conduct the processing and 
        distribution of radiopharmaceutical products for use in medical 
        tests worldwide.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, including Mo-99 
        and its derivatives, are essential components of medical tests 
        that help diagnose and treat life-threatening diseases 
        affecting millions of people each year; and
            (2) the Secretary of Energy should continue and expand a 
        program to meet the need identified by the National Academy of 
        Sciences to ensure a source of Mo-99 and its derivatives for 
        use in medical tests to help ensure the health security of the 
        United States and around the world and promote peaceful nuclear 
        industries through the use of low-enriched uranium.

                 TITLE XXXIII--MARITIME ADMINISTRATION

SEC. 3301. MARITIME ADMINISTRATION.

    Section 109 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to read as 
follows:
``Sec. 109. Maritime Administration
    ``(a) Organization.--The Maritime Administration is an 
administration in the Department of Transportation.
    ``(b) Maritime Administrator.--The head of the Maritime 
Administration is the Maritime Administrator, who is appointed by the 
President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The 
Administrator shall report directly to the Secretary of Transportation 
and carry out the duties prescribed by the Secretary.
    ``(c) Deputy Maritime Administrator.--The Maritime Administrator 
shall have a Deputy Maritime Administrator, who is appointed in the 
competitive service by the Secretary, after consultation with the 
Administrator. The Deputy Administrator shall carry out the duties 
prescribed by the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator shall be 
Acting Administrator during the absence or disability of the 
Administrator and, unless the Secretary designates another individual, 
during a vacancy in the office of Administrator.
    ``(d) Duties and Powers Vested in Secretary.--All duties and powers 
of the Maritime Administration are vested in the Secretary.
    ``(e) Regional Offices.--The Maritime Administration shall have 
regional offices for the Atlantic, Gulf, Great Lakes, and Pacific port

securing preference to vessels of the United States for the 
transportation of those commodities.
    ``(g) Detailing Officers From Armed Forces.--To assist the 
Secretary in carrying out duties and powers relating to the Maritime 
Administration, not more than five officers of the armed forces may be 
detailed to the Secretary at any one time, in addition to details 
authorized by any other law. During the period of a detail, the 
Secretary shall pay the officer an amount that, when added to the 
officer's pay and allowances as an officer in the armed forces, make 
the officer's total pay and allowances equal to the amount that would 
be paid to an individual performing work the Secretary considers to be 
of similar importance, difficulty, and responsibility as that performed 
by the officer during the detail.
    ``(h) Contracts and Audits.--
            ``(1) Contracts.--In the same manner that a private 
        corporation may make a contract within the scope of its 
        authority under its charter, the Secretary may make contracts 
        for the United States Government and disburse amounts to--
                    ``(A) carry out the Secretary's duties and powers 
                under this section and subtitle V of title 46; and
                    ``(B) protect, preserve, and improve collateral 
                held by the Secretary to secure indebtedness.
            ``(2) Audits.--The financial transactions of the Secretary 
        under paragraph (1) shall be audited by the Comptroller 
        General. The Comptroller General shall allow credit for an 
        expenditure shown to be necessary because of the nature of the 
        business activities authorized by this section or subtitle V of 
        title 46. At least once a year, the Comptroller General shall 
        report to Congress any departure by the Secretary from this 
        section or subtitle V of title 46.
    ``(i) Authorization of Appropriations.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this 
        subsection, there are authorized to be appropriated such 
        amounts as may be necessary to carry out the duties and powers 
        of the Secretary relating to the Maritime Administration.
            ``(2) Limitations.--Only those amounts specifically 
        authorized by law may be appropriated for the use of the

                    ``(B) construction-differential subsidies incident 
                to the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning 
                of vessels;
                    ``(C) costs of national defense features;
                    ``(D) payments of obligations incurred for 
                operating-differential subsidies;
                    ``(E) expenses necessary for research and 
                development activities, including reimbursement of the 
                Vessel Operations Revolving Fund for losses resulting 
                from expenses of experimental vessel operations;
                    ``(F) the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund;
                    ``(G) National Defense Reserve Fleet expenses;

            ``(3) Training vessels.--Amounts may not be appropriated 
        for the purchase or construction of training vessels for State 
        maritime academies unless the Secretary has approved a plan for 
        sharing training vessels between State maritime academies.''.

         DIVISION E--MATTHEW SHEPARD HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT

SEC. 4701. SHORT TITLE.

    This division may be cited as the ``Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes 
Prevention Act''.

SEC. 4702. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or 
        perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, 
        sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the 
        victim poses a serious national problem.
            (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of 
        communities and is deeply divisive.
            (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue 
        to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of 
        violent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes 
        motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out their 
        responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal 
        assistance.
            (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this 
        problem.
            (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated 
        by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and 
        the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages 
        the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be 
        selected.
            (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce 
        in many ways, including the following:
                    (A) The movement of members of targeted groups is 
                impeded, and members of such groups are forced to move 
                across State lines to escape the incidence or risk of 
                such violence.
                    (B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from 
                purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining 
                employment, or participating in other commercial 
                activity.
                    (C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such 
                violence.
                    (D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of 
                interstate commerce are used to facilitate the 
                commission of such violence.
                    (E) Such violence is committed using articles that 
                have traveled in interstate commerce.
            (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and 
        involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and 
        ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary 
        servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption 
        of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, 
        through widespread public and private violence directed at 
        persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or perceived 
        race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially 
        motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the 
        extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery 
        and involuntary servitude.
            (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
        amendments to the Constitution of the United States were 
        adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious 
        and national origin groups were and are perceived to be 
        distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent 
        possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is 
        necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of real or 
        perceived religions or national origins, at least to the extent 
        such religions or national origins were regarded as races at 
        the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments 
        to the Constitution of the United States.
            (9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes 
        motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
        to work together as partners in the investigation and 
        prosecution of such crimes.
            (10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
        sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as 
        to warrant Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, 
        and Indian tribes.

SEC. 4703. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.

    In this division--
            (1) the term ``crime of violence'' has the meaning given 
        that term in section 16, title 18, United States Code;
            (2) the term ``hate crime'' has the meaning given such term 
        in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law 
        Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note); and
            (3) the term ``local'' means a county, city, town, 
        township, parish, village, or other general purpose political 
        subdivision of a State.

SEC. 4704. SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS BY 
              STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

    (a) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--
            (1) In general.--At the request of State, local, or tribal 
        law enforcement agency, the Attorney General may provide 
        technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of 
        assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of any 
        crime that--
                    (A) constitutes a crime of violence;
                    (B) constitutes a felony under the State, local, or 
                tribal laws; and
                    (C) is motivated by prejudice based on the actual 
                or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, 
                gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
                disability of the victim, or is a violation of the 
                State, local, or tribal hate crime laws.
            (2) Priority.--In providing assistance under paragraph (1), 
        the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes committed by 
        offenders who have committed crimes in more than one State and 
        to rural jurisdictions that have difficulty covering the 
        extraordinary expenses relating to the investigation or 
        prosecution of the crime.
    (b) Grants.--
            (1) In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to 
        State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies for 
        extraordinary expenses associated with the investigation and 
        prosecution of hate crimes.
            (2) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant 
        program under this subsection, the Office of Justice Programs 
        shall work closely with grantees to ensure that the concerns 
        and needs of all affected parties, including community groups 
        and schools, colleges, and universities, are addressed through 
        the local infrastructure developed under the grants.
            (3) Application.--
                    (A) In general.--Each State, local, and tribal law 
                enforcement agency that desires a grant under this 
                subsection shall submit an application to the Attorney 
                General at such time, in such manner, and accompanied 
                by or containing such information as the Attorney 
                General shall reasonably require.

SEC. 6013. EXPANSION OF THE MARINE VIEW SYSTEM.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Marine transportation system.--The term ``marine 
        transportation system'' means the navigable water 
        transportation system of the United States, including the 
        vessels, ports (and intermodal connections thereto), and 
        shipyards and other vessel repair facilities that are 
        components of that system.
            (2) Marine view system.--The term ``Marine View system'' 
        means the information system of the Maritime Administration 
        known as Marine View.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Information regarding the marine transportation system 
        is comprised of information from the Government of the United 
        States and from commercial sources.
            (2) Marine transportation system information includes 
        information regarding waterways, bridges, locks, dams, and all 
        intermodal components that are dependent on maritime 
        transportation and accurate information regarding marine 
        transportation is critical to the health of the United States 
        economy.
            (3) Numerous challenges face the marine transportation 
        system, including projected growth in cargo volumes, 
        international competition, complexity, cooperation, and the 
        need for improved efficiency.
            (4) There are deficiencies in the current information 
        environment of the marine transportation system, including the 
        inability to model the entire marine transportation system to 
        address capacity planning, disaster planning, and disaster 
        recovery.
            (5) The current information environment of the marine 
        transportation system contains multiple unique systems that are 
        duplicative, not integrated, not able to be shared, not secure, 
        or that have little structured privacy protections, not 
        protected from loss or destruction, and will not be available 
        when needed.
            (6) There is a lack of system-wide information views in the 
        marine transportation system.
            (7) The Administrator of the Maritime Administration is 
        uniquely positioned to develop and execute the role of marine 
        transportation system information advocate, to serve as the 
        focal point for marine transportation system information 
        management, and to provide a robust information infrastructure 
        to identify, collect, secure, protect, store, and deliver 
        critical information regarding the marine transportation 
        system.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to expand the Marine View system; and
            (2) to provide support for the strategic requirements of 
        the marine transportation system and its contribution to the 
        economic viability of the United States.
    (d) Expansion of Marine View System.--To accomplish the purposes of 
this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall expand the Marine 
View system so that such system is able to identify, collect, 
integrate, secure, protect, store, and securely distribute throughout 
the marine transportation system information that--
            (1) provides access to many disparate marine transportation 
        system data sources;
            (2) enables a system-wide view of the marine transportation 
        system;
            (3) fosters partnerships between the Government of the 
        United States and private entities;
            (4) facilitates accurate and efficient modeling of the 
        entire marine transportation system environment;
            (5) monitors and tracks threats to the marine 
        transportation system, including areas of severe weather or 
        reported piracy; and
            (6) provides vessel tracking and rerouting, as appropriate, 
        to ensure that the economic viability of the United States 
        waterways is maintained.
    (e) Agreements and Contracts.--The Administrator of the Maritime 
Administration may enter into cooperative agreements, partnerships, 
contracts, or other agreements with industry or other Federal agencies 
to carry out this section.
