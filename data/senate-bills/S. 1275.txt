            (1) many of the Nation's urban, rural, and Native American 
        communities face critical social and economic problems arising 
        in part from the lack of economic growth, people living in 
        poverty, and the lack of employment and other opportunities;
            (2) the restoration and maintenance of the economies of 
        these communities will require coordinated development 
        strategies, intensive supportive services, and increased access 
        to equity investments and loans for development activities, 
        including investment in businesses, housing, commercial real 
        estate, human development, and other activities that promote 
        the long-term economic and social viability of the community; 
        and
            (3) community development financial institutions have 
        proven their ability to identify and respond to community needs 
        for equity investments, loans, and development services.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to create a Community 
Development Financial Institutions Fund that will promote economic 
revitalization and community development through a program of 
investment in and assistance to community development financial 
institutions, including enhancing the liquidity of community 
development financial institutions.

    ``(a) Disclosures.--
            ``(1) Specific disclosures.--In addition to other 
        disclosures required under this title, for each high cost 
        mortgage, the creditor shall provide the following disclosures 
        in conspicuous type size:
                    ``(A) `You are not required to complete this 
                agreement merely because you have received these 
                disclosures or have signed a loan application.'
                    ``(B) `If you obtain this loan, the lender will 
                have a mortgage on your home. You could lose your home, 
                and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet 
                your obligations under the loan.'.
            ``(2) Annual percentage rate.--In addition to the 
        disclosures required under paragraph (1), the creditor shall 
        disclose--
                    ``(A) the annual percentage rate of the loan and 
                the amount of the regular monthly payment; or
                    ``(B) in the case of a variable rate loan, the 
                annual percentage rate of the loan, a statement that 
                the interest rate and monthly payment may increase, and 
                the amount of the maximum possible monthly payment.
    ``(b) Time of Disclosures.--
            ``(1) In general.--The disclosures required by this section 
        shall be given not less than 3 business days prior to 
        consummation of the transaction.
            ``(2) New disclosures required.--After providing the 
        disclosures required by this section, a creditor may not change 
        the terms of the loan if such changes make the disclosures 
        inaccurate, unless new disclosures are provided that meet the 
        requirements of this section.
            ``(3) Modifications.--The Board may, if it finds that such 
        action is necessary to permit homeowners to meet bona fide 
        personal financial emergencies, prescribe regulations 
        authorizing the modification or waiver of rights created under 
        this subsection, to the extent and under the circumstances set 
        forth in those regulations.
    ``(c) No Prepayment Penalty.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (4), a 
        high cost mortgage may not contain terms under which a consumer 
        must pay a prepayment penalty for paying all or part of the 
        principal of the loan prior to the date on which such principal 
        is due. If the date of maturity of the high cost mortgage is 
        accelerated for any reason, and the consumer is entitled to a 
        rebate of interest, computation of the rebate amount shall 
        comply with paragraph (2). No high cost mortgage shall provide 
        for a default interest rate that is higher than the interest 
        rate provided by the note for the loan prior to default.
            ``(2) Rebate computation.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        any method of computing rebates of interest that is less 
        favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method (as defined 
        in section 933 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 
        1992) using simple interest is a prepayment penalty.
            ``(3) Certain other fees prohibited.--An agreement to 
        refinance a high cost mortgage by the same creditor or an 
        affiliate of the creditor may not require the consumer to pay 
        points, discount fees, or prepaid finance charges on the 
        portion of the loan refinanced.
            ``(4) Exception.--A high cost mortgage may include terms 
        under which a consumer is required to pay not more than 1 
        month's interest as a penalty if the consumer prepays the 
        principal of the loan within 90 days of origination.
    ``(d) No Balloon Payments.--A high cost mortgage may not include 
terms under which the aggregate amount of the regular periodic payments 
would not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance.
    ``(e) No Negative Amortization.--A high cost mortgage may not 
include terms under which the outstanding principal balance will 
increase at any time over the course of the loan because the regular 
periodic payments do not cover the full amount of interest due.
    ``(f) No Prepaid Payments.--A high cost mortgage may not include 
terms under which more than 2 periodic payments required under the loan 
are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to 
the consumer.
    ``(g) Consequence of Failure To Comply.--Any high cost mortgage 
loan that contains a provision prohibited by this section shall be 
deemed a failure to deliver the material disclosures required under 
this title, for the purpose of section 125.
    ``(h) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term 
`affiliate' has the same meaning as in section 2(k) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956.
    ``(i) Discretionary Regulatory Authority of Board.--
            ``(1) Exemptions.--The Board may, by regulation or order, 
        exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages 
        from any or all of the prohibitions specified in subsections 
        (c) through (f), if the Board finds that the exemption--
                    ``(A) is in the interest of the borrowing public; 
                and
                    ``(B) will apply only to products that maintain and 
                strengthen home ownership and equity protection.
            ``(2) Prohibitions.--The Board, by regulation or order, 
        shall prohibit any specific acts or practices in connection 
        with high cost mortgages that the Board finds to be unfair, 
        deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of this 
        section.''.

        requirement under section 129, an amount equal to the sum of

transactions involving small business related securities (as defined in

             Subtitle B--Small Business Capital Enhancement

SEC. 251. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) small business concerns are a vital part of the 
        economy, accounting for the majority of new jobs, new products, 
        and new services created in the United States;
            (2) adequate access to debt capital is a critical component 
        for small business development, productivity, expansion, and 
        success in the United States;
            (3) commercial banks are the most important suppliers of 
        debt capital to small business concerns in the United States;
            (4) commercial banks and other depository institutions have 
        various incentives to minimize their risk in financing small 
        business concerns;
            (5) as a result of such incentives, many small business 
        concerns with economically sound financing needs are unable to 
        obtain access to needed debt capital;
            (6) the small business capital access programs implemented 
        by certain States are a flexible and efficient tool to assist 
        financial institutions in providing access to needed debt 
        capital for many small business concerns in a manner consistent 
        with safety and soundness regulations;
            (7) a small business capital access program would 
        complement other programs which assist small business concerns 
        in obtaining access to capital; and
            (8) Federal policy can stimulate and accelerate efforts by 
        States to implement small business capital access programs by 
        providing an incentive to States, while leaving the 
        administration of such programs to each participating State.
    (b) Purposes.--By encouraging States to implement administratively 
efficient capital access programs that encourage commercial banks and 
other depository institutions to provide access to debt capital for a 
broad portfolio of small business concerns, and thereby promote a more 
efficient and effective debt market, the purposes of this subtitle 
are--
            (1) to promote economic opportunity and growth;
            (2) to create jobs;
            (3) to promote economic efficiency;
            (4) to enhance productivity; and
            (5) to spur innovation.

        legally committed to contributions by the State to reserve 
        funds, with such funds being available without time limit and 
        without requiring additional legal action, except that such

        the State to take action at a later time that results in the 
        termination of its obligation to enroll loans and make 
        contributions to reserve funds;
            (4) the State has prescribed a form of participation 
        agreement to be entered into between it and each participating

    (c) Existing State Programs.--
            (1) In general.--A State that is not a participating State, 
        but that has its own capital access program providing portfolio 
        insurance for business loans (based on a separate loss reserve 
        fund for each financial institution), may apply at any time to

                participation agreement that conforms with section 255 
                is required in order to secure participation approval 
                by the Secretary, contributions subject to

appropriations Act), without fiscal year limitation, for the purpose of 
making reimbursements pursuant to section 257.
    (e) Amendments to Agreements.--If a State that has been approved to 
be a participating State wishes to amend its form of participation 
agreement and continue to be a participating State, such State shall 
submit such amendment for review by the Secretary in accordance with 
subsection (b)(4). Any such amendment shall become effective only after 
it has been approved by the Secretary.

SEC. 254. PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--A participating State may enter into a 
participation agreement with any financial institution determined by 
the participating State, after consultation with the appropriate 
Federal banking agency, to have sufficient commercial lending 
experience and financial and managerial capacity to participate in the 
Program. The determination by the State shall not be reviewable by the 
Secretary.
    (b) Participating Financial Institutions.--Upon entering into the 
participation agreement with the participating State, the financial 
institution shall become a participating financial institution eligible 
to enroll loans under the Program.

SEC. 255. TERMS OF PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--The participation agreement to be entered into by 
a participating State and a participating financial institution shall 
include all provisions required by this section, and shall not include 
any provisions inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
    (b) Establishment of Separate Reserve Funds.--A separate reserve 
fund shall be established by the participating State for each 
participating financial institution. All funds credited to a reserve 
fund shall be subject to the control of the participating State. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the participating State may 
allow a participating financial institution to treat the premium 
charges paid by the institution and the borrower into the reserve fund, 
and interest earned thereon, as assets of the institution for 
accounting purposes. Each reserve fund shall be an administrative 
account for the purposes of--
            (1) receiving all required premium charges to be paid by 
        the borrower and participating financial institution and 
        contributions by the participating State; and
            (2) disbursing funds, either to cover losses sustained by 
        the participating financial institution in connection with 
        loans made under the Program, or as contemplated by subsections 
        (d) and (r).
    (c) Investment Authority.--Subject to applicable State law, the 
participating State may invest, or cause to be invested, funds held in 
a reserve fund by establishing a deposit account at the participating 
financial institution in the name of the participating State. In the 
event that funds in the reserve fund are not deposited in such an 
account, such funds shall be invested in a form that the participating 
State determines is safe and liquid.
    (d) Earned Income and Interest.--Interest or income earned on the 
funds credited to a reserve fund shall be deemed to be part of the 
reserve fund, except that a participating State may, as further 
specified in the participation agreement--
            (1) provide authority for the participating State to 
        withdraw some or all of such interest or income earned; and
            (2) allow the participating financial institution, upon its 
        withdrawal from the Program, to withdraw interest or income 
        earned that is deemed to be attributable to the premium charges 
        paid by the institution and the borrower and that remains in 
        the reserve fund, if such withdrawal does not expose the 
        participating State to any greater risk of loss than the risk 
        of loss in the absence of such withdrawal.
    (e) Loan Terms and Conditions.--
            (1) In general.--A loan to be filed for enrollment under 
        the Program may be made with such interest rate, fees, and 
        other terms and conditions as agreed upon by the participating 
        financial institution and the borrower, consistent with 
        applicable law.
            (2) Lines of credit.--If a loan to be filed for enrollment 
        is in the form of a line of credit, the amount of the loan 
        shall be considered to be the maximum amount that can be drawn 
        by the borrower against the line of credit.
    (f) Enrollment Process.--
            (1) Filing.--
                    (A) In general.--A participating financial 
                institution shall file each loan made under the Program 
                for enrollment by completing and submitting to the 
                participating State a form prescribed by the 
                participating State.
                    (B) Form.--The form referred to in subparagraph (A) 
                shall include a representation by the participating 
                financial institution that it has complied with the 
                participation agreement in enrolling the loan with the 
                State.
                    (C) Premium charges.--Accompanying the completed 
                form shall be the nonrefundable premium charges paid by 
                the borrower and the participating financial 
                institution, or evidence that such premium charges have 
                been deposited into the deposit account containing the 
                reserve fund, if applicable.
                    (D) Submission.--The participation agreement shall 
                require that the items required by this subsection 
                shall be submitted to the participating State by the 
                participating financial institutions not later than 10 
                calendar days after a loan is made.
            (2) Enrollment by state.--Upon receipt by the participating 
        State of the filing submitted in accordance with paragraph (1), 
        the participating State shall promptly enroll the loan and make 
        a matching contribution to the reserve fund in accordance with 
        subsection (j), unless the information submitted indicates that 
        the participating financial institution has not complied with 
        the participation agreement in enrolling the loan.
    (g) Coverage Amount.--In filing a loan for enrollment under the 
Program, the participating financial institution may specify an amount 
to be covered under the Program that is less than the full amount of 
the loan.
    (h) Premium Charges.--
            (1) Minimum and maximum amounts.--The premium charges 
        payable to the reserve fund by the borrower and the 
        participating financial institution shall be prescribed by the 
        participating financial institution, within minimum and maximum 
        limits set forth in the participation agreement. The 
        participation agreement shall establish minimum and maximum 
        limits whereby the sum of the premium charges paid in 
        connection with a loan by the borrower and the participating 
        financial institution is not less than 3 percent nor more than 
        7 percent of the amount of the loan covered under the Program.
            (2) Allocation of premium charges.--The participation 
        agreement shall specify terms for allocating premium charges 
        between the borrower and the participating financial 
        institution. However, if the participating financial 
        institution is required to pay any of the premium charges, the 
        participation agreement shall authorize the participating 
        financial institution to recover from the borrower the cost of 
        the payment of the participating financial institution, in any 
        manner on which the participating financial institution and the 
        borrower agree.
    (i) Restrictions.--
            (1) Actions prohibited.--Except as provided in subsection 
        (h) and paragraph (2) of this subsection, the participating 
        State may not--
                    (A) impose any restrictions or requirements, 
                relating to the interest rate, fees, collateral, or 
                other business terms and conditions of the loan; or
                    (B) condition enrollment of a loan in the Program 
                on the review by the State of the risk or 
                creditworthiness of a loan.
            (2) Effect on other law.--Nothing in this subtitle shall 
        affect the applicability of any other law to the conduct by a 
        participating financial institution of its business.
    (j) State Contributions.--In enrolling a loan under the Program, 
the participating State shall contribute to the reserve fund an amount, 
as provided for in the participation agreement, which shall not be less 
than the sum of the amount of premium charges paid by the borrower and 
the participating financial institution.
    (k) Elements of Claims.--
            (1) Filing.--If a participating financial institution 
        charges off all or part of an enrolled loan, such participating 
        financial institution may file a claim for reimbursement with 
        the participating State by submitting a form that--
                    (A) includes the representation by the 
                participating financial institution that it is filing 
                the claim in accordance with the terms of the 
                applicable participation agreement; and
                    (B) contains such other information as may be 
                required by the participating State.
            (2) Timing.--Any claim filed under paragraph (1) shall be 
        filed contemporaneously with the action of the participating 
        financial institution to charge off all or part of an enrolled 
        loan. The participating financial institution shall determine 
        when and how much to charge off on an enrolled loan, in a 
        manner consistent with its usual method for making such 
        determinations on business loans that are not enrolled loans 
        under this subtitle.
    (l) Elements of Claims.--A claim filed by a participating financial 
institution may include the amount of principal charged off, not to 
exceed the covered amount of the loan. Such claim may also include 
accrued interest and out-of-pocket expenses, if and to the extent 
provided for under the participation agreement.
    (m) Payment of Claims.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (n) and 
        paragraph (2) of this subsection, upon receipt of a claim filed 
        in accordance with this section and the participation 
        agreement, the participating State shall promptly pay to the 
        participating financial institution, from funds in the reserve 
        fund, the full amount of the claim as submitted.
            (2) Insufficient reserve funds.--If there are insufficient 
        funds in the reserve fund to cover the entire amount of a claim 
        of a participating financial institution, the participating 
        State shall pay to the participating financial institution an 
        amount equal to the current balance in the reserve fund. If the 
        enrolled loan for which the claim has been filed--
                    (A) is not an early loan, such payment shall be 
                deemed fully to satisfy the claim, and the 
                participating financial institution shall have no other 
                or further right to receive any amount from the reserve 
                fund with respect to such claim; or
                    (B) is an early loan, such payment shall not be 
                deemed fully to satisfy the claim of the participating 
                financial institution, and at such time as the 
                remaining balance of the claim does not exceed 75 
                percent of the balance in the reserve fund, the 
                participating State shall, upon the request of the 
                participating financial institution, pay any remaining 
                amount of the claim.
    (n) Denial of Claims.--A participating State may deny a claim if a 
representation or warranty made by the participating financial 
institution to the participating State at the time that the loan was 
filed for enrollment or at the time that the claim was submitted was 
known by the participating financial institution to be false.
    (o) Subsequent Recovery of Claim Amount.--If, subsequent to payment 
of a claim by the participating State, a participating financial 
institution recovers from a borrower any amount for which payment of 
the claim was made, the participating financial institution shall 
promptly pay to the participating State for deposit into the reserve 
fund the amount recovered, less any expenses incurred by the 
institution in collection of such amount.
    (p) Participation Agreement Terms.--
            (1) In general.--In connection with the filing of a loan 
        for enrollment in the Program, the participation agreement--
                    (A) shall require the participating financial 
                institution to obtain an assurance from each borrower 
                that--
                            (i) the proceeds of the loan will be used 
                        for a business purpose;
                            (ii) the loan will not be used to finance 
                        passive real estate ownership; and
                            (iii) the borrower is not--
                                    (I) an executive officer, director, 
                                or principal shareholder of the 
                                participating financial institution;
                                    (II) a member of the immediate 
                                family of an executive officer, 
                                director, or principal shareholder of 
                                the participating financial 
                                institution; or
                                    (III) a related interest of any 
                                such executive officer, director, 
                                principal shareholder, or member of the 
                                immediate family;
                    (B) shall require the participating financial 
                institution to provide assurances to the participating 
                State that the loan has not been made in order to place 
                under the protection of the Program prior debt that is 
                not covered under the Program and that is or was owed 
                by the borrower to the participating financial 
                institution or to an affiliate of the participating 
                financial institution;
                    (C) may provide that if--
                            (i) a participating financial institution 
                        makes a loan to a borrower that is a 
                        refinancing of a loan previously made to the 
                        borrower by the participating financial 
                        institution or an affiliate of the 
                        participating financial institution;
                            (ii) such prior loan was not enrolled in 
                        the Program; and
                            (iii) additional or new financing is 
                        extended by the participating financial 
                        institution as part of the refinancing,
                the participating financial institution may file the 
                loan for enrollment, with the amount to be covered 
                under the Program not to exceed the amount of any 
                additional or new financing; and
                    (D) may include additional restrictions on the 
                eligibility of loans or borrowers that are not 
                inconsistent with the provisions and purposes of this 
                subtitle.
            (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the 
        terms ``executive officer'', ``director'', ``principal 
        shareholder'', ``immediate family'', and ``related interest'' 
        refer to the same relationship to a participating financial 
        institution as the relationship described in part 215 of title 
        12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor to such 
        part.
    (q) Termination Clause.--In each participation agreement, the 
participating State shall reserve for itself the ability to terminate 
its obligation to enroll loans under the Program. Any such termination 
shall be prospective only, and shall not apply to amounts of loans 
enrolled under the Program prior to such termination.
    (r) Allowable Withdrawals From Fund.--
            (1) Withdrawals based on outstanding balance.--The 
        participation agreement may provide that, if, for any 
        consecutive period of not less than 24 months, the aggregate 
        outstanding balance of all enrolled loans for a participating 
        financial institution is continually less than the outstanding 
        balance in the reserve fund for that participating financial 
        institution, the participating State, in its discretion, may 
        withdraw an amount from the reserve fund to bring the balance 
        in the reserve fund down to the outstanding balance of all such 
        enrolled loans.
            (2) Withdrawals based on premium charges remaining in 
        fund.--Upon its withdrawal from the Program, a participating 
        financial institution may withdraw from the reserve fund an 
        amount that is equivalent to the premium charges paid into the 
        fund by the institution and the borrower that remain in the 
        reserve fund, if such withdrawal would not expose the 
        participating State to a greater risk of loss than the risk of 
        loss in the absence of such withdrawal.

shall reimburse the participating State in an amount equal to 50 
percent of the amount of contributions by the participating State to 
the reserve funds that are subject to reimbursement by the Secretary

by the Secretary to a participating State over any 3-year period in 
connection with loans made to any single borrower or any group of

have the same meaning as in part 32 of title 12 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, or any successor to that part.
    (d) Loans Totaling Less Than $2,000,000.--In connection with a loan 
in which the covered amount of the loan plus the covered amount of all

the participating State shall not exceed the lesser of--
            (1) 75 percent of the sum of the premium charges paid to 
        the reserve fund by the borrower and the participating 
        financial institution; or
            (2) 5.25 percent of the covered amount of the loan.

            (2) 3.5 percent of the covered amount of the loan.

        which when added to the aggregate covered amount of all 
        previously enrolled loans equals $2,000,000; and
            (2) by applying subsection (e) to the balance of the loan.

SEC. 258. REIMBURSEMENT TO THE SECRETARY.

    (a) In General.--If a participating State withdraws funds from a 
reserve fund pursuant to terms of the participation agreement permitted 
by subsection (d) or (r) of section 255, such participating State 
shall, not later than 15 calendar days after such withdrawal, submit to 
the Secretary an amount computed by multiplying the amount withdrawn by 
the appropriate factor, as determined under subsection (b).
