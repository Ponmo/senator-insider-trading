  Corporation and distributed to each grantee funded in fiscal year 1993
  pursuant to the number of poor people determined by the Bureau of the
  Census to be within its geographical area shall be distributed in the

  (2) any increase in funding above the fiscal year 1992 level for grants
  and contracts under section 1006(a)(1) shall be awarded to grantees and
  contractors funded at the lowest levels per poor person (calculated for
  each grantee or contractor by dividing each such grantee's or contractor's
  fiscal year 1992 annual grant level by the number of poor persons within
  its geographical area under the 1990 census) so as to fund the largest
  number of programs possible at an equal per-poor-person amount; or

  migrant programs under section 1006(a)(1) shall be awarded on a per migrant
  (including dependents) basis (calculated for each grantee or contractor by
  dividing each such grantee's or contractor's fiscal year 1992 grant level
  by the number of migrants, including dependents, within that grantee's or
  contractor's state as determined by the 1992 Report of the Tomas Rivera
  Center migrant enumeration project) and distributed in the following order:

  and dependent shall be increased by an equal percentage of the amount by
  which such grantee's funding, including the increases under (i) above,
  falls below $19.09 per migrant and dependent, within its state; and
  (iii) twenty percent on an equal migrant and dependent basis to all migrant
  grantees and contractors funded below $19.09 per migrant and dependent
  within its state:
Provided, That if the fiscal year 1993 appropriation falls below the level
necessary to maintain grants and contracts awarded under Section 1006(a)(1)
at the fiscal year 1992 grant levels, funds provided to each grantee or
contractor shall be reduced by a proportionate amount.
  (b) None of the funds appropriated under this Act to the Legal Services
  Corporation shall be expended for any purpose prohibited or limited by or
  contrary to any of the provisions of--
  (1) Section 607 of Public Law 101-515, and that, except for the funding

  (b) and incorporates the requirements of subsection (c) into such final
  rule or order.
  (b) The Commission shall not issue a final rule or order in the proceeding
  identified as ET Docket 92-9, or any successor proceeding, until it has
  received a report from the Secretary of Commerce that also has been
  submitted to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
  of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
  Representatives, which analyzes the feasibility of allowing frequencies
  reserved for use by the Federal Government as of June 1, 1992, to be used
  by emerging telecommunications technology entities, or by any qualified
  private fixed microwave entity now operating on frequencies between 1850
  and 2200 MHz. A final rule or order in the proceeding identified as ET
  Docket 92-9, or any successor proceeding, shall not take effect until 90

  entity whose license was issued at an earlier date than the license for
  such newly licensed system or such modification or addition. Any grant
  of a license for a new system, or for modification of or addition to an
  existing system, of a qualified private fixed microwave entity operating
  or seeking to operate on frequencies between 1850 and 2200 MHz, shall
  be granted on a primary basis, unless no other qualified private fixed
  microwave entity is operating on those frequencies on a primary basis.
  (D) The Commission shall not deny any application for a license for a new
  system, or for modification of or addition to an existing system, of a
  qualified private fixed microwave entity operating or seeking to operate on
  frequencies between 1850 and 2200 MHz, for the purpose of preserving the
  availability of frequencies for emerging telecommunications technologies
  or other uses.
  (2) The Commission shall not impede or restrict the ability of qualified
  private fixed microwave entities operating on frequencies between 1850 and
  2200 MHz, or of licensees or proponents of emerging telecommunications
  technologies, to enter into voluntary agreements for the purpose of
  optimizing efficient use of spectrum, including but not limited to migration
  of facilities to other frequencies or media.

  to binding arbitration under this paragraph a proposal for migration of
  any qualified private fixed microwave entity's facilities operating on
  frequencies between 1850 and 2200 MHz to other frequencies or media; and
  (ii) any qualified private fixed microwave entity operating or seeking to
  operate on frequencies between 1850 and 2200 MHz may submit to binding
  arbitration under this paragraph a proposal for migration to other
  frequencies or media the facilities of any emerging telecommunications
  technology entity operating on frequencies between 1850 and 2200 MHz.
  (B) Any migration proposal under subparagraph (A)(i) or (ii) shall
  demonstrate that--
  (i) an alternative communications system for the party subject to migration
  would be available and would be at lease as reliable in all respects
  as the communications system such party is operating at the time of the
  proposal; and
  (ii) the proponent of such migration will pay all direct and indirect
  costs of such migration.
  (C)(i) Any proposal under subparagraph (A) shall be submitted--
  (I) to an independent arbitrator certified by the American Arbitration
  Association and jointly selected by both parties; or

  would be at least as reliable in all respects as the communications system
  used, at the time of the proposal, by the party subject to migration; and
  (II) the party proposing the migration will pay all direct and indirect
  costs of the proposed migration as such costs are incurred.
  (ii) If the arbitrator does not make the findings described in clause (i),
  the arbitrator shall not approve the proposed migration.
  (iii) The arbitrator shall provide that the party subject to migration
  shall be provided an adequate period of time in which to test the proposed
  alternative communications system and to complete migration.
  (E)(i) The Commission shall implement and enforce the determination of the
  arbitrator made under this paragraph, unless the Commission determines that
  specific acts of fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct by any of
  the parties or the arbitrator materially affected the determination. The
  parties in the proceeding shall be bound by the actions of the Commission
  in implementing and enforcing the determination.
  (ii) If the Commission determines under clause (i) that the arbitrator's
  determination was materially affected by fraud, misrepresentation, or
  other misconduct, the Commission shall resubmit the proposal to a new
  arbitration proceeding under this paragraph.
