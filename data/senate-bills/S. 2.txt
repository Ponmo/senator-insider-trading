                                 A BILL


 
 To extend programs and activities under the Elementary and Secondary 
                         Education Act of 1965.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Educational Opportunities 
Act''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress finds as follows:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) Returning control to parents.--Parents have 
        the primary responsibility for their children's education. 
        Parents are the first and best educators of their children. 
        Congress supports proposals which provide parents greater 
        control to choose new and unique opportunities to meet the 
        educational need of their children.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Supporting exceptional teachers.--Every child 
        should have an exceptional teacher in the classroom. Congress 
        supports rewarding teachers for their successful efforts. 
        Congress also believes in schools being more accountable to 
        parents. Every parent deserves to know if their child is being 
        taught by a teacher who is highly qualified.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Safer and more secure.--Quality instruction 
        and learning can only occur in a first class school that is 
        safe and orderly. No child can learn when schoolyards attract 
        random violence or classrooms are interrupted by disruptive 
        behavior. Congress supports proposals that give schools the 
        tools the schools need to protect teachers and students, remove 
        disruptive influences, and create a positive learning 
        atmosphere.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Dollars to the classroom.--Congress rejects a 
        one-size-fits-all approach to education. America's rural 
        schools often face challenges quite different than their urban 
        counterparts. Congress believes that students should be the 
        primary beneficiaries of educational spending. Congress 
        supports the goal of ensuring that the maximum amount of 
        Federal education dollars are spent directly in the classrooms. 
        State and local communities should have the freedom to tailor 
        their education plans and reforms according to the unique 
        educational needs of their children.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) Basic academics.--Success in education is best 
        achieved when instruction is focused on basic academics and 
        fundamental skills. Students should no longer be subjected to 
        untried and untested educational theories of instruction, 
        rather our Nation's education efforts should be geared to 
        proven methods of instruction.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 3. PURPOSE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    The purpose of this Act is--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) to put our Nation's children first by creating 
        first class schools because nothing is more important to the 
        future of our Nation than the education of its 
        children;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) to give parents and local schools more control 
        over their schools;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) to make our Nation's schools safe and secure, 
        and return to an emphasis on basic academic and quality 
        instruction; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) to support those exceptional teachers who make 
        a difference in the lives of our Nation's children.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    The authorization of appropriations for, and the duration 
of, each program or activity under the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) is extended through 
fiscal year 2004.</DELETED>

        such student to transfer to another public school or public 
        charter school in the same State as the school where the 
        criminal offense occurred, that is selected by the student's

              IMPROVEMENT.

    Section 1116 (20 U.S.C. 6317) is amended--

                under this part to determine whether the school is 
                meeting, or making adequate progress as defined in 
                section 1111(b)(2)(A)(i) toward enabling its students 
                to meet the State's student performance standards

                State's student performance standards.
            ``(2) Local reports.--(A) Following the annual review 
        specified in paragraph (1)(B), each local educational agency

        to prepare or distribute a report regarding such school under 
        this paragraph.'';
            (2) by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
    ``(c) School Improvement.--

        section 1115, a local educational agency may review the 
        progress of only those students in such school who are served 
        under this part.

        date of enactment of the Education Opportunities Act, during 
        which a school did not make adequate yearly progress as defined 
        in the State's plan, as such plan was in effect on the day 
        preceding the date of such enactment.

        days, and at the end of the review period the local educational

        statistical or other substantive reasons, such school may 
        provide evidence to the local educational agency to support 
        such belief.

        counties in their entirety, then each county will be treated as 
        if such county were a separate local educational agency for 
        purposes of calculating grants under this part. The total of

        below the poverty level for counties or local educational 
        agencies, published by the Department of Commerce, unless the 
        Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce determine that use of

        paragraph are inappropriate or unreliable, the Secretary and 
        the Secretary of Commerce shall publicly disclose their 
        reasons. In determining the families which are below the 
        poverty level, the Secretary shall utilize the criteria of 
        poverty used by the Bureau of the Census in compiling the most 
        recent decennial census, in such form as those criteria have 
        been updated by increases in the Consumer Price Index for all 
        urban consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

        receiving an annual income, in excess of the current criteria 
        of poverty, from payments under a State program funded under

        or delinquent children, or being supported in foster homes with 
        public funds, on the basis of the caseload data for the month 
        of October of the preceding fiscal year (using, in the case of 
        children described in the preceding sentence, the criteria of 
        poverty and the form of such criteria required by such sentence

        month of October) or, to the extent that such data are not 
        available to the Secretary before January of the calendar year 
        in which the Secretary's determination is made, then on the

        Health and Human Services shall collect and transmit the 
        information required by this subparagraph to the Secretary not 
        later than January 1 of each year. For the purpose of this 
        section, the Secretary shall consider all children who are in 
        correctional institutions to be living in institutions for 
        delinquent children.

        Secretary of Commerce shall make a special updated estimate of 
        the number of children of such ages who are from families below 
        the poverty level (as determined under paragraph (2)) in each 
        school district, and the Secretary is authorized to pay (either 
        in advance or by way of reimbursement) the Secretary of 
        Commerce the cost of making this special estimate. The 
        Secretary of Commerce shall give consideration to any request 
        of the chief executive of a State for the collection of 
        additional census information. For purposes of this section, 
        the Secretary shall consider all children who are in

agency will use, the State educational agency shall make the excess 
amount available to other local educational agencies in the State that 
need additional funds in accordance with criteria established by the 
State educational agency.

``SEC. 3601. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This part may be cited as the `Access to High Standards Act'.

``SEC. 3602. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) far too many students are not being provided 
        sufficient academic preparation in secondary school, which 
        results in limited employment opportunities, college dropout 
        rates of over 25 percent for the first year of college, and 
        remediation for almost one-third of incoming college freshmen;
            ``(2) there is a growing consensus that raising academic 
        standards, establishing high academic expectations, and showing 
        concrete results are at the core of improving public education;
            ``(3) modeling academic standards on the well-known program 
        of advanced placement courses is an approach that many 
        education leaders and almost half of all States have endorsed;
            ``(4) advanced placement programs already are providing 30 
        different college-level courses, serving almost 60 percent of 
        all secondary schools, reaching over 1,000,000 students (of 
        whom 80 percent attend public schools, 55 percent are females, 
        and 30 percent are minorities), and providing test scores that 
        are accepted for college credit at over 3,000 colleges and 
        universities, every university in Germany, France, and Austria, 
        and most institutions in Canada and the United Kingdom;
            ``(5) 24 States are now funding programs to increase 
        participation in advanced placement programs, including 19 
        States that provide funds for advanced placement teacher 
        professional development, 3 States that require that all public 
        secondary schools offer advanced placement courses, 10 States 
        that pay the fees for advanced placement tests for some or all 
        students, and 4 States that require that their public 
        universities grant uniform academic credit for scores of 3 or 
        better on advanced placement tests; and
            ``(6) the State programs described in paragraph (5) have 
        shown the responsiveness of schools and students to such 
        programs, raised the academic standards for both students 
        participating in such programs and other children taught by 
        teachers who are involved in advanced placement courses, and 
        shown tremendous success in increasing enrollment, achievement, 
        and minority participation in advanced placement programs.
    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are--
            ``(1) to encourage more of the 600,000 students who take 
        advanced placement courses but do not take advanced placement 
        exams each year to demonstrate their achievements through 
        taking the exams;
            ``(2) to build on the many benefits of advanced placement 
        programs for students, which benefits may include the 
        acquisition of skills that are important to many employers, 
        Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores that are 100 points 
        above the national averages, and the achievement of better 
        grades in secondary school and in college than the grades of 
        students who have not participated in the programs;
            ``(3) to support State and local efforts to raise academic 
        standards through advanced placement programs, and thus further 
        increase the number of students who participate and succeed in 
        advanced placement programs;
            ``(4) to increase the availability and broaden the range of 
        schools that have advanced placement programs, which programs 
        are still often distributed unevenly among regions, States, and 
        even secondary schools within the same school district, while 
        also increasing and diversifying student participation in the 
        programs;
            ``(5) to build on the State programs described in 
        subsection (a)(5) and demonstrate that larger and more diverse 
        groups of students can participate and succeed in advanced 
        placement programs;
            ``(6) to provide greater access to advanced placement 
        courses for low-income and other disadvantaged students;
            ``(7) to provide access to advanced placement courses for 
        secondary school juniors at schools that do not offer advanced 
        placement programs, increase the rate of secondary school 
        juniors and seniors who participate in advanced placement 
        courses to 25 percent of the secondary school student 
        population, and increase the numbers of students who receive 
        advanced placement test scores for which college academic 
        credit is awarded; and
            ``(8) to increase the participation of low-income 
        individuals in taking advanced placement tests through the 
        payment or partial payment of the costs of the advanced 
        placement test fees.

              1965.

    Title IV (20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:

         ``TITLE IV--SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES

                         ``PART A--STATE GRANTS

``SEC. 4001. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This part may be cited as the `Safe and Drug-Free Schools and 
Communities Act of 1994'.

``SEC. 4002. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) Every student should attend a school in a drug- and 
        violence-free learning environment.
            ``(2) The widespread illegal use of alcohol and drugs among 
        the Nation's secondary school students, and increasingly by 
        students in elementary schools as well, constitutes a grave 
        threat to such students' physical and mental well-being, and 
        significantly impedes the learning process. For example, data 
        show that students who drink tend to receive lower grades and 
        are more likely to miss school because of illness than students 
        who do not drink.
            ``(3) Drug and violence prevention programs are essential 
        components of a comprehensive strategy to promote school 
        safety, youth development, positive school outcomes, and to 
        reduce the demand for and illegal use of alcohol, tobacco and 
        drugs throughout the Nation. Schools, local organizations, 
        parents, students, and communities throughout the Nation have a 
        special responsibility to work together to combat the 
        continuing epidemic of violence and illegal drug use and should 
        measure the success of their programs against clearly defined 
        goals and objectives.
            ``(4) Drug and violence prevention programs are most 
        effective when implemented within a research-based, drug and 
        violence prevention framework of proven effectiveness.
            ``(5) Research clearly shows that community contexts 
        contribute to substance abuse and violence.
            ``(6) Substance abuse and violence are intricately related 
        and must be dealt with in a holistic manner.
            ``(7) Research has documented that parental behavior and 
        environment directly influence a child's inclination to use 
        alcohol, tobacco or drugs.

``SEC. 4003. PURPOSE.

    ``The purpose of this part is to support programs that prevent 
violence in and around schools and prevent the illegal use of alcohol, 
tobacco, and drugs, involve parents, and are coordinated with related 
Federal, State, school, and community efforts and resources, through 
the provision of Federal assistance to--

        referral, and education in elementary and secondary schools for 
        the development and implementation of policies that set clear 
        and appropriate standards regarding the illegal use of alcohol, 
        tobacco and drugs, and for violent behavior (including 
        intermediate and junior high schools);

        based organizations and other public and private nonprofit 
        agencies and organizations for programs of drug and violence 
        prevention including community mobilization, early 
        intervention, rehabilitation referral, and education;
            ``(3) States for development, training, technical 
        assistance, and coordination activities; and
            ``(4) public and private nonprofit organizations to provide 
        technical assistance, conduct training, demonstrations, and 
        evaluation, and to provide supplementary services and community 
        mobilization activities for the prevention of drug use and 
        violence among students and youth.

                demonstration of willingness to comply with the 
                prohibitions of this section in a timely manner; and

    Part C of title V (20 U.S.C. 7261 et seq.) is amended to read as 
follows:

                  ``PART C--MAGNET SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE

``SEC. 5301. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) Magnet schools are a significant part of our Nation's 
        effort to achieve voluntary desegregation of our Nation's 
        schools.
            ``(2) It is in the national interest to continue the 
        Federal Government's support of school districts that are 
        implementing court-ordered desegregation plans and school 
        districts that are voluntarily seeking to foster meaningful 
        interaction among students of different racial and ethnic 
        backgrounds.
            ``(3) Desegregation can help ensure that all students have 
        equitable access to high-quality education that will prepare 
        them to function well in a technologically oriented and highly 
        competitive society comprised of people from many different 
        racial and ethnic backgrounds.
            ``(4) It is in the national interest to desegregate and 
        diversify those schools in our Nation that are racially, 
        economically, linguistically, or ethnically segregated. Such 
        segregation exists between minority and non-minority students 
        as well as among students of different minority groups.
    ``(b) Statement of Purpose.--The purpose of this part is to assist 
in the desegregation of schools served by local educational agencies by 
providing financial assistance to eligible local educational agencies 
for--
            ``(1) the elimination, reduction, or prevention of minority 
        group isolation in elementary schools and secondary schools 
        with substantial proportions of minority students which shall 
        assist in the efforts of the United States to achieve voluntary 
        desegregation in public schools;
            ``(2) the development and implementation of magnet school 
        projects that will assist local educational agencies in 
        achieving systemic reforms and providing all students the 
        opportunity to meet challenging State and local content 
        standards and challenging State and local student performance 
        standards;
            ``(3) the development and design of innovative educational 
        methods and practices;
            ``(4) courses of instruction within magnet schools that 
        will substantially strengthen the knowledge of academic 
        subjects and the grasp of tangible and marketable vocational, 
        technological and career skills of students attending such 
        schools;
            ``(5) improving the capacity of local educational agencies, 
        including through professional development, to continue 
        operating magnet schools at a high performance level after 
        Federal funding is terminated; and
            ``(6) ensuring that all students enrolled in the magnet 
        school program have equitable access to high quality education 
        that will enable the students to succeed academically and 
        continue with post secondary education or productive 
        employment.

        State, or any other State agency or official of competent 
        jurisdiction, that requires the desegregation of minority-

not make a grant under this subpart to a local educational agency for a 
fiscal year if, for such fiscal year, the State in which the local 
educational agency is located takes into consideration payments made

        preceding fiscal year, that the combined fiscal effort of the 
        local educational agency and the State, computed on either a 
        per student or aggregate expenditure basis was not less than 90 
        percent of the amount of the combined fiscal effort, computed 
        on the same basis, for the second preceding fiscal year.

                agency, for not more than 1 year at a time, if the 
                Secretary determines that the failure to comply with 
                such requirement is due to exceptional or 
                uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural 
                disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the 
                agency's financial resources.

                  ``PART B--NATIVE HAWAIIAN EDUCATION

``SEC. 9201. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This part may be cited as the `Native Hawaiian Education Act'.

``SEC. 9202. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous 
        people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants 
        of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was organized as a 
        nation and internationally recognized as a nation by the United 
        States, Britain, France, and Japan, as evidenced by treaties 
        governing friendship, commerce, and navigation.
            ``(2) At the time of the arrival of the first non-
        indigenous people in Hawai'i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian 
        people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient subsistence 
        social system based on a communal land tenure system with a 
        sophisticated language, culture, and religion.
            ``(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian 
        Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first 
        King of Hawai`i.
            ``(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized 
        the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, 
        which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended full 
        and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of Hawai`i, 
        and entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom of 
        Hawai`i to govern friendship, commerce and navigation in 1826, 
        1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.
            ``(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally 
        recognized, and indigenous government of Hawai`i, the Kingdom 
        of Hawai`i, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, 
        including United States citizens, who were assisted in their 
        efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval 
        representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. 
        Because of the participation of United States agents and 
        citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in 1993 
        the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the 
        overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians 
        to self-determination through Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. 
        1510).
            ``(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled `Joint 
        Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the 
        United States', approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), ceded 
        absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of Hawai`i, 
        including the government and crown lands of the former Kingdom 
        of Hawai`i, to the United States, but mandated that revenue 
        generated from the lands be used `solely for the benefit of the 
        inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other 
        public purposes'.
            ``(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined 
        from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, and 
        in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted the 
        Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which 
        designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands 
        for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.
            ``(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes 
        Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special 
        relationship between the United States and the Native 
        Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the 
        Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: `One thing that impressed 
        me . . . was the fact that the natives of the island who are 
        our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we are 
        trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them 
        are in poverty.'.
            ``(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique 
        status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 
        20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b-1, 
        392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the 
        National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit 
        fishing in the area `only by native Hawaiian residents of said 
        area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their 
        guidance.'.
            ``(10) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the 
        admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', approved 
        March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred 
        responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home 
        Lands to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trust 
        relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian people 
        by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, 
        including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments to 
        such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such Act.
            ``(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled `An Act to provide 
        for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', the 
        United States also ceded to the State of Hawai`i title to the 
        public lands formerly held by the United States, but mandated 
        that such lands be held by the State `in public trust' and 
        reaffirmed the special relationship that existed between the 
        United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the legal 
        responsibility to enforce the public trust responsibility of 
        the State of Hawai`i for the betterment of the conditions of 
        Native Hawaiians, as defined in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian 
        Homes Commission Act, 1920.
            ``(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed 
        that--
                    ``(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, 
                and land-based link to the indigenous people who 
                exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands, and 
                that group has never relinquished its claims to 
                sovereignty or its sovereign lands;
                    ``(B) Congress does not extend services to Native 
                Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their 
                unique status as the indigenous people of a once 
                sovereign nation as to whom the United States has 
                established a trust relationship;
                    ``(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority 
                to administer a portion of the Federal trust 
                responsibility to the State of Hawai`i;
                    ``(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is 
                comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska 
                Natives; and
                    ``(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the 
                United States have--
                            ``(i) a continuing right to autonomy in 
                        their internal affairs; and
                            ``(ii) an ongoing right of self-
                        determination and self-governance that has 
                        never been extinguished.
            ``(13) The political relationship between the United States 
        and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and 
        reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the inclusion 
        of Native Hawaiians in--

            ``(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education 
        to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native Hawaiian 
        education. The report, entitled the `Native Hawaiian 
        Educational Assessment Project', was released in 1983 and 
        documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with 
        regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, 
        were disproportionately represented in many negative social and 
        physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, 
        and had educational needs that were related to their unique 
        cultural situation, such as different learning styles and low 
        self-image.
            ``(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native 
        Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus 
        F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School 
        Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize and 
        develop supplemental educational programs to address the unique 
        conditions of Native Hawaiians.
            ``(16) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate 
        released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian 
        Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the 
        successes of the programs established under title IV of the 
        Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary 
        School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the same 
        educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. 
        Subsequent reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate and 
        other organizations have generally confirmed those findings. 
        For example--
                    ``(A) educational risk factors continue to start

        students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally in 
        reading, and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest 
        among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that

        until 1986, use of the Hawaiian language as an instructional 
        medium in education in public schools was declared unlawful. 
        The declaration caused incalculable harm to a culture that 
        placed a very high value on the power of language, as 
        exemplified in the traditional saying: `I ka `olelo no ke ola; 
        I ka `olelo no ka make. In the language rests life; In the 
        language rests death.'.

        identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional 
        beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions.

``SEC. 9301. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This part may be cited as the `Alaska Native Educational Equity, 
Support, and Assistance Act'.

``SEC. 9302. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) The attainment of educational success is critical to 
        the betterment of the conditions, long-term well-being, and 
        preservation of the culture of Alaska Natives.
            ``(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to 
        encourage the maximum participation by Alaska Natives in the 
        planning and the management of Alaska Native education 
        programs.
            ``(3) Alaska Native children enter and exit school with 
        serious educational handicaps.
            ``(4) The educational achievement of Alaska Native children 
        is far below national norms. Native performance on standardized 
        tests is low, Native student dropout rates are high, and 
        Natives are significantly underrepresented among holders of 
        baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a result, 
        Native students are being denied their opportunity to become 
        full participants in society by grade school and high school 
        educations that are condemning an entire generation to an 
        underclass status and a life of limited choices.
            ``(5) The programs authorized in this title, combined with 
        expanded Head Start, infant learning and early childhood 
        education programs, and parent education programs are essential 
        if educational handicaps are to be overcome.
            ``(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be 
        overcome in delivering educational services in rural Alaska and 
        Alaska villages should be addressed through the development and 
        implementation of innovative, model programs in a variety of 
        areas.
            ``(7) Congress finds that Native children should be 
        afforded the opportunity to begin their formal education on a 
        par with their non-Native peers. The Federal Government should 
        lend support to efforts developed by and undertaken within the 
        Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for 
        all students.

``SEC. 9303. PURPOSES.

    ``The purposes of this part are to--
            ``(1) recognize the unique educational needs of Alaska 
        Natives;

        programs to benefit Alaska Natives;
            ``(3) supplement programs and authorities in the area of 
        education to further the objectives of this part; and
            ``(4) provide direction and guidance to appropriate 
        Federal, State, and local agencies to focus resources,
