                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate in support of United States policy 
                    for a Middle East peace process.

Whereas the Road Map, endorsed by the United States, Israel, the Palestinian 
        Authority, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations, remains a 
        realistic and widely recognized plan for making progress toward peace;
Whereas, on April 14, 2004, President Bush welcomed the plan of Israeli Prime 
        Minister Ariel Sharon to remove certain military installations and all 
        settlements from Gaza, and certain military installations and 
        settlements from the West Bank;
Whereas under the Road Map, Palestinians must undertake an immediate cessation 
        of armed activity and all acts of violence against Israelis anywhere, 
        all Palestinian institutions, organizations, and individuals must end 
        incitement against Israel, the Palestinian leadership must act 
        decisively against terror (including sustained, targeted, and effective 
        operations to stop terrorism and dismantle terrorist capabilities and 
        infrastructure), and Palestinians must undertake a comprehensive and 
        fundamental political reform that includes a strong parliamentary 
        democracy and an empowered prime minister;
Whereas Prime Minister Sharon noted Israel's responsibilities under the Road Map 
        include limitations on the growth of settlements, removal of 
        unauthorized outposts, and steps to increase, to the extent permitted by 
        security needs, freedom of movement for Palestinians not engaged in 
        terrorism;
Whereas there likely will be no security for Israelis or Palestinians until they 
        and all states join together to fight terrorism and dismantle terrorist 
        organizations;
Whereas the United States remains committed to Israel's security, and well-being 
        as a Jewish State, including secure, recognized, and defensible borders, 
        and to preserving and strengthening Israel's capability to deter enemies 
        and defend itself against any threat;
Whereas Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism, including to 
        take actions against terrorist organizations that threaten Israel's 
        citizens;
Whereas, after Israel withdraws from Gaza and parts of the West Bank, existing 
        arrangements regarding control of airspace, territorial waters, and land 
        passages relating to the West Bank and Gaza are planned to continue;
Whereas, as part of a final peace settlement, Israel must have secure and 
        recognized borders, which should emerge from negotiations between the 
        parties in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 
        242 and 338;
Whereas, in light of realities on the ground, including already existing major 
        Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome 
        of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the 
        armistice lines of 1949, but realistic to expect that any final status 
        agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes 
        that reflect these realities;
Whereas Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has stated: ``the barrier being 
        erected by Israel is a security rather than political barrier, is 
        temporary rather than permanent, and should therefore not prejudice any 
        final status issues including final borders, and its route should take 
        into account, consistent with security needs, its impact on Palestinian 
        communities'';
Whereas an agreed just, fair, and realistic framework for a solution to the 
        Palestinian refugee issue as part of any final status agreement will 
        need to be found through the establishment of a Palestinian state, and 
        the settling of Palestinian refugees there, rather than in Israel;
Whereas the United States supports the establishment of a Palestinian state that 
        is viable, contiguous, sovereign, and independent, so that the 
        Palestinian people can build their own future;
Whereas the United States will join with others in the international community 
        to assist in fostering the development of Palestinian democratic 
        political institutions and new leadership committed to those 
        institutions, the reconstruction of civic institutions, the growth of a 
        free and prosperous economy, and the building of capable security 
        institutions dedicated to maintaining law and order and dismantling 
        terrorist organizations; and
Whereas in order to promote a lasting peace, all states must oppose terrorism, 
        support the emergence of a peaceful and democratic Palestine, and state 
        clearly that they will live in peace with Israel: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) endorses the above-mentioned principles and practices 
        of United States policy in the Middle East, and ongoing actions 
        to make progress toward realizing the vision of two states 
        living side by side in peace and security, as a real 
        contribution toward peace, and as important steps under the 
        Road Map;
            (2) reaffirms its commitment to a vision of two states, 
        Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security 
        as the key to peace; and
            (3) supports efforts to continue working with others in the 
        international community, to build the capacity and will of 
        Palestinian institutions to fight terrorism, dismantle 
        terrorist organizations, and prevent the areas from which 
        Israel has withdrawn from posing a threat to the security of 
        Israel.
