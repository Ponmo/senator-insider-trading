IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
August 6 (legislative day, AUGUST 5), 1992
Mr. PELL, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, reported the following
original resolution; which was placed on the calendar
RESOLUTION
Relating to authorization of multilateral action in Bosnia-Hercegovina under
Article 42 of the United Nations Charter.
Whereas the Republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina is internationally recognized as
an independent state and is a member of the United Nations and a participant
in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe;
Whereas attempts to bring about a permanent cessation of hostilities
precipitated by Serbia and Serbian-backed forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina
through negotiations have repeatedly failed;
Whereas horrible atrocities are being committed by Serbian-backed forces
against the civilian population, including the `ethnic-cleansing' of regions
inhabited by non-Serbs;
Whereas the United States and other Contracting Parties to the International
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide may,
under Article VIII, `call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to
take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider
appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide' or any
of the other `Acts Constituting Genocide' enumerated in Article III;
Whereas officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross
have been denied access to prison camps and internment camps throughout
Bosnia-Hercegovina even though such officials are entitled to access to such
camps under Article 143 of the 1949 Geneva Convention;
Whereas United Nations and Red Cross relief convoys carrying much needed
supplies of food and medicine are being repeatedly blocked and in some cases
have been attacked by Serbian-backed forces;
Whereas the Security Council of the United Nations voted unanimously to
dispatch additional forces to reopen Sarajevo's airport, and the delivery
of supplies of humanitarian assistance to the city's beleaguered population
is taking place under the protection of these forces but with great difficulty;
Whereas the Security Council also endorsed the cease-fire plan negotiated
by the European Community Envoy which would place all heavy weapons in the
possession of factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina under international supervision;
Whereas the president of the democratically elected Government of
Bosnia-Hercegovina has issued urgent appeals for immediate assistance from
the international community; and
Whereas the situation in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia-Hercegovina has
reached a critical point requiring immediate and decisive action by the
international community: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
  (1) the President should immediately call for an emergency meeting of
  the United Nations Security Council in order to authorize, under Article
  42 of the United Nations Charter, all necessary means, including the use
  of military force, giving particular consideration to the possibility of
  `demonstrations' of force as specified in Article 42, to implement--
  (a) a United Nations-sponsored effort to provide humanitarian relief to
  civilians in Bosnia-Hercegovina; and
  (b) a United Nations-sponsored plan to place heavy weapons belonging to
  all factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina under United Nations supervision;
  (2) during such meeting, the Security Council should--
  (a) consider the means by which the United Nations and International Red
  Cross personnel shall be granted access to refugee and prisoners of war
  camps in all of the republics of the former Yugoslavia;
  (b) review the effects on Bosnia-Hercegovina of the arms embargo imposed
  on all states in the former Yugoslavia pursuant to United Nations Security
  Council Resolution 713 and determine whether the termination or suspension
  of the application of that resolution to Bosnia-Hercegovina could result
  in increased security for the civilian population of that country; and
  (c) determine how to convene a tribunal to investigate allegations of
  war crimes and crimes against humanity committed within the territory of
  the former Yugoslavia and to accumulate evidence, charge, and prepare the
  basis for trying individuals believed to have committed such crimes; and
  (3) when requested by the President, the Congress should promptly consider
  authorization for any use of United States military forces pursuant to, and
  only pursuant to, the United Nations authorization described in paragraph 1.
