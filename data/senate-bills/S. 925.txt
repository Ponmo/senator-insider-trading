SEC. 811. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL AND ECONOMIC 
              SUPPORT FOR A SUCCESSOR REGIME IN IRAQ.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A peaceful and prosperous Iraq will benefit the entire 
        international community.
            (2) Winning the peace in Iraq will require the support of 
        the international community, including the assistance of the 
        United Nations and the specialized agencies of the United 
        Nations.
            (3) While Iraq's long-term economic prospects are good, the 
        short-term economic situation will be difficult.
            (4) Iraq has an estimated $61,000,000,000 in foreign debt, 
        approximately $200,000,000,000 in pending reparations claims 
        through the United National Compensation Commission, and an 
        unknown amount of potential liability for terrorism-related 
        claims brought in United States courts.
            (5) The revenue from the export of oil from Iraq is 
        projected to be less than $15,000,000,000 each year for the 
        years 2004, 2005, and 2006.
    (b) Sense of Congress on a Successor Regime in Iraq.--It is the 
sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should be commended for seeking the 
        support of the international community to build a stable and 
        secure Iraq;
            (2) the President's position that the oil resources of 
        Iraq, and the revenues derived therefrom, are the sovereign 
        possessions of the people of Iraq should be supported; and
            (3) the President should pursue measures, in cooperation 
        with other nations, to protect an interim or successor regime 
        in Iraq, to the maximum extent possible, from the negative 
        economic implications of indebtedness incurred by the regime of 
        Saddam Hussein, and to assist in developing a resolution of all 
        outstanding claims against Iraq.

SEC. 812. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO MAGEN DAVID ADOM SOCIETY.

    It is the sense of Congress that, in light of the findings of fact 
set out in section 690(a) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228; 116 Stat. 1414) and the fact that 
the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has not granted 
full membership to the Magen David Adom Society, the United States 
should continue to press for full membership for the Magen David Adom 
Society in the International Red Cross Movement.

SEC. 813. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in 
        atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are 
        contributing to global climate change.
            (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
        has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that 
        most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is 
        attributable to human activities'' and that the average 
        temperature on Earth can be expected to rise between 2.5 and 
        10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.
            (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings 
        of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPCC's conclusion that most of 
        the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have 
        been due to the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations 
        accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific 
        community on this issue'' and that ``there is general agreement 
        that the observed warming is real and particularly strong 
        within the past twenty years''. The National Academy of 
        Sciences also noted that ``because there is considerable 
        uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system 
        varies naturally and reacts to emissions of greenhouse gases 
        and aerosols, current estimates of the magnitude of future 
        warming should be regarded as tentative and subject to future 
        adjustments upward or downward''.
            (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years the 
        global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has 
        increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, which 
        threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and coastal 
        regions throughout the world.
            (5) In October 2000, a United States Government report 
        found that global climate change may harm the United States by 
        altering crop yields, accelerating sea-level rise, and 
        increasing the spread of tropical infectious diseases.
            (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations 
        Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the ultimate 
        objective of which is the ``stabilization of greenhouse gas 
        concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent 
        dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. 
        Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient 
        to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to 
        ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable 
        economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner''.
            (7) The UNFCCC stated in part that the Parties to the 
        Convention are to implement policies ``with the aim of 
        returning . . . to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emissions of 
        carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases'' under the principle 
        that ``policies and measures . . . should be appropriate for 
        the specific conditions of each Party and should be integrated 
        with national development programmes, taking into account that 
        economic development is essential for adopting measures to 
        address climate change''.
            (8) There is a shared international responsibility to 
        address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest 
        historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases, and 
        developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in 
        the future.
            (9) The UNFCCC further stated that ``developed country 
        Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and 
        the adverse effects thereof'', as these nations are the largest 
        historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases. The UNFCCC 
        also stated that ``steps required to understand and address 
        climate change will be environmentally, socially and 
        economically most effective if they are based on relevant 
        scientific, technical and economic considerations and 
        continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in these 
        areas''.
            (10) Senate Resolution 98 of the One Hundred Fifth 
        Congress, which expressed that developing nations must also be 
        included in any future, binding climate change treaty and such 
        a treaty must not result in serious harm to the United States 
        economy, should not cause the United States to abandon its 
        shared responsibility to help reduce the risks of climate 
        change and its impacts. Future international efforts in this 
        regard should focus on recognizing the equitable 
        responsibilities for addressing climate change by all nations, 
        including commitments by the largest developing country 
        emitters in a future, binding climate change treaty.
            (11) While the United States has elected not to become a 
        party to the Kyoto Protocol at this time, it is the position of 
        the United States that it will not interfere with the plans of 
        any nation that chooses to ratify and implement the Kyoto 
        Protocol to the UNFCCC.
            (12) American businesses need to know how governments 
        worldwide will address the risks of climate change.
            (13) The United States benefits from investments in the 
        research, development, and deployment of a range of clean 
        energy and efficiency technologies that can reduce the risks of 
        climate change and its impacts and that can make the United 
        States economy more productive, bolster energy security, create 
        jobs, and protect the environment.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should demonstrate international leadership and responsibility 
in reducing the health, environmental, and economic risks posed by 
climate change by--
            (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and 
        meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from all 
        sectors;
            (2) creating flexible international and domestic 
        mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology 
        deployment, tradable credits for emissions reductions and 
        carbon sequestration projects that will reduce, avoid, and 
        sequester greenhouse gas emissions;
            (3) participating in international negotiations, including 
        putting forth a proposal to the Conference of the Parties, with 
        the objective of securing United States participation in a 
        future binding climate change Treaty in a manner that is 
        consistent with the environmental objectives of the UNFCCC, 
        that protects the economic interests of the United States, and 
        that recognizes the shared international responsibility for 
        addressing climate change, including developing country 
        participation; and
            (4) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group 
        designated by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee 
        on Foreign Relations of the Senate, to monitor any 
        international negotiations on climate change, to ensure that 
        the advice and consent function of the Senate is exercised in a 
        manner so as to facilitate timely consideration of any new 
        treaty submitted to the Senate.

(22 U.S.C. 6435(a)) is amended by striking ``2003'' and inserting

           TITLE IX--PEACE CORPS CHARTER FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for the 21st 
Century Act''.

SEC. 902. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote 
        world peace and friendship through the service of United States 
        volunteers abroad.
            (2) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as 
        follows:
                    (A) To help people in developing nations meet basic 
                needs.
                    (B) To promote understanding of America's values 
                and ideals abroad.
                    (C) To promote an understanding of other peoples by 
                Americans.
            (3) The three goals, which are codified in the Peace Corps 
        Act, have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the 
        years, and worked in concert to promote global acceptance of 
        the principles of international peace and nonviolent 
        coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of 
        government.
            (4) Since its establishment, approximately 165,000 Peace 
        Corps volunteers have served in 135 countries.
            (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps 
        remains the world's premier international service organization 
        dedicated to promoting grassroots development.
            (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well 
        trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to 
        promote peace, friendship, and international understanding.
            (7) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual 
        budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps 
        volunteers.
            (8) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore 
        no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should be used to 
        accomplish any goal other than the goals established by the 
        Peace Corps Act.
            (9) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in 
        harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps 
        volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum 
        extent the talent pool of returned Peace Corps volunteers.
            (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation 
        about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, 
        particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a 
        greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster 
        greater understanding and tolerance.
            (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be 
        expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps volunteers.
            (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling 
        of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service.
            (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps must not jeopardize 
        the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and 
        therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase 
        in field and headquarters support staff.
            (14) In order to ensure that proposed expansion of the 
        Peace Corps preserves the integrity of the program and the 
        security of volunteers, the integrated Planning and Budget 
        System supported by the Office of Planning and Policy Analysis 
        should continue its focus on strategic planning.
            (15) A streamlined, bipartisan National Peace Corps 
        Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace Corps 
        volunteers and other individuals, with diverse backgrounds and 
        expertise, can be a source of ideas and suggestions that may be 
        useful to the Director of the Peace Corps in discharging the 
        Director's duties and responsibilities.

returned Peace Corps volunteers to develop and carry out programs and 
projects to promote the third purpose of the Peace Corps Act, as set 
forth in section 2(a) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 2501(a)), relating to 
promoting an understanding of other peoples on the part of the American 
people.
    (b) Grants to Certain Nonprofit Corporations.--
            (1) Grant authority.--The Chief Executive Officer of the 
        Corporation for National and Community Service (hereafter in 
        the section referred to as the ``Corporation'') shall award 
        grants on a competitive basis to private nonprofit corporations

                knowledge and interest of elementary school and 
secondary school students in the geography and cultures of other 
countries where the volunteers have served;
                    (B) projects that involve partnerships with local 
                libraries to enhance community knowledge about other 
                peoples and countries; and
                    (C) audio-visual projects that utilize materials 
                collected by the volunteers during their service that
