 [Struck out->]   The Congress finds that-- [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (1) There are between 23 and 27 million adult Americans
 who are functionally illiterate, a number which is increasing due to
 disproportionately high drop out rates in the public schools among minorities;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (2) the Adult Education Act is the only major program
 to reduce illiteracy in the United States and serves only 10 percent of
 eligible participants, while all public and private literacy programs serve
 only about 19 percent of those who need help; [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (3) illiteracy is a problem of intergenerational nature;
 [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (4) as many as 50 million workers may have to be trained
 or retrained between now and the year 2000; and [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   (5) the supply of unskilled workers is increasing and the
 demand for unskilled labor is decreasing. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->] SEC. 3. DEFINITION. [<-Struck out]
 [Struck out->]   As used in this Act the term `literacy' means the knowledge
 and skills necessary to communicate, including the reading, writing, basic
 skills, speaking, and listening skills normally associated with the ability
 to function at a level greater than the 8th grade level. [<-Struck out]

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--

  illiterate, a number which is increasing due to disproportionately high
  drop out rates in the public schools among minorities;
  (2) the Adult Education Act is the only major program to reduce illiteracy
  in the United States and serves only 10 percent of eligible participants,
  while all public and private literacy programs serve only about 19 percent
  of those who need help;
  (3) illiteracy is a problem of intergenerational nature;
  (4) effective literacy training in our Nation's schools, particularly at
  the elementary level, is essential to preventing further growth in national
  illiteracy rates;
  (5) as many as 50 million workers may have to be trained or retrained
  between now and the year 2000; and
  (6) the supply of unskilled workers is increasing and the demand for
  unskilled labor is decreasing.
SEC. 3. DEFINITION.
  As used in this Act the term `literacy' means the knowledge and skills
  necessary to communicate, including the reading, writing, basic skills,
  computation, speaking, and listening skills normally associated with the
  ability to function at a level greater than the 8th grade level so that
  education, employment, citizenry and family life is enhanced.
